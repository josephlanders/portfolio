2.) Produce a list of all salespeople that do not have any order with Samsonic.

// Salespeople that have orders but not with samsonic (should therefore exclude Bob and Ken who have orders with samsonic) and (should exclude Chris and Joe as they have no orders at all)

   FROM salesperson 
   INNER JOIN

                WHERE customer.name='Samsonic'))B 
   ON salesperson.id = B.salesperson_id;
