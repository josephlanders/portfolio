I haven't uploaded the entire code as it could result in plaigarism from RMIT students.<br/>
If you'd like to see the entire assignment in the 3 languages I can email you the code<br/>

The assignment is to index a large list of <DOC> </DOC> elements which contact <TEXT></TEXT> and are news documents.<br/>
The management of this index file (inverted list in memory then disk) is done by the Invlists_manager.<br/>

The Searcher is used to search for terms once the indexing is complete and determine which <DOC> these terms occur in.<br/>
