I haven't uploaded the entire code as it could result in plaigarism from RMIT students.<br/>
If you'd like to see the entire assignment in the 3 languages I can email you the code<br/>

The assignment is to index a large list of DOC elements which contain TEXT elements and are news documents.<br/>
The management of this index file (inverted list stored in memory then written to disk) is done by the Invlists_manager.<br/>

The Searcher is used to search for terms once the indexing is complete and determine which DOC elements these terms occur in.<br/>
