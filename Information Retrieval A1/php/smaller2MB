NEW FALLOUT FROM CHERNOBYL; 
</P>
<P>
THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER BY DAVID R. MARPLES (ST. MARTIN'S 
PRESS: $35, CLOTH; $14.95, PAPER; 316 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-312-02432-0)

By James E. Oberg , Oberg, a space engineer in Houston, is the author of 
Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost (Random House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The onset of the new Gorbachev policy of glasnost, commonly mistranslated as 
openness but closer in connotation to candor or publicizing, has complicated 
the task of Soviet secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new Western 
insights into Soviet society. David R. Marples' new book, his second on the 
Chernobyl accident of April 26, 1986, is a shining example of the best type of 
non-Soviet analysis into topics that only recently were absolutely taboo in 
Moscow official circles. 
</P>
<P>
The author, a British-educated historian and economist, is a research associate 
with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta, 
and the academic style of the book is undisguised. However, its intended 
audience is the general public, and anyone interested in nuclear power, or 
Soviet economy and society, or human drama, or just plain sleuthing state 
secrets, will find hitherto unpublished revelations and explanations of the 
event and its continuing aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of Chernobyl reverberated throughout so many facets of Soviet 
society that a continuous coherent narrative is probably impossible. Marples 
discusses half a dozen major themes arranged in a fairly arbitrary order (as 
indicated by the frequent and helpful cross references throughout the text) and 
succeeds in mapping out his main themes. The personal interests of each reader 
determine which of the sections may be deemed too detailed and which too 
sketchy, but considering the need for such a comprehensive overview, the levels 
are generally appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The book is, on the one hand, not a light read, and an executive summary might 
have been possible in a quarter the length. But, on the other, so many of the 
judgments depend on a subtle interpretation of a multitude of sources that the 
author is obligated to present the raw data for the reader's inspection. The 
modular nature of the book also allows a reader to skip, browse, and revisit 
earlier sections, aided by a convenient internal organization and a thorough 
index. 
</P>
<P>
First in the world's attention, and in the text, is a discussion of the human 
victims of the accident. The official tally is 31 (only about 20 names have 
ever been released), but Marples suspects there were other short-term radiation 
victims. A large number of unnecessary late-term abortions were also performed 
on local women, and by rights those unborn babies count as casualties. 
Widespread "radiophobia" led to restricted diets which created malnourishment 
and subsequent disease in thousands of people. The tens of thousands of people 
taking part in cleanup operations were never included in official totals of 
those exposed. Since the book went to press, Soviet military sources have 
referred to at least one death in the actual reactor entombment program. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest toll is likely to occur with the delayed deaths. Here, Marples 
encounters for the first time the soon familiar theme of official Soviet 
myth-making around the event: Reality is twisted to serve state policy 
objectives, which include calming an alarmed public with assurances that all is 
well when it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
And thus is born what he properly labels the "myth of Chernobyl," the official 
line that the disaster provided a test that Soviet society passed with honor. 
"In the Soviet view," he writes, "it was first and foremost a victory, a story 
with an ending, and an ending that was triumphant." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when sober Western medical estimates placed the future "excess cancer 
deaths" at several tens of thousands, both in the Soviet Union and in Europe (a 
few tenths of a percent elevation of the natural cancer rate), the Soviets 
reacted furiously. The estimates are branded "nonsense" and the estimators are 
dismissed as "panic mongers" promulgating "anti-Soviet venom." 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently the author addresses themes of environmental impact, economic and 
political repercussions, public images, and the recovery operations. Along the 
way, Marples provides a damning list of examples in which Soviet officials 
attempted to retreat behind old-style cover-ups and outright lies. False 
information was issued on radiation levels, on subsequent accidents at the 
site, on contamination levels of the Kiev water supply, on severe discipline 
against non-volunteer cleanup personnel, on reactor entombment schedules and on 
operator training levels. 
</P>
<P>
A severe 1986-1987 countrywide electrical power shortage was officially denied 
although it was real enough to compel the restart of three Chernobyl reactors 
in explicit violation of Soviet safety regulations. Design deficiencies of the 
Chernobyl-style reactors were downplayed and human errors were declared to be 
the primary culprit. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, observes the author, "It is ironic that in an era of openness, 
Chernobyl may have been both the pioneer of glasnost under Gorbachev and then 
subsequently its first casualty." He ultimately concludes, "Aspects of the 
disaster . . . have rarely been dealt with thoroughly or even honestly by 
Soviet sources." Hence the need for this book, a need which is admirably 
fulfilled despite the many remaining mysteries and uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
The July, 1987, trial of reactor personnel marked a full circle of disclosure. 
Journalists were allowed into the pre-scripted first and last days, but the 
weeklong deliberative sessions were held in secret and no word of their 
substance has ever been released. 
</P>
<P>
The propaganda purpose of the trial and surrounding official publicity, he 
maintains, had one goal: "To divert culpability from the party hierarchy, in 
Kiev and especially in Moscow." This is precisely the theme I have also 
encountered in my own investigations of aerospace accidents of the past. Where 
individual human failings led to catastrophe, a sanitized story may eventually 
be released, but where Kremlin policy led to disaster (such as the Nedelin 
catastrophe of 1960 or the Soyuz-1 disaster in 1967), the entire event remains 
absolutely off limits to glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
The closing blow-by-blow description of the nuclear power debate presages a 
dramatic event which occurred too recently for inclusion in this first edition. 
Viktor Legasov, tagged by the author as one of the country's two leading 
pro-nuclear advocates, actually was sinking into private despair over the poor 
implementation of safety standards. In the end, he made his final and most 
eloquent testimony to this despair on the second anniversary of the accident, 
by committing suicide. For several weeks the Soviets tried to sit on the 
circumstances of his "tragic death," even issuing official non-explanations 
which asserted that the death was not due to medical effects of radiation. 
Finally, crusading journalist Vladimir Gubarev, with access to Legasov's 
notebooks, broke the story in Pravda. Readers of this book will come to know 
these and other characters so well that the suicide fits right into the "big 
picture" of the catastrophe's social impacts. 
</P>
<P>
For an author to so accurately describe a social milieu that subsequent 
unpredictable events only enhance his insights is testimony to the highest 
quality of scholarship. Readers of Marples' book will rarely be surprised as 
the Chernobyl catastrophe's consequences continue to unfold in the future.

<P>
TOCQUEVILLE A BIOGRAPHY BY ANDRE JARDIN; TRANSLATED BY LYDIA DAVIS WITH ROBERT 
HEMENWAY(FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $30; 548 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Annette J. Smith and David R. Smith , Both Smiths are professors at Caltech 
and co-translators and editors of 'Mademoiselle Irnois' and Other Stories by 
Arthur de Gobineau (University of California Press), who was, among other 
things, Tocqueville's secretary. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Jardin's "Tocqueville," surprisingly the first full-scale biography of 
this major 19th-Century figure, is a fine, old-fashioned piece of work, some of 
it original, much of it taken from the ample precedent scholarship. It provides 
an abundant store of information and an occasional surprise -- a dozen years 
after its publication, we find the author of "Democracy in America," now 
minister of foreign affairs, exclaiming: "But what animals these Americans 
are!" 
</P>
<P>
It is as the author of "Democracy in America" that Tocqueville is known in this 
country; but what this biography reveals is not so much an admirer of America 
as a Frenchman of his time, circumstance and needs, even when he is in America. 
He came here with his friend Beaumont ostensibly as a student of penitentiary 
reform, but Tocqueville really wanted to take a larger look at this new 
republic, since it was clear to him that the European drift was in that 
direction, and what intrigued him was its democratic base, since he had been 
brought up to believe that a republic could function only when run by a 
virtuous elite. We know what he found and how he responded, but the biography 
also reveals, almost inadvertently, why he was such an accurate and 
comparatively unbiased observer. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he had not biased himself by reading contemporary travel 
literature, much of it written by snide Tories pretending to take an 
unprejudiced look at the American experiment. Capt. Basil Hall's infamous 
"Travels" had been only partially translated (the chapter on prison reform) 
into French, and, in any event, it was his companion Beaumont who read it. The 
result was that Tocqueville's vision had not been prejudiced (other than by his 
relative Chateaubriand's romance with New World nature). For another, 
Tocqueville and Beaumont readied themselves each day by preparing questions for 
the people they would meet, questions based upon their own observations sur 
place and designed to elicit responses useful to them as Frenchmen trying to 
prepare themselves for a possible future. They were not, as were the Tories, 
justifying a past. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's Cartesian clarity, his relative lack of bias, meant that he used 
the answers to his questions to form a useful statement about America, but the 
questions themselves and their reasons reveal perhaps even more about France. 
By looking at this intelligent, open-minded, and inquiring young civil servant 
and nobleman of impeccable political parentage (great grandson of Malesherbes), 
Jardin's book provides the American reader a marvelous introduction to the 
political shiftings, the gradual yet sometimes violent post-revolutionary 
cracking of the political structure in France as it grappled simultaneously 
with the shattered legitimacy of the past, a slippery present and an 
ill-defined future. 
</P>
<P>
After the immediate success of "Democracy in America" (1835), Tocqueville 
entered the political arena and was elected deputy for the arrondissement of 
Valognes, the region of his family castle in Normandy. He sat left of center in 
the Chamber. Although many at the time thought of him as an Carlist aristocrat 
and some in this country think of him as an American-style conservative, 
Tocqueville considered the old aristocracy "dead for ever." Over the years, he 
demonstrated his liberalism by fighting for parliamentary monarchy, separation 
of church and state, reform of the suffrage laws, improvement of the worker's 
lot, for liberalizing public education, abolishing slavery wherever it existed, 
improving the prison system and eliminating poverty. He managed, nevertheless, 
to stay clear of several more powerful champions of liberal causes such as 
Lamartine, Royer-Collard, and Thiers, who would have liked to have him on their 
side but whose egos he mistrusted. 
</P>
<P>
Independence is what most characterizes Tocqueville's career. A colleague 
reproached him for "giving the right hand to the left, the left to the right 
and regretting that he does not have a third one to give invisibly." "Freedom 
is the strongest of my passions. Voila. It is the truth," he explained to 
disconcerted observers. If he moved left, it was, he claimed, to impose his 
color on the left, not change his own. 
</P>
<P>
Another constant was his hatred of centralization. In "L'Ancien Regime et la 
Revolution," Tocqueville analyzed the roots of centralization in France, which 
according to him went as far back as the reign of Philip the Fair in the Middle 
Ages. He lamented the fact that centralization had destroyed time-tested local 
organic structures and that the French nobility itself was at fault in the 
process. Tocqueville fought centralism in all of its manifestations as he saw 
them. For instance, rather an agnostic himself, he defended religious education 
because he believed in the healthy necessity of a third force besides the state 
and the people. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's anticentralism colored his responses to the various colonial 
enterprises that characterize European history of the period. Thus, in newly 
conquered Algeria, he favored a kind of settlement based on local autonomy 
rather than central metropolitan power. He was the first man in the Chamber to 
push for a separate ministry for Algeria -- a dream that became a fact only a 
century later in Leon Blum's cabinet. He deplored the downfall of the Ottoman 
Empire in the Middle East, since the Turks were not only a desirable bumper 
between the major European predators, but also relatively tolerant themselves 
toward the diversity of their possessions. He admired the respect for local 
customs that the British had shown in India. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville was an active, intelligent legislator, esteemed particularly for 
his work on penitentiary reform (inspired by the Philadelphia system) and on 
the abolition of slavery, but he was not a sensational figurehead. One might 
say that, like Montaigne, he had lived through a great deal of political 
turmoil and managed to preserve an independent judgment. When Louis-Napoleon 
was propelled into the presidency at the end of the bloody 1848 revolution, 
Tocqueville was given the foreign affairs ministry in the Barrot cabinet. He 
served with the same unsensational distinction as in the Chamber but was fired 
after only five months. He had protested Louis-Napoleon's coup d'etat that made 
an emperor of the president and was briefly imprisoned in Vincennes -- luckier 
in this than one of our great-grandfathers, who was sent to the Sahara for the 
same offense. From then to his death from tuberculosis in Cannes in 1859, 
Tocqueville led the life of a gentleman farmer and journalist who, amid 
numerous changes of residence to accommodate his health, wrote (but did not 
finish) "L'Ancien Regime et la Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
This long and scrupulous study of a man who was one of the most profound and 
prophetic thinkers of his time, is, alas, scrupulous to the point of boredom. 
The narration rarely deviates from an inexhaustible concatenation of facts 
related in the soberest of prose. Although it does justice to Tocqueville's 
ideas, it fails in rendering the passion and the grace of his intellectual life 
and the social brilliance of the era. Moreover, the book is curiously 
organized: The order followed a mixture of the chronological and of the 
thematic, with several baffling leaps from one to the other. Andre Jardin's 
work constitutes an excellent work of reference for the scholar. It is indexed 
and substantially but not cumbersomely footnoted. Still it makes the layman 
yearn for the livelier manner of much recent historical writing.

TUNGSTEN A NOVEL BY CESAR VALLEJO; TRANSLATED BY ROBERT MEZEY; FOREWORD BY 
KEVIN J. O'CONNOR (SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $19.95; 168 PP.; 0-8156-0226-X)

By Edith Grossman, Grossman is a critic and translator of Latin American 
literature. She teaches at Dominican College in New York State, is the author 
of The Antipoetry of Nicanor Parra and recently translated Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera.

<TEXT>
<P>
Why read "Tungsten," a partisan novel written almost 60 years ago in which evil 
is unmitigated, virtue unblemished, and the characters seem to lack dimension 
or complexity as they play out their predetermined roles on the stage of the 
class struggle? Why read a book in which ideology reigns supreme, and why 
celebrate its first, belated translation into English? Because the author is 
Cesar Vallejo, one of the great poets of the 20th Century and a major figure in 
Latin American literature. 
</P>
<P>
Vallejo created a wrenching poetic language for Spanish that radically altered 
the shape of its imagery and the nature of its rhythms. No facile trend setter, 
Vallejo forged a new discourse in order to express his own visceral compassion 
for human suffering. He saw the world in piercing flashes of outrage and 
anguish, terror and pity, and what he saw wounded him like knife thrusts. A 
passionate, tragic poet, he mourned our loss of moral innocence and despaired 
of the injustice that moves the world. In the late 1920s, when he was living in 
Paris and eking out a meager livelihood as a journalist, the pain at the roots 
of his being found objective substantiation in radical politics. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the Peruvian Andes in 1892, he witnessed firsthand the victimization 
and exploitation of the South American Indians. Although his own family was not 
financially destitute (his father was a notary and minor bureaucrat in the 
small town of Santiago de Chuco), Vallejo was a cholo, a person born of mixed 
European and Indian ancestry. The fact is not irrelevant. In a society where 
social and economic status followed the color line with cosmic certainty, where 
racial discrimination was rigidly adhered to although rarely acknowledged in 
public, the representatives of foreign companies, with the wholehearted 
complicity of domestic colleagues, extracted high profits from the near-slavery 
of the illiterate, utterly alienated and ultimately helpless victims of that 
racism. Vallejo had ample opportunity to witness the brutalization en masse of 
the Indian underclass and the appalling greed of their lighter-skinned masters 
who carried on the colonial tradition of using Indians as forced labor in mines 
and on plantations. 
</P>
<P>
Twentieth-Century writers from Ciro Alegria to Manuel Scorza have denounced the 
Peruvian tragedy in their books. "Tungsten" was one of the earliest novels to 
do so in modern terms. As a young man, however, Vallejo's greatest energies 
were devoted to writing and publishing his poems ("Los heraldos negros," his 
first book, appeared in 1918); consequently, he remained on the periphery of 
the windstorms of political and social unrest that swept through South America 
in the second decade of the century, although he was in the time and place 
where growing agitation to establish justice for Peruvian Indians and workers 
began its inexorable march toward Marxism. 
</P>
<P>
Vallejo, Jose Carlos Mariategui (the "Shining Path" in today's Peru takes its 
name from his writings) and Victor Raul Haya de la Torre (a founder of the 
important APRA movement -- the "Popular Revolutionary American Alliance") 
crossed paths at the university in Trujillo. But Vallejo was an intermittent 
student. His family began to experience economic difficulties during his 
adolescence, and he was obliged to interrupt secondary school and then his 
university studies to take a series of jobs, which included office work in the 
mines at Tambores and Quiruvilca, and on a large sugar plantation in the 
Chicama Valley. 
</P>
<P>
These facts are not irrelevant either. They provided the historical raw 
material for "Tungsten," the documented background to Vallejo's outcry against 
the grim realities of Indian life in Peru. The shape that material would take 
-- his conviction that the problem of race was indistinguishable from the 
problem of class -- was determined by his increasingly active commitment to 
socialism, a political engagement that, by 1930, led to his expulsion from 
France, where he had gone to live seven years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The action of the novel is centered in a fictional mining town and its 
provincial capital, Colca. The time is 1917, just before the U.S. entry into 
World War I when a ready supply of tungsten would be crucial to the weapons 
industry. A North American corporation takes over the mine, and the boom is on: 
Peasants are first lured and then coerced into working for the company, local 
Indians, the Soras, are cheated of their land and animals, petit bourgeois 
entrepreneurs scramble on the backs of the poor for wealth and position, and 
venal officials and dignitaries find a new source of bribery and 
power-brokering in the foreign capitalists. The first two-thirds of the book, 
in fact, constitutes a genre study of unashamed thuggery, a series of vignettes 
of corruption, repression and brutality that sets the stage for the violent 
heart of "Tungsten" and the appearance of its proletarian Indian hero, Servando 
Huanca. 
</P>
<P>
Two Indian boys are forcibly conscripted into military service (the military as 
well as the mining contractors have "body quotas" -- numbers of recruits or 
workers that must be obtained by any means), and on the long march from their 
homes to Colca, when they are tied by the waist to the mules that their captors 
ride, they are so badly abused that one of them eventually dies. Outside the 
Subprefecture an angry crowd gathers, indignant at the visible signs of the 
conscripts' mistreatment. One defiant man, Servando Huanca, steps forward to 
speak for the crowd with natural authority and an instinctive class 
consciousness. These qualities inspire the people and momentarily cow the 
authorities, but then the troops are ordered to fire into the crowd, and later 
that night officially sanctioned vigilantes pursue any Indian they can find, 
shooting to kill. Some, however, are taken into custody, and deals are struck 
by sleazy officials which allow the prisoners to be sent off to a sure death in 
the mines to help fulfill the company's "body quota." 
</P>
<P>
Last and certainly least, the third section of the book is a kind of postscript 
to the Colca massacre. Vallejo allows his indignation and passion to turn into 
mechanical ideology: Servando Huanca "duckspeaks" a mercifully brief exercise 
in orthodoxy, proclaiming that world revolution is under way, that it will be 
led by a militant proletariat inspired by Lenin and not by bourgeois 
"intellectuals," that it will sweep away the ruling classes in Peru. Vallejo 
even permits the novel to end with this ponderously symbolic sentence: 
"Outside, the wind was rising, portending storm." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin J. O'Connor has written a thoughtful and informative foreword, Robert 
Mezey has done a fine job of translating Vallejo's often quirky Spanish, and 
both of them deserve our gratitude for their sensitivity and skill in bringing 
the work to the attention of an English-language audience. I am sorry that I 
cannot say as much for the editing. The typographical errors are frequent and 
unforgivable, and there is no indication as one reads that Mezey has provided 
important end notes to the text. This is a disservice to the reader; Vallejo 
and his translator deserve better.

EXTINCT IN THE LAND OF FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
WHO WILL REMEMBER THE PEOPLE BY JEAN RASPAIL; TRANSLATED BY JEREMY LEGGATT 
(MERCURY HOUSE: $18.95; 215 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Schmitt , Schmitt is a professor of Latin American literature at CSU 
Long Beach whose latest work is a translation of Chilean poet Raul Zurita's 
Anteparadise (University of California Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four tribes of the now-extinct native Americans that once inhabited the 
Tierra del Fuego archipelago -- that ships' graveyard along the land's end, 
southern tip of South America -- were among the most primitive and hardy 
peoples encountered in the New World. In this fine piece of historical fiction 
cum-exemplary story, French novelist Jean Raspail explores the sad fate of the 
Alacalufs (who called themselves Kaweskar, "The People"), the lesser known of 
the two tribes of sea-nomads or "canoe Indians." 
</P>
<P>
Raspail reconstructs the history of the Alacalufs through their own eyes and 
those of Magellan, Drake and other historical figures. In this noble quest of 
the "other" (those whose languages and customs seemed so alien to Europeans 
that they refused to admit that they belonged to the human species), the view 
from "within" is attempted through a synopsis of generations, of millennia, in 
the mind of the character Lafko, a kind of collective memory of the Alacalufs. 
The view from "without" reveals a shameful history of smug disdain: From 
Magellan on, Europeans judged the Alacalufs to be "ugly," "stinking," 
"disgusting," "brutish," "beasts," "animals"; they kidnaped them, enslaved them 
and, at worst, their genocidal instincts unleashed, they turned their guns and 
cannons on them for sport, exterminated them; in the end, they were hunted for 
bounty or herded into missionary stations where they died of white man's 
diseases or the despair of captivity, and the last stragglers were reduced to 
bartering and begging in the shipping lanes of the Strait of Magellan. The 
complicity of scientists (like Darwin) in fostering this outcome is addressed 
in a couple of the chapters. 
</P>
<P>
The other side of the coin -- that our survival, too, depends on our ability to 
embrace others not as a function of our own ideal but of theirs -- is seen in 
the tragic fate of the inhabitants of Name of Jesus and the City of King 
Philip, Spain's first settlement communities in Tierra del Fuego,who went mad 
or starved to death. The English privateer Cavendish rechristened the latter 
city Port Famine. 
</P>
<P>
The point is brought home in the moving chapter, "A Civilized Gentleman." Sir 
John Byron, shipwrecked in the Strait in his youth and rescued by the 
Alacalufs, returns to the scene years later and ponders the legacy of European 
contacts: "What an endless history of contempt is unraveled! And yet . . . ." 
An instinct for survival had not saved his fellow castaways. He alone had 
survived by crossing the cultural abyss and living with the Alacaluf clan for 
six months, and the clan had braved the seas and their fears of the world 
beyond their territory to set him down on an island from which Chilotan seal 
hunters returned him to Puerto Montt. 
</P>
<P>
But when Raspail attempts to give us a glimpse from within (the inner life of 
the Alacalufs), the reader is aware of a European mind wedged between him and 
the "other." The Alacalufs are "endlessly fleeing," "forsaken" pariahs, 
"commanded by fate to survive, not to live" in a land shrouded in "an eternally 
black sky," "a witches' dance of cruel winds," "a hell of snow and winds." 
</P>
<P>
But this area is also stunningly beautiful, and Father Martin Gusinde has 
compared the Yamana, a sister tribe, to 'fidgety birds of passage who were 
happy and inwardly calm only when they were on the move'). In two recent works, 
Bruce Chatwin ("The Songlines") and Mario Vargas Llosa ("El Hablador" ("The 
Speaker") ) convincingly draw the reader into the soul-life, the Earth-bound 
myths and legends of the Australian Bushmen and the Peruvian Machiguengas, 
respectively. Raspail is far less successful in a parallel attempt with the 
Alacalufs, and the fault is not in Jeremy Leggatt's translation, which is 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that limitation, Raspail's story, inscribed in the dialogue of cultures 
so characteristic of our age, is a fine version in historical fiction of a true 
story loud with ethical reverberations. As First-World nations, we are 
collectively responsible for the fate of colonized and subjugated peoples in 
the Third World, but we have hardly begun to address those responsibilities.

Shirley Temple Black will be playing a return engagement in Pasadena when she 
presides over the Tournament of Roses Parade on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As a curly-headed child star, she was grand marshal of the 1939 parade 50 years 
ago, the youngest in the parade's history. Now, she's been invited back to be 
grand marshal of the 100th Rose Parade, which starts Monday at 8 a.m. (to be 
covered on various TV stations; see Watchables for details). She joins a select 
group of others who have been grand marshals twice: Bob Hope, Richard Nixon and 
Earl Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Riding in the parade with Mrs. Black this year will be her granddaughter, 
Teresa Falaschi, shown with her on the cover.

FICTION IN BRIEF: ROCK ME 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

This novel's hip style, smooth tone and sensual spirit distinctively recall the 
music of Steely Dan, a resemblance which turns out to be more than accidental, 
for Marcelle Clements lives with Donald Fagen, Steely Dan's lead singer and 
composer. Clements, a journalist, wrote "Rock Me" in part to evoke the lives of 
the musicians she first met at New York City's High School of Music and Art and 
then toured with in a yearlong stint as one of Fagen's backup singers. On this 
level, "Rock Me" is absorbing and believable. Casey and Michael, Clements' 
protagonists, are accurate portrayals of 1960s rockers grappling with the late 
1980s. Up on shrinks, down on drugs (after years of riding high) and longing 
for friendship though often sidetracked by lust, they speak in a delightfully 
spacey dialect from somewhere in between the San Fernando Valley and the New 
School for Social Research: "It's just been a horrible grind for so long," 
Casey tells Michael, "that now I have this, like, unbelievable negative tropism 
about all of it." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Clements' language, with no evidence of satire, strays from the 
eccentric to the insipid. "You really have a great tan," Casey tells Michael. 
"I hope so," he responds. "Because that's all I have." Clements' point of view 
is also stylistically problematic, changing from first to third person for no 
apparent reason. A final problem is Clements' attempt to study a love triangle. 
Casey, the burnt-out lead singer in a highly successful band, leaves New York 
City to recuperate in Hawaii. There, she meets Michael, her former lover and 
band partner, and his girlfriend Leslie. Sensing the desire between Casey and 
Michael, Leslie, hardly monogamous herself, sanctions an affair between the 
two. Casey and Michael eventually make love, but rather than confronting her 
feelings toward Michael, Casey abruptly returns to New York, riddled with guilt 
over her "dirty deed." 
</P>
<P>
Clements' portrait of Casey, nevertheless, is an intimate and credible sketch 
of a neurotic artist. Casey returns to New York confused, but creatively 
reinvigorated, concluding that she can only realize her fantasies in her music: 
"The best affair is the affair you don't have . . . except in your songs."

MEMORIES OF A CHINESE-AMERICAN BOYHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
THE CHINAMAN PACIFIC &amp; FRISCO R.R. CO. BY FRANK CHIN (COFFEE HOUSE PRESS: 
$9.95; 184 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Douglas Sun, Sun, a Chinese-American graduate student at the University of 
Chicago, is seeking a publisher for his first novel.

<TEXT>
<P>
When I think of some friends of mine from the old neighborhood (all of whom had 
the proper ethnic credentials, let me assure you), one thing I remember is our 
wariness of what we called "I Have a Problem" literature. By that, we meant 
literature of ethnic experience at its most tiresome: brooding, Angst-ridden 
story-polemics, crammed to the gills with resentment and righteous anger, about 
existential misery in the Land of the Round-Eye; literature that seemed to 
assume that any bit of drivel was worth your attention just as long as it had a 
chip on its shoulder. It's a species related to what Calvin Trillin called the 
"kvetch novel" -- any novel in which you want to say to the main character, 
"Oh, just pull up your socks" -- only more irritating. But it's also an easy 
trap for anyone who writes from an ethnocentric point of view to fall into. It 
is, therefore, to Frank Chin's credit that his collection of short stories, 
"The Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco R.R. Co." by and large avoids this trap even 
as it dances on the edge of the pit. 
</P>
<P>
There are eight stories in this volume, most of them autobiographical in tone. 
Almost all have as their essential subject the alienation of Chinese-America 
from the America of white skin and Wonder Bread. The first two, "Railroad 
Standard Time" and "The Eat and Run Midnight People," read like meandering 
stream-of-consciousness memoirs and are self-indulgent enough to make them the 
weakest of the bunch. The final story, "The Sons of Chan," clothes itself in 
shreds of fiction with some interesting Freudian overtones, but it is otherwise 
a tiring screed on growing up with the stereotypes in Charlie Chan movies as 
your only reflection in popular culture. Chin's rhetoric is often sharp and 
funny, but he also rides the high horse of racial bitterness for more than it's 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
It's the other five stories that distinguish "The Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco 
R.R. Co." In them, Chin displays two considerable writerly virtues. One is a 
wicked sense of humor that runs a provocative gamut from jangled whimsy to 
scathing satire. His subject matter is weighty enough so that an amusing 
conceit or figuration often balances out the mood. This is particularly true of 
"A Chinese Lady Dies," in which the narrator's problematic (and disturbingly 
Oedipal) relationship with his mother evokes such tension that the story would 
self-immolate without the whimsical dream passages in which he imagines himself 
as an Old-Western hero called E. Chino. His wit feels more like a dagger than a 
feather, but is no less amusing for it. And for good measure, Chin tacks on an 
afterword that reads suspiciously like a freewheeling satire on Maxine Hong 
Kingston's "The Woman Warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 His other primary virtue is his considerable skill as a storyteller. He has a 
genuine gift for bringing characters and their predicaments alive. One sees 
this most vividly in "The Only Real Day," which focuses on the struggle of an 
aged immigrant to keep American culture at bay and preserve his identity as a 
Chinese. Chin has a definite point to make in this story about the corrosion of 
Chinese values and identity in a mostly white world, but the message is 
filtered so thoroughly through the plot and well-drawn characters that it has 
no didactic harshness. It is, above all, a poignant and entrancing piece of 
fiction. "Yes, Young Daddy," which depicts the protagonist's relationship with 
a female cousin who is grappling with adolescence, is also worth noting for its 
skillful portraiture. 
</P>
<P>
Chin's prose style tends toward a looseness vaguely reminiscent of William S. 
Burroughs. It's lively stuff but also slow going at times, what with the 
missing antecedents, plastic sentence structure and all. He also enjoys playing 
fast and loose with temporal shifts in his stories, with the result that 
memory, present experience, anticipation and pure fantasy often overlap. It's 
an absorbingly dense reflection of the way in which past, present and future 
come to bear upon each other in the mind, but everything melds so seamlessly 
that the reader may have some trouble keeping things sorted. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Chin does a good job of avoiding the hazards that could have 
swallowed up these stories. Although alienation is the great theme of 
post-World War II American literature and our age is distinguished by its 
voices from outside the mainstream, just because a work is about racial 
alienation doesn't automatically make it worth reading. The problem with 
ethnocentric literature is that its force is so centripetal. It tends to reach 
inward, instead of outward toward the universal significance that, as Northrop 
Frye said, marks literature in its highest form. Fiction need not reach that 
level to be worth our while, but it should at least show a human dimension that 
will move us and provoke us, as mere formalized pique cannot. Fortunately, "The 
Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco R.R. Co." achieves such transcendance often 
enough to make it worthwhile fiction.

<P>
The Sunday evening movie lineup is one of the strongest in memory, commencing 
at 6 p.m. on Channel 5 with Mel Brooks' hilarious 1974 horror picture spoof, 
Young Frankenstein, with Gene Wilder heading a terrific cast. 
</P>
<P>
Chariots of Fire (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), the 1981 multi-Oscar winner, 
traces the parallel lives of two very different athletes who became part of the 
remarkable British track and field team at the 1924 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Silent Victory: The Kitty O'Neil Story (Channel 9 Sunday at 7 p.m.) is an 
exceptionally well-made 1979 TV movie with Stockard Channing starring in this 
real-life story about a deaf woman who became one of Hollywood's top stunt 
women. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Mel Brooks' 1968 debut film The Producers (Channel 5 Sunday at 8 
p.m.) is even funnier than "Young Frankenstein." It's a zany farce in which 
Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder come up with a cockamamie scheme to profit from 
staging a terrible play. 
</P>
<P>
The 1972 Frenzy (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is the finest of Alfred 
Hitchcock's last films, a thriller set in his native London and dealing with a 
man (Jon Finch) wrongly accused of being a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
The Karen Carpenter Story (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) stars Cynthia Gibb in the 
title role of this new TV movie about the popular singer who died at 32 from 
the affects of anorexia nervosa. Mitchell Anderson plays Carpenter's brother 
and singing partner Richard. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Gremlins (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful 
Life" turned inside out, upside down and pickled in brine, a sweet-and-sour 
comedy featuring an invasion of a small Middle American town by a horde of 
fast-multiplying, deceptively cute, furry creatures. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th James Bond adventure A View to a Kill (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a 
so-so affair, with Roger Moore beginning to look a little weary as 007 (Timothy 
Dalton would replace him in the next Bond, the 1987 "Living Daylights"). This 
time the villain is Christopher Walken, intent on destroying Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Terry Gilliam's 1985 Brazil (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), an 
exploding cigar in the face of the future, is like watching Gilliam's head 
erupt in public. Everything that has ever made an impact on the film maker 
seems to be whirling by in this brilliant, exhausting, savagely funny 
post-Orwellian satire, set in the gray confines of the Ministry of Information 
where his shiningly innocent hero (Jonathan Pryce) toils in his cherished 
anonymity. Gilliam's targets are the usual Monty Python concerns: modern 
technology and the men who run it, terrorists, repairmen, bureaucrats, the 
plastic surgery industry, the ad game and sticklers for detail, wherever they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
Terror on Highway 91 (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, stars Ricky 
Schroder in the true story of a young man who exposes police corruption in a 
small southern town. George Dzundza and Matt Clark co-star. 
</P>
<P>
Blake Edwards' 1979 10 (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 10 
p.m.), a modern comedy classic, stars Dudley Moore as a popular composer who, 
in the clutch of middle age, pursues a beautiful young bride (Bo Derek) all the 
way to Mexico, where she is honeymooning. This is a superbly constructed film 
which makes shrewd observations of the American obsession with sex and youth, 
California-style. 
</P>
<P>
The Man in the Brown Suit (CBS Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie updating 
Agatha Christie's 1924 mystery novel about a young American woman (Stephanie 
Zimbalist) traveling through Egypt in search of adventure. Rue McClanahan, Tony 
Randall and Edward Woodward star. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Reiner's 1984 This Is Spinal Tap (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.) is one 
of the funniest movies of the decade, a delicious sendup on the making of a 
rock documentary in which Reiner casts himself as a film maker trying to make a 
record of a seedy English group on tour. The line between parody and reality 
becomes exceedingly and riotously thin. 
</P>
<P>
The dreadful 1986 comedy Armed and Dangerous (CBS Saturday at 8 p.m.) plays 
like a third-generation dupe print of "Police Academy," with frantic splices 
from "Beverly Hills Cop." John Candy and Eugene Levy star as a pair of goofy 
misfits adrift in a Los Angeles populated entirely by bozos, nitwits, boobs and 
cads. 
</P>
<P>
Brian De Palma's 1983 remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster classic Scarface 
(ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) moves the action from Chicago in the '20s to Miami's 
Cuban community of the present, but for all its operatic razzle-dazzle, it 
becomes a lurid exercise in wretched excess. Al Pacino has the title role as a 
doomed drug kingpin.

PICTURING MANZANAR; 
</P>
<P>
MANZANAR BY JOHN ARMOUR AND PETER WRIGHT PHOTOGRAPHS BY ANSEL ADAMS, COMMENTARY 
BY JOHN HERSEY (TIMES BOOKS: $27.50; 167 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Kishiyama , Kishiyama, a Calendar assistant editor, was born in the 
Heart Mountain, Wyo., relocation camp. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There could not be a more powerful combination than words by John Hersey and 
photographs by Ansel Adams. When the subject matter is "Manzanar" and the 
unconstitutional imprisoning of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the 
combination would seem to be explosive -- and is. 
</P>
<P>
Eloquent and moving, Hersey's 15,000-word essay details how this tragedy came 
into being: "The bitterest national shame of the Second World War for the sweet 
land of liberty: the mass incarceration, on racial grounds alone, on false 
evidence of military necessity, and in contempt of their supposedly inalienable 
rights, of an entire class of American citizens -- along with others who were 
not citizens in the country of their choice only because that country had long 
denied people of their race the right to naturalize." 
</P>
<P>
Equally moving are Adams' photographs, originally taken to document life in 
Manzanar, just a speck on the map in Inyo County in the rugged eastern Sierra 
before it became one of 10 camps established to hold about 120,000 
Japanese-Americans from 1942 to 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Hersey's contribution occupies only the first 66 pages. Worse, 
Adams' pictures have been culled to less than half of the 204 pictures he 
donated to the Library of Congress. Many of these historic photographs are 
reproduced at sizes much smaller than snapshots developed in a hour at your 
corner photo shop. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of letting Hersey and Adams' words and pictures tell the story, the 
book dilutes the saga and turns it into another stereotypical tale of 
Japanese-Americana: how we overcame hardship and made the best of a bad 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
The titles of the three different contributions to the book indicate three 
different approaches: outrage in Hersey's "A Mistake of Terrifically Horrible 
Proportions," irony in Adams' "Born Free and Equal" and the bland in Armour and 
Wright's "A Portrait of Manzanar." 
</P>
<P>
Now that a redress bill has been passed by Congress and signed by the 
President, which would grant every living internee $20,000, the horrifying 
mistake of nearly 50 years ago has been officially rectified. But not the 
lasting impression that what the government did was wrong. For chipping away at 
this stone wall the book's authors and publisher have to be congratulated. 
</P>
<P>
But how much better it would have been for the book to at least mention that 
Ansel Adams' Manzanar photos, when put on display after 40 years, were 
criticized by some Japanese-Americans as "prettifying" the harsh camp 
experience. Or that many of those photographed carry hidden pyschological scars 
from the war fought within. Or that most of those photographed have long since 
died, never qualifying for the $20,000 and carrying to their graves the thought 
that they were "guilty" as never charged.

Set in Australia at the turn of the 20th Century, "Waiting for Childhood" is 
the story of seven children left to cope for themselves after their parents 
die. Their father, The Rev. William Lord, expires at the breakfast table one 
morning. After the family leaves for a ramshackle house owned by a wealthy 
cousin, the mother loses her mind and then her life in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest daughter, Lily, takes charge of the entire household, as Jess 
becomes a favorite of her rich cousin Jackie and watches her rival for Jackie's 
affections fall fatally from a mountaintop. 
</P>
<P>
These characters, "all talented, all deeply human, (are) all so beautifully 
realized that by the end of the novel we identify with them to the point of 
heartbreak," Carolyn See wrote in these pages. " 'Waiting for Childhood' 
manages to be at once terribly melancholy and extraordinarily exhilarating."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: LEAVING HOME BY GARRISON KEILLOR (PENGUIN BOOKS: $4.95)

Penguin Books has here collected 36 of the host of "A Prairie Home Companion's" 
radio monologues, each beginning with the words "it has been a quiet week in 
Lake Wobegon" -- a town "where all the women are strong, the men are 
good-looking, and all the children are above average." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have been charmed by Keillor's wistful American pastoral will be 
pleased to learn, as Dan Sullivan put it in his review, that "Keillor doesn't 
ramble as much in type as he did on the air. Something else does come across 
better on the page: the realization that Lake Wobegon does not exist. . . . 
Every now and then, the whole town starts to waver, like a mirage, and you see 
Keillor . . . wondering whether to send a character into her house to discover 
the mess that her kids have made, or to let her take a walk around the block 
first."

On May 10, 1896, acting on a report by French engineer Victor Prompt that the 
headwaters of the Nile could be dammed up, "turning the great waterway on and 
off like a bathtub spigot," Capt. Jean-Baptiste Marchand sails from Marseilles 
to the French Congo and begins his trek across Africa to the Nile with 150-odd 
Senegalese soldiers. They arrive in Fashoda in July, 1898. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the British launch an Anglo-Egyptian army of 30,000 men under 
the leadership of Herbert Kitchener. These men build a railroad across the 
desert, meet up with another 60,000-man army and arrive in Fashoda in 
September, 1898. 
</P>
<P>
"On September 19, Marchand and Kitchener exchanged champagne toasts aboard a 
British gunboat anchored off Fashoda before politely threatening to destroy 
each other," David Levering Lewis writes in this absorbing history. "On 
November 4, Paris ordered recently promoted Major Marchand to abandon his 
fortress." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing from the archives of African states, from newly translated political 
correspondence as well as memoirs, Lewis exposes the sometimes absurd imperial 
energies of European states and the emerging role of African nations.

Negotiations are under way for Dustin Hoffman to play the title role in 
Warners' on-again, off-again "Phantom" -- the opera story updated to 
Nazi-occupied Germany. Originally at Lorimar, the script's recently been 
revamped by James Dearden ("Fatal Attraction"), with filming to begin in April. 
Wolfgang Petersen directs and co-produces with C.O. Erickson. . . . Family 
ties: Actor-producer James Keach makes his directorial debut with "The 
Forgotten," the story of Vietnam MIAs released after 17 years' imprisonment. 
But a sinister plot develops when the soldiers are debriefed in Berlin. It 
stars Keith Carradine, Stacy Keach and Steve Railsback, who 
co-wrote/co-produces with Keach, James. Mimi Maynard and Sandra Will, 
respectively the wives of James Keach and Carradine, also have roles. 
Production starts late January for Paramount. . . . 
</P>

Emily Lloyd will star in "Letters for Iris," the story of a young woman who 
becomes a nanny as a means to avenge a terrible wrong. Israel Horvitz wrote the 
yarn, which films late spring in Boston, for producer Robert Lawrence. Burt 
Young joins Joseph Mantegna and Faye Dunaway in Zoetrope's "Wait Until Spring, 
Bandini," filming in Utah next February. Fred Roos, Erwin Provoost and Tom 
Luddy produce the story of immigrant life in the 1920s. Dominique Deruddere is 
writer-director. Tom Waits will score. . . .

Trueheart, who is yet to be cast.

Rodriguez's interview with corporate attorney Elsa Banuelos was dismaying. 
Banuelos states that she is "tired of translating" when called upon by client 
or other attorneys to assist them with the busboys. Would Banuelos feel just as 
tired, or rather, embarrassed, to translate while negotiating a contract with 
another attorney or a Spanish-speaking client? I think not. It is unfortunate 
that Banuelos is not proud of her ability to converse in Spanish, even if it is 
only used to ask the busboy for another glass of water.

Leo Estrada's suggested model of middle-class Mexican-Americans creating 
country clubs for ourselves so as to pass on our advantages to our young is 
probably unnecessary. Instead, the Latino professionals profiled in the article 
could directly benefit the next Mexican-American generation by teaching them 
their skills. For example, the Cal Poly Pomona campus (where I teach) boasts 
14% Latino students, and its School of Business Administration, with the 
largest number of declared majors on campus who are Latino and black, regularly 
hires practicing financial consultants and lawyers on a visiting, part-time 
basis. Although the money isn't great, sweet satisfactions can derive from 
having a Latino student earn the top grade on a corporate finance exam (as just 
happened to me) or from submitting a proposal to the National Science 
Foundation to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site where 
students may, under my guidance, undertake a yearlong study of attitudes and 
experiences of Latino MBAs in U.S. corporations.

The articles on Gaddi Vasquez ("Gaddi Vasquez: On the Republican Fast Track,"

time for a change in stereotypical attitudes toward Hispanics. We have a large 
middle class that people seem to ignore.

ART NEWS: AN EXHIBIT WHOSE TIME HAS COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phyllis Plous admits that six years is a long time to put together any exhibit. 
Her timing seems auspicious, however. When the curator began organizing a show 
of abstract painting in 1982, in her words, the art form was "relegated to the 
dust bins." Today, as "Abstract Options" is about to open, that is all changed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a definite acceleration of interest in abstraction since the 
mid-'80s," said Plous, who with Frances Colpitt co-curated the 32-painting 
exhibit, opening Friday at UC Santa Barbara's University Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The project began when Colpitt, a critic and art historian, arrived at UCSB to 
teach, said Plous, University Art Museum curator. "Neo Expressionism was so 
rampant at the time and we began to wonder why we only saw Abstract art in 
artists' studios." 
</P>
<P>
Ten contemporary artists from the east and west coasts are represented in the 
show. The co-curators chose artists that differed in their treatment of surface 
and form, but shared a preference for a lush richness. 
</P>
<P>
"The show perhaps is about sensuality and the process of painting," Plous said. 
"Unlike Neo-Geo, this is not dry illustrative abstraction. I don't like the 
word pretty very much, but I think it's going to be a beautiful show." 
</P>
<P>
Artists in the exhibit are Edith Baumann-Hudson, Moira Dryer, Heidi Gluck, 
Nancy Haynes, James Hayward, Mary Heilmann, Julian Lethbridge, John M. Miller, 
Paul Mogensen and Stephen Westfall. It is scheduled to run in Santa Barbara 
through Feb. 26, then travel to Evanston, Ill., and Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
RETIRING: Artist La Monte Westmoreland, who established Los Angeles' most 
active high school-based gallery, will retire this month to concentrate on his 
own artwork after 10 years as director of Roberts Art Gallery at Santa Monica 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I just need to have more studio time," Westmoreland said, now making mostly 
mixed-media collages shown at Lizardi/Harp Gallery in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Lita Albuquerque, John Swihart, Laddie John Dill, Guy Dill and Sandra Mendelson 
Rubin lead an illustrious list of local artists, many of them alumni of the 
high school, who regularly took part in Westmoreland's exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica-based artist Peter Alexander, who for several years donated works 
for annual auctions to support the gallery, lauded Westmoreland's efforts that 
he said turned the space, founded in 1935, into a unique showcase for local 
emerging and established artists that particularly benefited the high school's 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole deal was La Monte's doing," said Alexander, one of this city's 
best-known painters whose two daughters went to Santa Monica High School. "His 
enthusiasm, in terms of bringing work to the students, has been quite 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Goodwin, a painting instructor at the high school, will succeed 
Westmoreland, whose final exhibit, "Paintings and Sculptures," Jan. 5 through 
Jan. 26, features eight artists. (See art openings for details.) 
</P>
<P>
LACE GRANTS: Local interdisciplinary artists developing new work may apply for 
grants from Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), now in the fourth year 
of its Grant Program for Interdisciplinary Artists. More than $30,200 are 
available for individuals or groups of artists working collaboratively. For 
information and an application, call LACE at (213) 624-5650. June Scott heads 
up the program. 
</P>
<P>
IN PUBLIC: Public art and its preservation, issues of increasing concern 
nationwide, are the theme of a new publication. "Going Public: A Field Guide to 
Developments in Art in Public Places" was produced with the input of 30 
nationally recognized artists, public art administrators, design professionals 
and others brought together by the National Endowment for the Arts to examine 
public art issues. For information, contact the Arts Education Service at the 
University of Massachusetts, (413) 545-2360.

RESTAURANT NOTEBOOK: FLOCKING TOGETHER AND CHICKENING OUT

Chicken is chicken, right? Well, not always, it appears. A new catalogue of 
chicken-based products available from Pierce Foods -- a leading supplier of 
pre-cooked menu items to the food service industry -- offers well over 200 
variations on the theme. There's Hume Dingher's 39 Seasonings Fast-Fry chicken, 
for instance ("Leave it to Hume to pack 39 herbs and spices, sea salts, and 
vegetables into one chicken recipe"). Or Greek Odyssey Chicken Breast Fillets 
("IT'S MICROWAVEABLE!"). Or Marinata Americana Chicken Thigh Fillets ("Here is 
a chicken fillet with a touch of greatness -- a lighter blend of those Central 
and Southern European spices America loves best"). 
</P>
<P>
Other varieties of Pierce poulet include Marinata/LS (Low Sodium) Curried Brest 
(sic), Microwaveable Wing-Dings, Roman-Fingers, Dip'n Chik'n Nuggets, Taste 
O'Mesquite Whole Halves (sic), Chik-Nachos and both Whirligigs and Whirlibirds 
(the latter, of course, being "Fully cooked, breaded chicken breast-and-thigh 
meat patties . . . seasoned with sage and onion croutons"). 
</P>
<P>
It's nice to know that somebody like Pierce is out there making the 
restaurateur's life easier, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
READ MY LICKS: What will (gulp) President Bush and Vice-President Quayle be 
eating on the evening of Inauguration Day? Hearts-of-palm blossoms, 
asiago-garlic bread and pheasant pizza, among other things. They'll be sampling 
these and other exotic delicacies at a reception in a new restaurant in the 
nation's capital called Adirondacks. Adirondacks, which is the work of L.A.'s 
own Michael McCarty (of Michael's in Santa Monica) and chef Jimmy Schmidt -- 
who also own the Rattlesnake Clubs in Denver and Detroit -- is an appropriate 
site for a presidential reception, as it happens, since it occupies the old 
presidential suite at Washington's Union Station, built for the use of Teddy 
Roosevelt. (Adirondacks was originally going to be yet another Rattlesnake 
Club, incidentally, but McCarty and Schmidt felt that an East-coast sort of 
name would be more appropriate. Personally, I think the Rattlesnake Club is a 
great name for a restaurant a few blocks from Capitol Hill.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to serve wild hors d'oeuvres," says Schmidt. "You know those 
politician types. They like to stay on their feet and pump a lot of hands. 
They'll probably be so busy talking that they'll only take little bites of 
things -- so I've got to get my licks in quick." 
</P>
<P>
Among those licks will be spicy shrimp with achiote and picaya (hearts-of-palm 
blossoms) on lemon-bread croutons, asiago-garlic bread with black and green 
olive tapenade, and that pheasant pizza with the addition of Chinese-style plum 
sauce, hot mustard and mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, wait a minute. Isn't Bush the guy who made fun of Michael Dukakis for 
talking about Belgian endive? 
</P>
<P>
SALT AND PEPPER: Cafe Prego is new on La Cienega, on the site of the former 
L'Angolo (among other restaurants). . . . Marc Ehrler, former chef for the 
French ambassador in Washington, is the new executive chef at the San Ysidro 
Ranch in Montecito. Ehrler replaces Bryan Carr, who has moved to the El Encanto 
Hotel in Santa Barbara. . . .

I find it very disappointing that The Times would refer to someone as 
close-minded and ridiculous as Tracey Ullman as a "tastemaker" (Taste Makers, 
Dec. 25). 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who lives, (and very well I might add!) in this city and feels that 
theater here does not merit her very valuable time has not looked very far. I'm 
sure that Ms. Ullman could find something to satisfy her superior taste. 
</P>
<P>
If she finds Los Angeles and this country in fact to be a cultural or artistic 
desert, then perhaps she should move back to London and have her tea there, or 
would that hit here where it hurts, her pocketbook!

STENCILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUDDENLY POPULAR after nearly a century of neglect, stencil painting now 
decorates nursery walls and furniture, living and dining room walls and floors. 
Stenciling became prominent in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it 
was used to imitate wallpaper. In the American colonies, stenciled designs were 
used on floors, on furniture and on canvas or oilcloth floor coverings. 
</P>
<P>
The process is simple: A stenciler, using a craft knife, cuts various shapes in 
a piece of sturdy, usually waxed, paper, and then applies paint to a surface 
through those cutouts. The beauty of stenciling is the ease of repetition: 
Complicated swag-and-bouquet borders can be applied to walls in a fraction of 
the time (and without the requisite talent) it would take someone to paint them 
by hand. Stenciling can be a very satisfying craft, because the end result, 
when done well, looks professionally neat and precise. 
</P>
<P>
Although stenciling is easy enough to attempt on your own -- with just some 
paper, a craft knife, paint and brushes -- a small test project before 
launching into a total-room experience is a good idea. The hardest thing to 
master is the correct consistency of the paint. Think dry. And the stencil 
brush (shaped like a blunt, long-handled shaving brush) should be wielded with 
an up-and-down motion; wiping brings disaster. The surface to be stenciled 
determines the consistency of the paint; cloth can take more paint on the 
brush, but a floor previously painted with something like diamond-hard deck 
enamel will resist all paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Many how-to books on stenciling have been published; Dover Books has issued a 
series of books of stencil designs on thick paper, ready for cutting. 
Stenciling supplies and classes are offered at Judy's Carousel Crafts and 
Rainbow Craft, both in Burbank, and at Craf-T-Mac's in La Habra. Supplies are 
available at Aaron Bros. stores, Kit Kraft in Studio City, Stat's in Pasadena, 
and Michael's in Torrance. UCLA Extension plans to offer a stenciling class in 
the spring quarter.

DAT AND LUDDITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding John C. Dvorak's Dec. 11 Viewpoints column, "Why DAT Isn't 
Un-American": 
</P>
<P>
I must agree with Dvorak. It is not digital audio tape that is un-American, but 
rather the Recording Industry Assn. of America itself. 
</P>
<P>
The attitudes and actions of the RIAA very closely parallel those of the 
Luddites, the early 19th-Century English workmen who destroyed labor-saving 
machinery to "protect" the economy. The Luddites could not see that if textiles 
could be more easily manufactured and sold for less, more people could afford 
more of them. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way, the RIAA was wrong about standard audio cassettes, wrong about 
videocassette recorders and now also wrong about DAT. Audio cassettes boosted 
sales of long-playing records, and VCRs boosted motion picture revenues. The 
RIAA would like to punish the entire country for the supposed wrongs of the 
proverbial bootlegging pirates. This is not only unfair but ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
The RIAA's special-interest politicking may have hurt the introduction of DAT, 
but it won't be able to stop read/write compact discs. Everything seems to be 
going digital. It's just a matter of time.

'89 WISH LIST: PROTECTION, TAXES AND PEACE; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL BENEFITS, DEFICIT REDUCTION ARE TOP PRIORITIES FOR THE NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What changes would you like to see in business practices and the workplace this 
year? How can business leaders and economic policy-makers improve the economy 
and the world in general in 1989? The Times ran these questions by people in 
various walks of life, and here are some of their answers: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Muriel Siebert, head of the Muriel Siebert &amp; Co. discount brokerage in New 
York, and first female member of the New York Stock Exchange: 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see certain business practices regulated. I think that the 
leveraged buyouts show the greed of people at their worst. . . . The LBOs are 
bypassing the purpose of the capital-raising system. I think that to the extent 
that people were stockholders in these companies . . . they should be allowed 
to continue to have some kind of share in the profits (after the leveraged 
buyouts) because these moves were done while they were stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
"Must greed be the creed? I would like to see that also rolled over to our 
defense contractors. I am pro defense. I believe in a strong country because 
people mistake gentility for weakness. If (contractors) cheat on defense 
contracts, I don't see why they don't go to jail. . . . I just feel that if you 
are a major defense contractor, you owe a fiduciary responsibility to this 
country because defense expenditures are putting a pretty big toll on the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Brimmer, former member of the Federal Reserve Board and head of a 
Washington economics consulting firm: 
</P>
<P>
"My leading wish is that the nation deal with the federal budget deficit. I 
would like to see a substantial reduction in 1989 and extending over the next 
three years. I would strongly recommend that we raise taxes. There should be 
some moderation in the level of government expenditures, but the real problem 
is the lag in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I also would like to see more done for education by business. The kind of 
education I'm talking about is at the elementary and secondary level. 
Businesses are already contributing to colleges. Businesses should do likewise 
for elementary and secondary schools. Business people can play a role as 
counselors and teachers. A firm might make available an engineer or 
mathematician to go into schools and teach. Business should do more to offer 
on-the-job training for unskilled, or limited-skills, people, perhaps through a 
(lower) learning wage. We would give business tax credits to do this." 
</P>
<P>
William R. Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation 
of Labor, AFL-CIO: 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see a change in philosophy by the incoming President relating 
to labor relations and providing for fairness in our (labor) organizing efforts 
and contract negotiations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to see some protection for workers losing their jobs because 
of mergers. It is a national disgrace. In too many mergers, the workers are the 
ones that suffer and the country as well. Something should be done to correct 
it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And, finally, this Administration should face reality in resolving the 
astronomical deficit." 
</P>
<P>
Steven D. Lydenberg, an associate with the "socially responsible" investment 
firm of Franklin Research &amp; Development: 
</P>
<P>
"There is an increasing interest around the country in social investing. People 
want to know not just the financial implications of making a commitment in a 
company, but also the social implication. That information is not very easy to 
come by. 
</P>
<P>
"So, if at the end of '89 corporations were disclosing in a uniform way their 
yield figures, their charitable contribution figures, the numbers of women and 
minorities in top management and board directors, their attitude on a number of 
comparable social issues, I would be very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Borman, chairman of Patlex Corp. of Chatsworth, former astronaut and 
former chairman of Eastern Airlines: 
</P>
<P>
"We should begin to move toward taxing consumption -- a value-added tax. This 
is quite controversial as Al Ullman (Oregon Democrat and former chairman of the 
House Ways and Means Committee, who was defeated in 1988 after advocating a 
value-added tax) will tell you. But this taxing system is needed. It would 
certainly help our exports. Almost all of Europe is under the value-added 
taxing system. Also, it may encourage saving instead of consumption. One of the 
ways you discourage consumption is to tax it." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Harrington, co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America and author of 
"The Other America" and "The New American Poverty": 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Secretary of State Baker will build on the basic insights of former 
Treasury Secretary Baker (James Baker, former treasury secretary, was nominated 
by President-elect Bush to be Secretary of State) that a settlement of Third 
World debt is in the self-interest of America, opening up markets for business 
and labor. But then the new Baker will have to go far beyond the old, since 
Latin America now owes more than it did in 1982 when the crisis officially 
began, and several countries, including Argentina and Brazil, may see democracy 
subverted if current trends persist. 
</P>
<P>
"At home, the nation must recognize that we can't waste young people, and 
particularly minorities and women, on illiteracy, unemployment and unproductive 
low-wage work. We must invest mightily in education, training and job 
generation." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Bromberg, a securities law expert and professor at Southern Methodist 
University: 
</P>
<P>
"There are several things I would like most to see changed in the economy and 
business practices. One, more concentration by business and government, both 
here and abroad, on . . . the facilitation of international trade and 
investment. This would require wider horizons for business people . . . and 
more effort by government to reduce and ultimately eliminate all kinds of 
restrictions on the movement of products. 
</P>
<P>
"Two, I would like to see a national consensus developed, preferably in the 
form of federal legislation, on corporate takeovers and buyouts that would 
recognize the efficiencies and benefits they bring as well as the dislocations 
and hardships they can cause. This would involve tax policies and labor polices 
and limitations on the ability of states to Balkanize corporate law by 
different anti-takeover statutes everywhere. (There also should be) some kind 
of limitation on management self-entrenchment and self-enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could use a lot of clarification of the securities laws. I think 
the courts have done a good job of saying what insider trading is. The kind of 
issues that are most difficult are what really is parking (of stock)? How much 
cooperation or similar action by different individuals or different groups of 
individuals makes it collaboration? These issues haven't been well resolved. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace in Washington: 
</P>
<P>
"People now view threats to human security less in terms of political threats 
and more in environmental and economic terms. So for my wish list, I would ask 
first that we deal with the issue of the greenhouse effect. We better develop 
some alternative views in mass transportation and cut subsidies to reflect the 
true cost of fossil fuels in terms of pollution, along with the actual economic 
cost of development. Then, we could put more money into research and 
development of wind and solar energy. 
</P>
<P>
"(Also on my wish list is) peace on earth. If we want peace on earth, we have 
to start looking seriously at the fact that we are making more and more 
weapons, and in a process which endangers the health of American people. . . . 
Production plants have been proven to have released into the air and water 
radioactivity and toxic chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
"Also, it would be nice if we could learn that the rain forest affects all of 
us. We need to preserve it. And we would like the tuna industry to stop killing 
dolphins."

MEDIAN HOME PRICES, SALES UP IN NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Median prices and sales of resale detached houses and condominiums rose in 
November, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
November sales of detached houses in California rose 4.9% over October, thanks 
to a brief dip in interest rates and strong demand. 
</P>
<P>
Detached houses sold at an annual rate of 597,000 in November compared to 
569,330 in October. The November figure was 17% higher than last November 
making it the highest in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The state's median sales price for resale houses rose 1.2% in November to 
$177,485. This was a 23.6% jump from November, 1987, when the median was 
$143,554. Joel Singer, chief economist of the realtors' group, said lack of 
inventory helped to cause the price rise. 
</P>
<P>
Condominium resales rose 0.2% over October but 48.4% over November, 1987. The 
median condominium price fell 2.7%, to $126,328 in November from $129,869 in 
October. Even so, November's median price was 10.4% higher than a year ago, 
when it was $114,457.

INTERIOR DESIGN IMPORTANT TO VISUALLY IMPAIRED PERSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interior design can have more impact on the visually impaired than on those who 
see normally, according Jean Bast of the San Diego chapter of the American 
Society of Interior Designers. 
</P>
<P>
Chapter members have been volunteering their services to redesigning and 
renovating the San Diego Service Center for the Blind, using techniques and 
design applications that will transform it into an integrated "way-finding" 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Most furnishings are also being donated to the $500,000 renovation of the 
8,000-square-foot center. Design applications will include the use of brightly 
colored accents on walls and floors, improved overhead lighting to reduce 
glare, lighting in handrails and heavily textured walls, said Jan Bast, the 
chairman of the ASID design team. 
</P>
<P>
"To call this a center for the blind is somewhat a misnomer, since most of the 
people utilizing the center are partially sighted," Bast added. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80% of the 2,200 people using the San Diego facility are elderly, and 
design efforts have also gone into special furnishings for that group. For the 
totally blind, different, heavily textured wall coverings and varying floor 
surfaces will enhance their ability to find their way.

THE BUSH YEARS: 1;

<P>
PAYING FOR THE REAGAN REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By William Schneider, William Schneider is a contributing editor to Opinion.

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two predictions for 1989: There isn't going to be a Bush Revolution. But George 
Bush will have to pay the price for the Reagan Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
We know there won't be a Bush Revolution because, with one exception, none of 
the people Bush has appointed to policy-making positions is a revolutionary. 
They are in the mold of Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III, who 
was reviled by conservatives when he was Ronald Reagan's chief of staff; Atty. 
Gen. Richard Thornburgh, who has served in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan 
administrations; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who is closer to Wall 
Street than to the supply-siders on the Republican right, and Brent Scowcroft, 
Bush's national security adviser, who is known to harbor serious doubts about 
Reagan's "Star Wars" program. In other words, Bush has assembled a team of 
cautious, moderate, pragmatic, Establishment Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The one exception is Jack Kemp, Bush's proposed secretary of housing and urban 
development. Kemp has never held an executive position before, and he is 
brimming over with radical new ideas. Kemp's is regarded as a token appointment 
to a secondary Cabinet position, however, made to mollify the GOP's right wing. 
(Quiz: Who is Reagan's secretary of housing and urban development? Hint: He is 
the only Cabinet member who served for Reagan's entire two terms. Give up? 
Here's another hint: He is the only black in Reagan's Cabinet. Still stumped? 
The answer is Samuel R. Pierce Jr. If you didn't know, don't worry. Reagan 
himself didn't recognize Pierce at a White House reception several years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
Actually, radical new ideas are what is needed for dealing with the major 
problem under Kemp's purview, namely, the national scandal of homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Kemp, the only controversial appointments Bush has made were to 
political rather than policy-making positions -- John H. Sununu as White House 
chief of staff, Lee Atwater as Republican Party chairman and Dan Quayle as vice 
president. None has to be confirmed by the Senate. And the Bush people are 
still trying to figure out something for Quayle to do. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, when it comes to policy positions, there are no James P. Watts, no 
William J. Caseys, no Edwin Meese IIIs, no William J. Bennetts. The Reagan 
Administration gave us bold new ideas. The Bush Administration will give us 
something we rarely got from Reagan -- professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
Congress seems impressed by Bush's professionalism. Even Democrats express 
admiration for the professionalism of his presidential campaign. "It was a 
nasty campaign," said House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced), "but 
basically it was a professional campaign. They knew what had to be done and 
they did it." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, we are in one of the rare periods of make-nice in Washington. Bush's 
efforts to bind up the wounds of the campaign are paying off. He has bought 
himself a honeymoon. Conservatives are holding their fire; they don't want to 
be seen as abandoning the new President before he even takes office. The press 
is happy because the President-elect has held more press conferences this year 
than the President. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and Bush are engaged in an elaborate Alphonse-and-Gaston routine. Each 
side expresses great admiration for the other. One says, "Oh please, you be the 
first to reveal your budget plans." "Oh no, I couldn't possibly," says the 
other. "Please, you go first." As in the court of the Sun King at Versailles, 
the ritual courtesy masks a deadly clash of ambitions. Each side wants to seize 
the dagger and drive it into the other's heart. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes are the dagger. He who proposes new taxes gets it in the neck. As Sen. 
John Breaux (D-La.), the new chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
Committee, put it, "Bush is the one who laid down the gauntlet -- read my lips, 
no new taxes. If we go out and break his promise for him, we get the blame for 
it and he gets the credit. No one wants to fall into that trap." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, as soon as the deficit comes up, the honeymoon ends. It will be 
hard for Bush to do what Reagan has done for the last eight years, namely, 
pretend the deficit is not his problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will also pay the price for Reagan's foreign policy. In this case, a break 
with the Republican right is inevitable. The right always resented the fact 
that Reagan abandoned his "evil empire" agenda in order to pursue arms control 
and detente. They dared not protest, however. "Reagan could always go over our 
heads to our own people at the grass roots," said conservative activist Paul 
Weyrich. "Bush won't be able to do that. He needs us." Bush and Scowcroft do 
not show much enthusiasm for "Star Wars." Bush and Baker have decided to 
postpone asking Congress for new military aid to the Contras. The Reagan 
Administration, with Bush's full support, has begun talking to the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. Some time this year, conservatives are going to say, 
"Enough!" 
</P>
<P>
Bush will also pay the price for Reagan's social agenda. Here the break will be 
not with Congress or the GOP right, but with the American public. It will 
happen as soon as the Supreme Court reverses its historic 1973 Roe vs. Wade 
decision that defined abortion as a constitutionally protected human right. 
Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who wrote Roe vs. Wade, has warned that abortion 
rights may soon "go down the drain." Four of the nine current Supreme Court 
justices want to overturn the Roe decision, and three of Roe's supporters are 
in their 80s. 
</P>
<P>
Roe will go. And when that happens, all hell will break loose. "Taking away 
rights that have already been given is a hard thing to pull off," said Kate 
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League. 
Millions of American women have had abortions. Despite increased restrictions, 
the abortion rate has remained steady at 1.5 million a year during the Reagan 
years. A decision recriminalizing abortion will be as divisive for Republicans 
as the 1954 school desegregation decision was for Democrats. Reagan was lucky. 
He demanded an end to abortions but it didn't happen on his watch. Bush won't 
be so lucky.

MIXING SIGNALS ON CAPITOL GRIDLOCK

Go-o-o-d morning, Sacramento! Californians have some New Year's resolutions to 
propose: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Balance Proposition 103's attack on soaring insurance premiums with curbs 
on claim costs and attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take responsibility for restructuring the Gann spending limit to fit 
current budget realities and quit bucking tough fiscal decisions to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Address the issues raised by the FBI sting, initiative mania and the 
Speakership wars by a comprehensive approach to government reform and not 
merely cosmetic tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Face the critical questions of what the quality of life in California 
should be and who should pay for it -- and stop ducking complex issues like 
health care, the environment, toxics, transportation, growth controls and 
regional government. 
</P>
<P>
How realistic are these resolutions? That's not easy to predict. Because what 
happens in Sacramento in 1989 will depend primarily on Gov. George Deukmejian, 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and the onslaught of reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's decision whether or not to seek reelection will influence policy 
direction. Will he be persuaded to run by advisers who argue he has the best 
chance to keep the governor's chair Republican and thus prevent a Democratic 
gerrymander in the 1991 reapportionment? 
</P>
<P>
Or, looking toward retirement, will he opt to abandon his stubborn naysaying 
and attempt to build a legacy? 
</P>
<P>
Early signals are mixed. After mellowing on Gann limit revisions, he's again 
mulling wholesale budget chopping. 
</P>
<P>
The pledge that Speaker Brown recently made to ease up on politicking and 
concentrate on policy-making could also help chart a positive course for state 
government. Again, signals are mixed -- in view of the partisan sniping at 
Deukmejian's nominee for state treasurer by Brown's lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker's definition of "doing policy" is crucial. Policy-making is not 
selectively taking over legislators' bills and ramming them through the 
Assembly. A "boutique" approach to problem-solving is not leadership. 
</P>
<P>
A leader allows lawmakers to nurture their own programs, and then protects 
their bills through the entire Legislature and the governor's office, too. He 
stands up to special interests who fund legislative campaigns and then stymie 
legislative action. (In 1989, the real test will be if Brown opposes the 
state's trial lawyers, key political supporters, for enactment of comprehensive 
insurance reform.) 
</P>
<P>
But the strongest influence may be reapportionment. To make policy, legislators 
have to get elected, and governors need legislative majorities of their own 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Will Assembly Republicans, led by their confrontational leader, Ross Johnson of 
La Habra, frustrate policy through partisan, obstructionist games designed to 
wound the Democratic majority before reapportionment? 
</P>
<P>
Will dissident legislative Democrats quiet down in exchange for a "kinder, 
gentler" redistricting? 
</P>
<P>
Will incumbents and leaders of both parties opt to play it safe -- and not risk 
any new policy initiatives before reapportionment can assure their continued 
political survival? 
</P>
<P>
Who can predict whether 1989 will bring an end to Sacramento's political 
gridlock? The denizens of the state Capitol might prefer to hibernate until 
reapportionment season. But perhaps, as Assemblyman Richard Katz of Sepulveda 
speculated, "If more solutions don't start coming out of this place, then no 
one will be around for reapportionment." 
</P>
<P>
If this prediction doesn't stir some resolve in Sacramento, nothing will.

ITALY DEBATES A CAPITAL IDEA -- DOWN WITH ROME! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By George Armstrong, George Armstrong is the Rome correspondent for Britain's 
Guardian newspaper. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ROME 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was the decision to make Rome the capital of Italy, taken in the last century, 
a mistake even bigger than the Colosseum itself? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, says Luigi Firpo, a history professor at Turin University and one of the 
luminaries among Italian intelligentsia. His opinion has probably been held by 
millions of other Italians since Rome actually became the Italian capital in 
1870. It is an opinion likely to gain adherents in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Many Romans, or those who call themselves Romans, agree that the Eternal City 
seems each day less likely to hold on to that defiant label much longer. For 
them, Rome entered an alarming new chapter around AD 1950, the year when 
everyone who could switched from bicycles to cars, and folks flocked in from 
the hills to join the Roman circus. 
</P>
<P>
Firpo, who now also sits in Parliament, has said that the degradation of Rome 
is total. The Romans are vulgar, arrogant and ignorant, he claims, and the city 
"does not deserve to be the capital." For him, Rome is "the only Levantine city 
without a European quarter." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks, uttered first in Parliament then repeated and expanded in 
interviews, brought a denial from his political party that he was speaking for 
them, and then angry words from the city's political bosses. Some of their 
responses were impoverished, falling back on the line that Rome was the natural 
capital because it once had been the capital of the Western World. 
</P>
<P>
This, Firpo said, was "imperial rhetoric." Harking back to the empire was also 
one of Benito Mussolini's gambits, when the Italian dictator was playing from 
his balcony to cheering Roman crowds. Mussolini spoke of his Rome as being the 
city's third incarnation. First, the Rome of the Caesars, then the Rome of the 
Popes and finally the Rome of his glorious new Fascist regime. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Metternich, the 19th-Century Austrian statesman, dismissed the Italy of 
his time as being "more a geographical expression than a country." A little 
later, Firpo's native Piedmont, the northwestern Italian region that borders 
Switzerland and France, produced a handful of noblemen who thought that Italy 
should become a unified nation for the first time since the fall of the Roman 
Empire. In 1861 the Piedmontese Parliament declared that one day Rome would be 
the new Italian capital. The rest of the country was then under foreign 
domination; Rome and other parts of Italy were ruled by the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in Turin, one unification supporter, 
the Marquis Massimo D'Azeglio, said, "We've created an Italy -- now we must 
create the Italians." A strong argument could be made that his second goal is 
still a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
To relieve the Pope of his temporal powers, the Piedmontese entered Rome on 
Sept. 20, 1870, set up their king in what until the day before had been the 
Pope's residence and found themselves in possession of a city of fewer than 
200,000 people, living in a poverty unknown elsewhere on the Italian peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Today Rome's official population is 3 million, but each day it continues to 
attract migrants from hill towns and farms, drawn like moths to the bright 
lights. They soon find themselves living in shantytowns on the outskirts, 
without electricity or even plumbing. The arches of Roman aqueducts, built 
2,000 years ago to supply water for Nero's baths, are now bricked up by 
migrants and serve as dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
A cover story on a feisty Italian weekly, Espresso, some time ago was titled, 
"When the Capital Is Corrupt -- the Nation Is Infected." That was, and probably 
is, the attitude of Milan or any other modern metropolitan area in northern 
Italy toward the nation's capital. Each year the northern regions see their tax 
payments shipped to Rome for distribution in favor of southern Italy, an area 
just as rich in natural resources as the north and with double the 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Moravia, the dean of Italian novelists, now a spry 83, is a Rome 
native. He was one of the first to jump on Firpo for his remarks, reminding him 
that when the Piedmontese entered Rome, they demolished many splendid buildings 
and private gardens to make Rome "more modern." A few days later, Moravia 
recalled that he himself had written against Rome a few years back and offered 
proof that Firpo was not all that original in his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Moravia had said: "Rome is not worthy of the name of being a European capital, 
like Paris or London. It is not a model for the nation to follow, but a sterile 
bureaucratic sponge that absorbs everything and gives nothing. Though the 
center of the church, it is the world's least spiritual city. Religion is 
present more with its bureaucracy than with its sentiment . . . . There is no 
circulation of ideas and persons in Rome, meaning there is no society of 
either." 
</P>
<P>
When Firpo was asked where he would prefer to have the Italian capital, he 
said, "Somewhere near Chiusi, but in open country." Both he and Moravia agree 
that Chiusi -- an old Etruscan town midway between Rome and Florence -- is only 
their utopian dream. It is too late for an Italian Pretoria, Canberra, Brasilia 
or Washington, even though with their cars, Italy's central government and the 
entire elephantine bureaucracy are destroying the remains of both ancient and 
modern Rome with a wanton thoroughness that would give pause to Attila the Hun. 
</P>
<P>
If it had not been deemed necessary to dislodge the Pope from his temporal 
control over Rome, some of the Piedmontese were touting Naples as the nation's 
capital. It was, after all, the largest Italian city and still a major cultural 
influence in Europe. However, the Sicilians said they would never again accept 
Naples as a sovereign seat. 
</P>
<P>
What a pity. The Neapolitans have been living by their wits for centuries. They 
are clever about inventing jobs and pulling rabbits out of other peoples' hats. 
They are nimble, too, as people who choose to live under a smoldering volcano 
need to be. They have produced great painters, poets, composers, writers, 
architects -- while Rome has failed to produce even one. 
</P>
<P>
Had Naples become the Italian capital 100 years ago, it would have tilted the 
scale in favor of the Italian peninsula becoming a Mediterranean country, not 
what it is now -- an angry mix, half-European and half-Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
That is what Luigi Firpo's rage against Rome is all about. He spoke for 
millions of Italians who consider themselves European, and, incidentally, 
probably spoke also for foreign Europeans who must do business in Italy and who 
find themselves beating their heads against the city's bureaucratic rubber 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
The only way out of this Italian dilemma is for the north to secede from the 
union. Both sides would be winners.

NICARAGUA STRUGGLES TO AID ITS CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Harry Nelson, Harry Nelson, a former health and medical writer for The 
Times, specializes in Third World health issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MANAGUA, NICARAGUA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight years of socially and economically devastating war with U.S.-backed 
Contra forces -- topped off 10 weeks ago by the most destructive hurricane in 
decades -- have sucked much of the substance but not the spirit from 
Nicaragua's 3.6 million people. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago Nicaraguans talked enthusiastically of government campaigns to 
reduce infant mortality, eradicate malaria, distribute land to the landless and 
wipe out illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
For a while great strides were made toward realizing those goals. But today, 
for the first time since the revolution that overthrew dictator Anastasio 
Somoza in 1979, children beg on the streets as government officials reluctantly 
slash health programs that once drew international praise. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan children who have been 
displaced, wounded, orphaned or otherwise traumatized by the Contra war, the 
U.S. Congress appropriated $17.7 million. Two days after President Reagan 
signed the bill on Oct. 1, President Daniel Ortega said Nicaragua would not 
accept the money. 
</P>
<P>
To Nicaraguans, refusing the aid was a symbol of dignity and national pride. 
Tied to the legislation was a second bill that provided a similar amount in 
non-lethal aid to the Contras, the very forces whose attacks on civilian 
outposts were -- and still are -- responsible for the misery of many children. 
</P>
<P>
For Nicaragua to have accepted the aid, said Paul Oquist, an adviser to Ortega, 
would be comparable to the United States having accepted a donation of blood 
from Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. wants to help children, lift the trade embargo and stop the war," 
he said. "That would stop the production of orphans and allow more (Nicaraguan) 
resources to deal with the problem ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the Sandinistas say the party's bungling management of the economy 
is the real reason for its desperate straights. They accuse the Sandinistas of 
torpedoing peace efforts with the Contras, suppressing the opposition press, 
squelching political dissent and endlessly confounding friend and foe alike 
with contradictory actions. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, representatives of U.S. and foreign relief agencies based here 
and even mothers who have lost sons in the war say they supported Ortega's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
A summary of the immense effects of the war on children appears in a 
little-publicized report prepared last summer by a team of American health 
professionals sent to Nicaragua on behalf of the U.S. Agency for International 
Development to assess children's needs. Among their findings, gleaned from 
interviews with 40 humanitarian agencies working here and with the Nicaraguan 
government: 
</P>
<P>
 -- About 500,000 of the nation's 1.8 million children under age 17 have been 
directly affected through destruction or disruption of schools and other 
services, displacement from homes, death of parents, injuries and psychological 
trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At least 455 children under 15 years have been killed and 691 are missing 
through the end of 1987. Another 1,542 under 15 have been wounded, with an 
additional 1,865 wounded among youngsters aged 15 through 20. About 1,200 have 
experienced serious physical handicaps such as amputations and 568 children 
have lost both parents, while 138 lost mothers and 9,371 lost fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As many as 50,000 children have suffered psychological trauma after seeing 
their villages shot up, parents or neighbors killed and having been forced to 
resettle in strange areas. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cease-fire treaty of last spring, attacks on farm cooperatives and 
killing and wounding of children continue. In October, in the province of 
Jinotega, a well-marked Red Cross ambulance was shot up by Contras and one 
passenger was wounded. The Contras also attacked a civilian truck, killing nine 
civilians, three of them women. Two children injured in the attack later died. 
Four civilians were killed in an attack in another province that occurred only 
hours before Hurricane Joan struck on Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Two American physicians, Tim Takaro and Susan Cookson, who have worked for two 
years in the Jinotega war zone, said $300,000 of the U.S. aid had been slated 
for treating intestinal parasites in 30,000 children in their region. But 
conditions imposed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which 
administers such aid funding, would have undermined the existing health system 
in Nicaragua, they said. 
</P>
<P>
AID requires that any private agency receiving federal funds have no connection 
with the Nicaraguan Health Ministry. Yet Takaro, Cookson and other U.S. health 
workers here agree that all private agencies working in health cooperate with 
the government system because that is the most efficient and economical way to 
get services to the people. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Health Ministry's goals since the 1979 revolution has been to expand 
health centers in rural areas. The policy saved many lives during the Contra 
conflict. Last summer's report by the American team on the needs of children 
noted with some surprise that the primary medical and social needs of most 
war-injured and orphaned children had already been cared for within government 
facilities. Most who required specialized care not available in Nicaragua were 
sent to Eastern Bloc countries, it said. Several Health Ministry doctors said 
there has been great difficulty arranging for specialized care in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The priority need now, the report said, is for continuing rehabilitation within 
the children's own homes. 
</P>
<P>
All U.S. federal aid to Nicaragua was suspended in 1981. Some of the slack has 
been taken up by U.S. allies, including Canada, Sweden, Holland, Italy, France, 
Spain and other European countries who have contributed hundreds of millions of 
dollars in medical supplies and assistance. Health Ministry officials said the 
severe strains on the economy have forced them to charge for certain health 
services that were previously free. 
</P>
<P>
Health workers have also been victims of Contra attacks. So far this year, 
according to Takaro and Cookson, two volunteer Nicaraguan health workers 
(brigadistas) have been killed in Jinotega province alone, eight have been 
kidnaped and three are missing. 
</P>
<P>
Because brigadistas live in communities where there is usually no doctor or 
nurse, their services are highly valued. 
</P>
<P>
"They are hard to replace when killed because others become too frightened to 
volunteer," Cookson said. "Eight health centers have been attacked by Contras 
in Jinotega this year. Some were destroyed and the medicine supplies were 
always destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Joan added to the general misery because of the destruction of crops, 
homes, roads, bridges and service centers totaling $828 million, according to 
the Social Welfare Ministry. Officials predict severe food shortages beginning 
in the spring as a result of ruined bean and corn crops. The ministry has 
called for $16.1 million in aid to clothe and feed for six months the 118,000 
children whose lives were disrupted by the hurricane.

ISRAELI COALITION AND ARAFAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For once, before offering such generous but the unasked for advice, put 
yourselves in Israel's place (editorial, "Israel: Starting Over," Dec. 21). The 
tiny country is surrounded by vicious enemies, who not only hate the Jewish 
state (as well as other non-Arab entities in the area: the Kurds, the Copts, 
the Armenians, etc.) but also each other. 
</P>
<P>
Who has Israel to talk to? The cowardly Jordanian monarch? Egypt, a country 
rocked by pro-Khomeini unrest, whose population has never accepted peace with 
Israel, and whose armed forces are being mindlessly and continuously 
strengthened by Western states? Iraq, Syria, Lybia -- all of whom control the 
Palestine Liberation Organization? 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that The Times does not urge totalitarian Arab states and terrorist 
organizations to put down their weapons, and stop all provocations? And what of 
"an international peace meeting?" 
</P>
<P>
Who will decide the future of Israel, who will guarantee its existence? 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, an archaic colonial empire, whose unity is cemented by tanks 
and the blood of martyred White Russians, Ukrainians, Afghans, and the Balts? 
The United States, whose loyalty to its allies can be eloquently witnessed to 
by the late Shah of Iran, the betrayed anti-Castro Cubans of the Bay of Pigs, 
the Contras, the South Vietnamese? Or maybe pro-Arab France and Greece will 
guarantee Israel's right to exist? 
</P>
<P>
Israel has no choice but to forge a strong coalition, maintain a unity 
government, strengthen itself, and realize that in this world nobody can 
guarantee anything. The best Israel will get, if it depends on such generous 
advice, as The Times has given it, is a motion picture about its destruction. 
We will all cry and wonder why the second Holocaust was allowed. 
</P>
<P>
If the Israeli government decides to build Jewish settlements in the historic 
Jewish land, then it must do so -- without waiting for advice from a slanted 
and biased American media, whose news reporters eagerly write "Israeli-occupied 
West Bank," but never write "Soviet-occupied Estonia," or "provocative Arab 
plans for the destruction of Israel."

FIXING THE WRONG THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the two national political parties begin working together to make things 
"better," better beware. During the last campaign, Democrats and Republicans 
formed a commission to grab sponsorship of the last presidential debate away 
from the League of Women Voters. The result was that the two presidential 
campaigns were able to dictate ground rules that resulted not in a real debate 
but in an excessively restricted and programmed question-answer session. 
</P>
<P>
Now the parties have joined in a new bipartisan commission to do something 
about the national political conventions. The commission has been directed to 
propose ways of streamlining the conventions so that they are more appealing to 
Americans on television. This is in obvious response to the poor ratings that 
the conventions drew last summer and to network television's reluctance to 
carry the entire proceedings. Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the retiring Republican 
national chairman, said that there had been criticism from the media that the 
conventions "have become nothing more than staged activities in which nominees 
give canned speeches." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that this dog is barking up the wrong tree. What needs fixing is 
the pre-convention nominating process that goes on forever and produces winners 
long before the delegates gather. The prospective nominees thus have control of 
the convention program and arrange things so that there is a minimum of 
uncertainty and controversy. This year even the names of the vice presidential 
running mates were known in advance, so the conventions were robbed of any 
remaining tidbit of suspense. 
</P>
<P>
What the national parties must do is shorten the primary campaign and start it 
someplace other than Iowa or New Hampshire. They need to be willing to have 
actual issues debated on the convention floor. They need some spontaneity and 
real action -- perhaps even a multiple roll-call contest for the nomination. 
They do not need more programming, but less. Fix the primary process, and the 
convention problem will fix itself.

VERBAL VIRUS

A brilliant hacker at Cornell University recently taught us how much damage a 
computer virus can do to communications' nervous systems, but we had long known 
that terminal disease has an electronic application. More troubling, perhaps 
because more human, is a language virus, transmitted orally or on paper, that 
spreads and replicates until meaning itself is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The term sea-change, for example, surges through the media these days, usually 
suggesting something mammoth -- as a sea-change in Soviet politics or a 
sea-change in Sean Penn's police relations. The original usage was 
Shakespeare's, and the bard was literally suggesting what the sea could do to a 
human body. Only in 1988 did a tidal wave of sea-changes cover the land as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably is, arguably, the latest fad in suggesting uncertainty. The trouble is 
the way it appears everywhere and may confuse -- should be argued or may be 
argued -- even as it hedges. 
</P>
<P>
A learned editor in this neighborhood has decided to forbid writers from having 
anyone shoot himself or herself or themselves in the foot to describe 
inadvertent behavior. If all the recently shot feet stood end-to-end, they 
would stretch the length of the John Muir Trail. 
</P>
<P>
Unique is a word that isn't. This virus has so infected the language that 
particular or unusual or other simple, less assertive terms for rarity have all 
but disappeared in favor of a one and only connotation -- usually false, often 
in an advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
Cliches are the most common strain of language virus. Gobbledygook is the 
mutation most often affecting bureaucrats and politicians who would rather be 
obscure than be right. The National Council of Teachers of English awarded 
Public Doublespeak citations for 1988 to the agricultural spokesperson who 
called pigs and cows "grain-consuming animal units," and to the safety expert 
who described an aircraft crash as "uncontrolled contact with the ground." 
</P>
<P>
At this point in time, our lingering wheeze from Watergate days, there is no 
vaccine for verbal virus. Susceptible word-consuming human units are advised to 
avoid talk shows and look out for 30-second spots.

LITTLE CHOCOLATE DOUGHNUTS TELL THE TALE OF THE U.S. TRADE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH ROBINSON, Keith Robinson is a syndicated cartoonist in Manhattan Beach 
whose book, Making It: a Survival Guide for Today, has just been published by 
Harper &amp; Row.

<TEXT>
<P>
We hear a lot of talk that if the United States were allowed to compete on an 
equal footing with foreign manufacturers, our product quality and marketing 
skills would once again make us No. 1 in the world. Well, I offer for 
consideration the following true story (I've protected the names of the 
manufacturers involved, but any connoisseur of little chocolate doughnuts will 
recognize their identities). 
</P>
<P>
Brand X is recognized as the Cadillac of little chocolate doughnuts -- light, 
fresh, with a chocolatey coating that is thick. Sweet. Oh-so-yummy. Most 
people's first choice. 
</P>
<P>
But we don't always have a choice. The micro-mini-market near me (selling 
"booze 'n' munchies," according to its sign) carried only Brand Y -- heavy, dry 
little chocolate doughnuts with a dark, oil-slick coating that leaves you 
looking as if you've just been fingerprinted. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when you wake up at the crack of noon needing little chocolate doughnuts 
to get your day started, you take what you can get. 
</P>
<P>
(Anyone who asks why I don't just go to the supermarket once a week and buy the 
ValuePak of Brand X little chocolate doughnuts should stop reading. You've no 
understanding of the American consumer and will miss the point of the story.) 
</P>
<P>
One morning, overcome by the urge for little chocolate doughnuts, I walked into 
the booze 'n' munchies store for a dose of Brand Y's LCDs. 
</P>
<P>
With a grimace, I bit into one. WHAM! Light, fresh! Oh-so-yummy! I looked at 
the package: no "New and Improved!" No "Now with even MORE Chocolatey 
Goodness!" But yes -- they were good! Almost as good (dare I think it?) as 
Brand X! 
</P>
<P>
I could purchase Brand Y little chocolate doughnuts proudly, no longer afraid 
that others were looking upon me with scorn ("Mommy! He's buying Brand Y!" 
"Don't point, Junior. Some people aren't as fortunate as we are. . . ."). It 
was a wonderful day! 
</P>
<P>
A month later the booze 'n' munchies store was sold. The new owner was behind 
the counter one morning as I bought my pack of Brand Y little chocolate 
doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
"Going to start getting Brand X," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Great, although these have gotten a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "Well, now you'll have your choice." 
</P>
<P>
You'll have your choice! Boy, that's the American way. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, a few days later, there they were, side-by-side: Brand X and Brand 
Y. What a great moment it was, being able to buy Brand X little chocolate 
doughnuts, the BEST little chocolate doughnuts. Only. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Something strange hit me midway through my first pack of Brand X little 
chocolate doughnuts in months -- I missed Brand Y. Had I grown accustomed to 
Brand Y's lower quality? Was Brand X too rich for my blood? 
</P>
<P>
The next day I held a taste test, alternating a little chocolate doughnut from 
Brand X with one from Brand Y. After 12 little chocolate doughnuts, I arrived 
at the startling conclusion: Brand Y had surpassed Brand X in chocolatey 
yumminess. I switched back to Brand Y. And I was happy. For about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
One morning I stumbled into the B 'n' M store for breakfast. No Brand Y little 
chocolate doughnuts. They weren't just out -- the entire rack was gone. Little 
chocolate doughnuts, cupcakes, wholesome snack pies -- everything. 
</P>
<P>
"The Brand Y people refused to be in the same store with Brand X," explained 
the owner. "Said if I kept selling Brand X, they'd pull out." 
</P>
<P>
"But I like their little chocolate doughnuts better than Brand X's," I 
protested. 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "Love to sell both, but Brand X has the better name." 
</P>
<P>
So I bought Brand X. Don't get me wrong -- they were good. But they weren't 
Brand Y. 
</P>
<P>
Next morning, Brand X was sold out. 
</P>
<P>
"Distributor comes Thursdays," said the owner. This was Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After a little-chocolate-doughnutless weekend, I went into the store Monday. 
There, where once the Brand Y rack had stood, was a rack of Brand Z products -- 
cupcakes, wholesome snack pies and . . . little chocolate doughnuts. I bought a 
pack. 
</P>
<P>
Eeyew! 
</P>
<P>
Brand Z little chocolate doughnuts are not as bad as the old Brand Y little 
chocolate doughnuts were, but Brand Z little chocolate doughnuts, as I'm sure 
you experts will agree, simply have no taste. They're only good for the 
desperate times when Brand X is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
Which is usually. The booze 'n' munchies store gets its shipment of Brand X 
little chocolate doughnuts every Thursday. By Friday, they're sold out. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell the guy every week to bring more," shrugs the owner. "Now, the Brand Z 
guys, they always make sure we're stocked." 
</P>
<P>
Using the booze 'n' munchies store as our representative sample of the American 
market, what have we learned? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brand X, the brand with the best reputation, ignores feedback and winds up 
selling a fraction what it could. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brand Y, the brand with the best product, refuses to compete in an open 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brand Z, the worst of the three, is left to score the biggest sales. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as I sit here munching yet another Brand Z little chocolate doughnut, I 
can't help but wonder. In the huge conglomerate headquarters of Brand Z's 
parent company, just what language do you suppose they're speaking?

WHERE WAS U.S. IN NICARAGUA'S HOUR OF NEED?; 
</P>
<P>
DENIAL OF HUMANITARIAN AID CLASHES WITH OPEN HEARTS TOWARD ARMENIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICKEY LELAND, Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) is chairman of the House Select 
Committee on Hunger. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sight of rescue teams from around the world ignoring politics and rushing 
help to victims of the earthquake in Soviet Armenia has been one of the bright 
spots of a holiday season dimmed by disaster. We in the United States can take 
pride in our contribution. 
</P>
<P>
The instinctive response to the plight of the Armenians sent forth a signal 
that the people of the world realize that we live in a global village. Leaders 
of the Soviet Union abandoned their policy of secrecy and isolation while 
long-time adversaries of the Soviet Union put aside past animosities. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson of Armenia is that politics is not an issue when human beings have 
suffered terrible loss. A notable example came from an Israeli rescue team, 
some of whom had emigrated from the Soviet Union with no thought of returning. 
Although the two nations have not had diplomatic relations for more than 20 
years, this did not hinder the mission in Spitak and Leninakan. The team stayed 
for more than two weeks, triumphing when a 15-year-old boy was pulled alive 
from the debris eight days after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there are children much closer to us geographically than those 
in Armenia who are homeless and hungry and whose parents have lost their lives 
or livelihoods in a natural disaster. These children and their families have 
not received aid through the government of the United States. They are the 
victims of Hurricane Joan in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
While the disaster in Armenia was of much greater dimension, Hurricane Joan had 
a devastating effect on Nicaragua. It left 250,000 persons homeless. Almost 3 
million people lost crops or otherwise suffered economic loss. Hospitals and 
schools were damaged or destroyed. A team of United Nations economists has 
estimated the loss at $840 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite appeals from members of Congress and private groups such as Oxfam and 
the American Friends Service Committee, the United States has refused 
assistance to Nicaragua. Jamaica and Costa Rica, hit by the same storm, 
received help from this country. There have been no explanations as to why 
Nicaragua was counted out. Politics is the only apparent cause. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, U.S. policy has been to provide disaster relief as a purely 
humanitarian gesture, independent of politics. This dates back to a successful 
program led by Herbert Hoover to restore Europe after World War I and has 
continued through the Marshall Plan until today. In 1988 such aid went to 
victims of floods in Bangladesh and the Sudan, monsoons in India and Nepal, 
Typhoon Ruby in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
These actions flow from the Foreign Assistance Act, which authorizes the 
President "to furnish assistance to any foreign country, international 
organization, or private voluntary organization, on such terms and conditions 
as he may determine, for international disaster relief and rehabilitation." The 
responsibility is clearly the President's. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan, in a recent interview with David Brinkley, called Nicaraguan 
President Daniel Ortega a "shameless dictator" who "doesn't stand in the same 
box with (Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev." Has the politics of aid 
reached the point of distinguishing between avowed communists when giving or 
withholding humanitarian aid? Should we allow the behavior of the Sandinistas 
to keep us from responding to people stricken by disaster? 
</P>
<P>
While we are not in open conflict with either the Soviet Union or Nicaragua, 
the recent history of national enmity makes it imperative to maintain the 
principle of nonpolitical humanitarian aid to innocent civilians. To undermine 
this principle erodes the internationally accepted Geneva conventions that have 
enabled the Red Cross, the Red Crescent and other agencies to bring medicine 
and food to noncombatants in times of war. 
</P>
<P>
The only country in the world that could pose a serious, immediate threat to 
the United States is the Soviet Union. Yet, we have responded generously to 
innocent civilians in that country in their hour of need. Under Anastasio 
Somoza, whose regime was more brutal and repressive, the United States provided 
relief to Nicaraguan earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters have been told that the Nicaraguan government would not accept 
assistance if it were offered. The National Assembly did reject a portion of 
the Contra aid package intended for all children who had been injured by the 
civil strife. In mid-November Ortega clarified that the ban was limited to the 
Contra package. Shortly thereafter, the Nicaraguan charge d'affaires in 
Washington said publicly that U. S. aid would be accepted through international 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The new openness of the Soviet government, as it welcomes outside help and 
becomes more a part of the world community, is a sign to the incoming 
Administration to reverse a foreign policy that has too often put ideology 
above basic human needs, above values that transcend government or party. It is 
time to reaffirm the American tradition of generous response to need simply 
because the need exists. 
</P>
<P>
Providing humanitarian aid promotes the national interests of the United 
States. We must recognize, however, that such aid makes its greatest 
contribution to our credibility and our reputation in the world when it is 
delivered in a nonpolitical manner.

BY GOING FOR BROKE, U.S. FOULS FARM TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You don't need a Ph.D in economics to understand the European Community's 
common agricultural policy. It sets artificially high farm prices that create 
vast food surpluses. In November, for example, the world price for corn 
averaged $97 a metric ton. Meanwhile, the policy promised European farmers a 
minimum price of $212, a 119% premium. Naturally, European farmers produce as 
much as they can. Any surpluses are then dumped onto the world market with huge 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear who's hurt. First come Europe's consumers and taxpayers. Their food 
costs are too high, and 60% to 80% of the European Community's budget goes to 
the policy. Next come more efficient farmers -- in the United States, 
Australia, Canada, Argentina and other nations -- who lose export sales to the 
Europeans. Considering all these victims, there ought to be strong pressure on 
the European Community to change the policy. Think again. An intense U.S. 
campaign against the policy has had almost no success. 
</P>
<P>
It's a telling failure of economic diplomacy. Increasingly, the United States 
can advance its economic interests abroad only with the help of other nations. 
We're no longer so powerful that we can control the outcome of global 
negotiations. But we're clumsy at creating the international coalitions 
necessary to prevail. The farm negotiations (under the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, or GATT) are a case in point. When the talks recently broke 
down in Montreal, the Americans -- not the Europeans -- were mainly blamed. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake: The talks are critical for U.S. agriculture. They may 
represent the best chance for America to cut its own costly farm subsidies. 
American harvests are steadily rising; last summer's drought only interrupted a 
long-term trend. Without expanding exports, U.S. farmers face rising surpluses 
and falling prices. The pressures for continued subsidies would be enormous. 
Other food exporters confront the same dilemma. Finally, greater agricultural 
exports would help some developing countries escape the debt crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But somehow U.S. trade negotiators have turned a strong moral position into 
political weakness. It's not that other food exporters like the agricultural 
policy. They don't. Most of the European Community's minimum prices (like that 
of corn) are set well above market levels. In November, the minimum price for a 
metric ton of soybeans was $577, more than double the world price of $267. 
Consumers pay these high prices. The Community maintains them by buying any 
surpluses at the minimums. Cheaper imports are generally kept out with variable 
levies that raise import prices slightly above the minimums. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that farmers elsewhere lose exports to Europe and must compete 
with European food surpluses -- sold at subsidized prices -- in third 
countries. The policy's protection has kept high-cost farmers in business. 
Efficient farmers are spurred to increase output by overusing fertilizers and 
pesticides. Food production has soared. The European Community once imported 
wheat; it became an exporter in the early 1970s. Since 1980, output of oil 
seeds (such as soybeans) has more than quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
By all logic, the Australians, Canadians and others ought to be loudly echoing 
U.S. demands that the Europeans alter the policy. But the United States has 
alienated its natural allies by insisting that all countries commit themselves 
-- in advance of detailed negotiations -- to the eventual elimination of most 
farm subsidies. For the Europeans, this would mean signing an immediate death 
warrant for the policy. That's political suicide. It was this humiliating 
demand that caused the breakdown at Montreal. Other governments regard the U.S. 
position as wildly unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
It's also unnecessary. The issue is not (as the U.S. position implies) all or 
nothing. Suppose the policy's excessive prices are cut 60% to 80% over a 
decade. That would be an immense achievement. But the talks are now stalemated 
over a non-negotiable principle. The Europeans have scored a public-relations 
coup and don't have to say how they'd change the policy to reduce its adverse 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
The agricultural policy is not, of course, the only example of farm folly. In 
addition to direct subsidies, the United States maintains import quotas on 
sugar and dairy products. Japan and Korea restrict rice imports. Any trade 
agreement would have to attack all these distortions. The political obstacles 
are similar everywhere. Farmers have grown dependent on protection, and 
governments often depend on the votes of farmers. But opening up world 
agriculture is not a utopian dream. It has a big constituency -- food exporters 
and, less obviously, taxpayers and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that the United States has yet to mobilize this constituency. 
Any hard negotiation is full of drama and deadlocks. The GATT talks are 
scheduled to continue until 1990. They could yet succeed. But for that to 
happen, the United States will have to pursue its goals more adeptly. That's 
the real lesson here. Being right is not enough if, in the process, everyone 
else is offended by American self-righteousness.

OUR FORCES ARE AT THE READY, BUT NOT FOR CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By C. A. H. TROST, Adm. C.A.H. Trost is chief of naval operations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As concerns about the American economy grow, the debate over defense spending 
continues at a feverish pace. An entire spectrum of ideas has been placed 
before the public, with critics or "defense experts" having their own agenda on 
how to cut defense in an effort to reduce the nation's budgetary deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions of cuts that indiscriminately have an impact on defense 
capabilities and current military readiness are both disconcerting and 
frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
The last eight years have seen some unmistakable gains in our military 
readiness and capability. U.S. naval forces (in fact, all U.S. military forces) 
have never been stronger or more ready. America's position in the world has 
also never been so strong. Our friends, who have never feared our leadership 
and have only wanted to count on our strength, can do just that. And potential 
adversaries now have to recalculate their ambitions because of our strength. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we see a move by various people who seem hellbent on throwing those 
gains away. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, our political leaders -- with the support of the American 
public -- committed themselves to an investment. The investment was a large 
one, but was necessary to recover from the neglect of the 1970s when the 
military suffered from low states of readiness. Some ships couldn't sail 
because of material problems and personnel shortages; aircraft readiness was 
low because of lack of spare parts and trained maintenance personnel; morale 
problems abounded. 
</P>
<P>
This tremendous investment provided the nation with an extremely capable fleet 
and a professional personnel force that has never been more dedicated, spirited 
or well-trained. Simply stated, never has the Navy been more ready to respond 
to a wide range of contingencies and threats. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, does the nation have the resolve to preserve its investment or 
is it willing to return to the dark days of just a few years ago? To allow the 
latter to happen and fail to protect the investment would be the biggest case 
of fraud, waste and abuse this country has ever seen. History has repeatedly 
shown us the consequences of complacency. 
</P>
<P>
The critics would like to make us believe that we can't afford a strong 
military. They argue that the defense buildup has caused the budget deficit. 
Today, however, defense spending is less than 6% of our gross national product. 
During the years of the so-called Reagan buildup, it was never more than 6.3% 
-- and it has declined steadily in the last four years. But 20 years ago, that 
figure was 9% -- and we had a balanced federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
If one looks at a graph of defense and non-defense spending since 1969 (the 
last year of a balanced budget), we see that the curve for defense is 
relatively flat but that the curve for non-defense spending keeps turning 
upward at an alarming rate. And the key point is that the curve almost exactly 
matches the slope of our federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
It is frustrating for those in senior military positions -- those who are 
directly responsible for providing for our nation's security and who had to 
deal firsthand with our diminished capability in the last decade -- to see the 
apparent complacency, the almost perverted idealism, the unscrupulous 
politicking and the inability to see reason and logic in the one element of our 
great democracy in which the national interest should be above parochial 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
It is frustrating to deal with those who argue that because we have built 
something that works, we can afford to neglect it for a while. It is 
frustrating to argue with those who can't stand success, who can't seem to be 
comfortable with strength and who would apparently prefer being lovable losers. 
</P>
<P>
Why are we turning our backs on defense? People listen to Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, probably the greatest PR man in this century, and they 
think, in the immortal words of Neville Chamberlain, that we will have "peace 
for our time." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it's not true; or at least, not yet. 
</P>
<P>
It has long been a military axiom that you must not get tangled up trying to 
unravel your opponent's intentions. Instead, you must keep your eyes on 
capabilities. To that end, many intelligent people seem to overlook the fact 
that Soviet military capabilities continue to grow while their intentions are 
being slickly packaged to look like democracy in action. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly something is happening in the Soviet Union today. But what it is, 
what it means and how long it will last are still uncertainties. The Soviets 
have not dismantled a single military system that they were not bound to do 
under constraints of treaty. Except in Afghanistan, they have not withdrawn 
from a single maritime or military position. 
</P>
<P>
It's still a very dangerous world and the threat still threatens. We can watch 
and hope. But let's keep our heads on straight.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: KUDOS TO THOSE WHO WERE NICE TO US IN '88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that 1988 is behind us, it's a good time to acknowledge those who helped 
make our travel experiences bearable, even enjoyable, last year. Some awards -- 
not for anyone who has been naughty, but only for those who've been nice. 
</P>
<P>
Best First-Class Service: Singapore Airlines. Again this airline wins for 
class, as well as style. It even wins for food, some of which is cooked to 
order on board. If you like your eggs poached, they'll be poached. 
</P>
<P>
Best Business-Class Service: British Airways. The airline has come a long way 
from the old business class of coach seats and a few free drinks. Its new Club 
Class is well recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Honorable mention to Virgin Atlantic. The airline's "upper-class" service is a 
well-kept secret. It's excellent, and equals, if not surpasses, other airlines' 
first-class sections in terms of passenger space and other goodies, like a free 
one-way coach ticket for taking just one trip. 
</P>
<P>
Best Coach Service: Lufthansa. Efficient, courteous and even the meals are 
thoughtful, with things like fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Best First-Class Seats: If you want to know the reason why Royal Jordanian 
Airlines has spent upwards of $10,000 per first-class airline seat, just sit 
down. These hydraulic electric marvels are truly the closest things to real 
beds an airline can provide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rivals to First Class 
</P>
<P>
Best Business-Class Seats: a tie, between Cathay Pacific Airlines and British 
Airways. Both airlines radically restructured their business class in 1988, and 
a major part of that included removing and redesigning business-class seats, 
head rests, leg rests and added leg room. And both airlines did almost too good 
a job in business class. Each is now laboring to make its first class even 
better, because in many cases the improved business class now rivals first 
class on some other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Best Coach Seats: No award. In this category, things have actually gotten 
worse, not better. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanest Planes: Japan Airlines. Its flight attendants come as close to 
providing perfect service as possible. Can you name another airline where the 
flight attendants rush into the lavatories after each passenger has left to 
clean them? 
</P>
<P>
Best Domestic Airline: American Airlines. It still has a deserved reputation 
for consistency of service and one of the best route structures in the United 
States. It is also an airline that is rapidly expanding to Europe through new 
U.S. gateways like Raleigh-Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Western Winner 
</P>
<P>
Best Regional Airline: Alaska Airlines. The airline, based in Seattle, offers 
great in-flight food, good on-time performance, clean airplanes and some of the 
nicest, most helpful flight attendants I've ever met. In case you haven't flown 
the airline, Alaska flies to 32 cities in the United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Best International Airline: a three-way tie among Singapore Airlines, Thai 
International and SAS. 
</P>
<P>
Best Domestic Airport: a three-way tie. If you define a great airport as (1) 
convenient, (2) efficient and (3) passenger-friendly, then kudos must go to the 
airports in Oakland, Kansas City and Tampa. They are distinctly uncrowded, well 
designed and pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Best International Airport: Schiphol, in Amsterdam. It defines the word 
efficiency. And, if you like duty-free shopping, this is your place. Honorable 
mention: Changi Airport in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
The Humanitarian Travel Award: Doubletree Hotels. Again this year, the hotel 
chain will provide free short-term lodging for those in need during this 
holiday season. The chain's Room at the Inn program is offered to individuals 
and families visiting loved ones in out-of-town hospitals, and runs each year 
from Thanksgiving through New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Honorable mention to Clark Howard, a retired travel agency owner. Earlier this 
year, Eastern Airlines had a special promotion for its 60th birthday. The 
offer: People who flew the airline 60 times in 60 days would get 60 free 
tickets. Eastern never thought anyone would take them up on the offer. But 
Howard did -- and won, then gave the tickets to several charities in Georgia so 
that local needy children could take their first plane ride as well as enjoy a 
California vacation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacation Tips 
</P>
<P>
The Safe Travel Award: Westin Maui. You can thank the hotel, or perhaps its 
attorneys, for this, but thanks are due to the hotel for providing truly useful 
information about the sun and surf. In a pamphlet distributed to its arriving 
guests, the hotel gives specific tanning advice: "Spend a short time in the sun 
during your first day or two and gradually build up during your stay." Some 
swimming advice: "Enter the ocean gradually and carefully. Breakers come in 
'sets' with spells of calm in between." Plus: "Never turn your back to the 
ocean." If this seems like basic common sense, it is. But remember, most 
visitors to Maui don't live near the water, nor do they enjoy year-round 
sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
The Thoughtful Hotel Award: a tie, between the Hyatt Key West Hotel and 
Stouffer Hotels and Resorts. Earlier this year, when the Key West International 
Airport needed a face lift, but there was no county budget for the project, the 
Hyatt Key West hotel staff donated their time and repainted the terminal. 
Stouffer wins for abandoning a long-standing rip-off in the hotel business. The 
chain correctly identified a major traveler complaint, and dropped surcharges 
on credit-card phone calls, collect calls and calls to toll-free 800 numbers. 
Three cheers to Stouffer; it's about time. Honorable mention to Hyatt Hotels, 
which has decided against using the more expensive alternative operator service 
(AOS) to supply its long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
The Thoughtful Airline Award: UTA French Airlines. In order to welcome 
Americans to France, folks who travel on a UTA Holidays trip will receive a 
"telecard" good for a free four-minute call to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom of Travel Award: to Japan. An agreement was just reached between 
the United States and Japan exempting most Americans from needing a visa to 
visit the country. Now, if we could only afford the visit! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And Just for Fun 
</P>
<P>
There are also some unusual award winners: 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Best Travel Lawsuit Award: to the case of the sunburned buns. A court 
in Madison, Wis., heard the story of the woman who stayed in the artificial sun 
a little too long. The woman sued a local tanning salon, claiming she suffered 
second-degree burns that ruined her vacation in Jamaica by making it impossible 
to bask on the beach. She won. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, the 1988 Best Retort to a Lost Travel Lawsuit Award: to Robert 
Hazard, president and chief executive officer of Quality International. The 
company was sued by McDonald's after it announced its intention to use the name 
"McSleep" for a chain of budget hotels. After McDonald's won the suit, Hazard 
announced the new chain would be called "Jack in the Sack." Actually, the new 
hotels will be called Sleep Inns. 
</P>
<P>
Merry Christmas.

ONE ENCHANTED DAY WHEN PETER RABBIT STIRRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The names Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail have never figured very large in my 
adult vocabulary. Not that they weren't there. They were just too deep in 
memory for easy retrieval. 
</P>
<P>
Your average semi-macho guys, or even us everyday garden variety couch 
potatoes, just don't tend to hang onto those memories we formed before being 
checked out on two-wheel bikes. Unless we've had a refresher course. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I recently had a refresher course. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, we were in the Lake District of Cumbria -- which is about hip 
high on the British Isles -- and having a pretty good time. There aren't a 
whole lot of places on this earth as pretty or as peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Lakes 
</P>
<P>
We were told there are 23 lakes. Someone else said there are 19, so I suspect 
the total number sort of depends on whether or not it rained recently. I do 
know that however many there are, they're in one of the most awe-inspiring 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
Mile after mile of rolling meadows, forests and mountains, their tops 
frequently lost in cloud. There are fields of wildflowers, waterfalls and about 
every green that nature's got. 
</P>
<P>
There are sheep -- armies of sheep, eating as fast as they can but never 
catching up with the growing landscape. And there's something else . . . a 
feeling that goes with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and I were talking with Paul Carlin, a friend who'd come to the Lake 
District from London to manage the Borrowdale Gates Hotel near Keswick. He 
grinned as we raved about the countryside, as proud as if he'd created it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visitors From All Over 
</P>
<P>
"It's truly unique, you know, and I know what you mean about the feeling," 
Carlin said. "People come to the Lake District from your Wisconsin and 
Minnesota, where lakes are common. 
</P>
<P>
"Even from Colorado and British Columbia, whose mountains and lakes dwarf what 
we have here. And they're just as enchanted as everyone else. And I think I 
know the reason. It's not the lakes, you know." 
</P>
<P>
"What is it?" Joyce asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Carlin said, "I'm almost afraid to talk about it." He leaned forward 
and lowered his voice. "It may be something left over from the Druids or 
Merlin's time, but I think it's magic. I really believe there is a kind of 
enchantment here." 
</P>
<P>
We'd almost come to that conclusion on our own. You can't drive through the 
area without having that thought. We'd recently visited Dove Cottage, where 
William Wordsworth lived with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Though the cottage looks as if it's 300 years old, it's really kind of 
commonplace. The most unusual thing about it is that the children's rooms are 
wallpapered with newspapers. (The guidebook said Wordsworth thought it would 
make the rooms warmer in the winter.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setting Is Unusual 
</P>
<P>
But it's not the cottage, it's the setting that makes it unusual. When you see 
the view from the room where Wordsworth did his writing, you begin to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
You see Lake Grasmere cupped in rolling green hills, as still and reflecting as 
a mirror. The morning we were there, a few clouds were all but settling on its 
surface; you could feel a bit of the magic. 
</P>
<P>
There was no way a man of Wordsworth's talents could have lived in the area 
without becoming what he was -- a poet laureate, the greatest poet on nature 
that England has produced. 
</P>
<P>
"Wordsworth? Yes," Carlin said. " 'Lucy,' 'The Solitary Reaper' and 'Daffodils' 
are very nice. And you'll never convince me that James Hilton didn't spend some 
time here before he wrote about Shangri-La in 'Lost Horizon,' but I was 
thinking more in terms of Peter, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail." 
</P>
<P>
"Who?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Rabbit!" Joyce exclaimed. "That's right! Beatrix Potter lived here in 
the Lake Country, didn't she?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Missed House 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I meant by enchantment," Carlin said. "Her house is just down the 
way. I'll jot down some directions for you." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't "just down the way" at all. It was a couple of lakes and a few dozen 
turns down a long road, but the trip wasn't a chore, because the country itself 
was satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
We missed the house the first time and had to backtrack. We'd have missed it 
again, except a small sign said, "Hill Top House," which my wife recognized 
from the stories. 
</P>
<P>
At first there didn't seem to be any true personality about the place. Slowly 
the lady herself, Beatrix Potter, began to take form as our guide walked us 
through the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"It's patterned after Mr. McGregor's garden," she said. "Does that ring a 
bell?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Interested 
</P>
<P>
It meant something to most of the visitors, including Joyce, whose interest in 
the garden was suddenly aroused. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's McGregor?" I asked. "Refresh my memory." 
</P>
<P>
No one answered. They were all listening as the guide led us into the house. 
She explained how Miss Potter had lived in an era that expected all proper 
young women to go from their father's house to their husband's. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrix, a very average-looking young lady who spent a good part of her 
growing-up years in the sparsely settled area, had been alone a lot. Having few 
callers and a great deal of time, she had taken to sketching and writing 
stories about the things she knew and loved, like the countryside and some of 
its inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was a very young rabbit, whom she named Peter. It wasn't much of a 
story. It dealt with Peter leaving his siblings -- Flopsy, Mopsy and 
Cottontail, who were "good little bunnies" -- and going out and losing the new 
coat his mother had made him. 
</P>
<P>
He lost it when he was almost caught by Mr. McGregor, whose garden Peter had 
been told never to visit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Edition 
</P>
<P>
In 1902, probably more on the strength of the sketches than the stories, a 
London publisher took a chance and brought out a limited edition of "The Tale 
of Peter Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
There were no limitations from then on. Beatrix Potter wrote and illustrated 
more than 25 children's books, which were published in dozens of languages, to 
the delight of millions of children. And then their children and their 
children's children. 
</P>
<P>
"Did Beatrix Potter have children of her own?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
"She eventually married a man named William Heelis," the guide answered, "but 
she was childless." 
</P>
<P>
A woman asked if Miss Potter had been able to enjoy any of her success, or 
whether fame had only come after her death. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very canny lady who enjoyed huge success and made a great deal of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purchased Land 
</P>
<P>
The tour group grew silent. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact," said the guide, "she loved the district so, that to have some 
control over what might happen to it, she began slowly buying up more and more 
property in the area to keep it from being destroyed by what the world calls 
'progress.' 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to her writing, she spent her time working to protect all of this 
part of Cumbria, to keep it pure and unspoiled for all time. Her efforts are 
largely responsible for the fact that this whole district is now under the 
protection of the National Trust. God willing, and thanks to Beatrix Potter, it 
may be protected forever." 
</P>
<P>
The tour ended and we left the house, a few feet behind a young family. As we 
entered the garden again, a bird flew out of the hedge just in front of us. The 
daughter of the family, a girl of perhaps 4 or 5, heard the rustling noise and 
turned quickly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thought She Saw Him 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, papa," she said excitedly. The mother and father stopped and turned. The 
little girl spoke excitedly to her parents in a language neither Joyce nor I 
could understand. Her father answered her and then smiled at us. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to know was that Peter Rabbit who just came out of the bushes. I 
told her I didn't know because I had not seen." 
</P>
<P>
The little girl thought for a few seconds and then, nodding her head firmly, 
spoke again. Her father translated. 
</P>
<P>
"She says she thinks it was Peter Rabbit, that she thinks she caught a glimpse 
of him." The little girl ran around looking under rose bushes and behind hedges 
for another glimpse as we approached the gate cottage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interesting Theory 
</P>
<P>
Almost as a conspirator, the father shared a final thought with his wife and 
with us. "It probably was not really Peter Rabbit, you know. That rabbit would 
be 85 years old now." He winked. "Probably one of his children or his 
grandchildren, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Carlin stopped by our dinner table in the hotel dining room that night and 
asked if we'd made it to Hill Top House and what we thought of his theory. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't tell us what the lady had done for the district." 
</P>
<P>
"Or," Joyce said, "that it was Peter Rabbit that really started it all." 
</P>
<P>
"And, I'll bet," Carlin said, "that they told you Beatrix Potter never had any 
children, too." 
</P>
<P>
"You mean she did?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, she had millions of children . . . generations of millions 
of children," he said. "And didn't she leave them a lovely garden to play in?"

Letter From England 
</P>
<P>
From Mary Evans of Great Britain: "I would dearly love to visit California, and 
preferably not as a 'package tourist.' So I'm wondering whether any of your 
readers would like to exchange a holiday with me? I'm a divorced, Irish-born 
woman in my early 50s. Self-employed and had my own antique shop for some 
years. Would be delighted to take my exchange visitor out to London, antique 
shops, country houses and show her (or him) around. I live 45 miles from 
London." 
</P>
<P>
The idea is for the Californian, in turn, to host Mrs. Evans in the United 
States. Her address: 97 Newport Road, Woburn Sands, Milton Keynes, England MK17 
8UN. 
</P>

If Harlowe wants to see the real Soviet Union she should stay away from cities 
like Moscow and Leningrad. They represent their country as much as Tijuana and 
Juarez represent Mexico. Moscow and Leningrad have been set up to appeal to 
Western tourists. Mostly everything in these cities has been carefully 
orchestrated to create a positive image. I was born and raised in Moscow, so I 
am very much aware of how this system has been set up. If Harlowe wants her 
eyes opened she should see towns outside of the mainstream -- if she can get 
permission.

Obviously Harlowe had not stopped in other cities than Moscow and Leningrad, 
for instance Smolensk, Zagorsk, Kalinin and Yaroslavl in the Russian Republic. 
If you really want some fun, see what happens when you land in Lviv, Odessa, 
Ternopil or Kaniv in the Ukrainian Republic. As an exchange student who 
recently finished studies in the Soviet Union, I can tell you that if you 
believe in glasnost, then I have a bridge to sell you.

I want to comment on the letter from Beverly Harlowe, who wrote about her 
positive experience with customs in Moscow and Leningrad, "Different Customs" 
(Nov. 27). As a person who is working in the Soviet Union (I am stateside on 
vacation), I can tell you that what foreigners experience in Leningrad, Moscow, 
Kiev and other "show" cities is not a true picture. 
</P>
<P>
I work as a translator to an American delegation, so I get to travel into areas 
where no American has ever set foot. Some of these areas are strategically 
off-limits to foreigners. Thus, I get to see the Soviet Union as it really is. 
</P>
<P>
Most of your readers have no idea what the real Soviet Union is like. They 
spend two weeks in tourist cities and they become instant experts. Glasnost is 
something that has been developed to appease the Western world. In reality 
there has been very little change. In cities where Westerners, particularly 
Americans, are accommodated, a show of glasnost is put on because the Soviets 
want that image to be taken back to the United States and shared with 
non-travelers.

Toni Taylor's article, "Agents Take a Beating" (Dec. 11), was the nicest thing 
that could have been written about the lonely life of a travel agent and the 
sometimes abuse we get from the travel industry whose livelihood really depends 
on us. I entered the travel field 41 years ago, and lots of changes have taken 
place in that time. But never have I read an article that was so concise and 
informative about the travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you for printing it. Please thank Toni Taylor for writing it. Also, 
thanks for providing your readers with an informative travel section. Without 
it, the public and travel agent would not be as well informed as we are now.

INSIGHTFUL COMMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
BLIND TWIN BROTHERS GIVE SIGHTLESS RADIO LISTENERS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF ROSE 
PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While millions watch as television personalities describe the visual wonders 
passing before them in Pasadena on Monday, a pair of blind radio commentators 
will offer their own view of the Tournament of Roses. 
</P>
<P>
John and Larry Gassman, who have never seen the parade, will broadcast live for 
the third time from high in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier twins, who coincidentally will celebrate their 34th birthday 
Monday, will begin their coverage of the parade at 8 a.m. on KPCC, Pasadena 
City College's radio station, a program that will be carried all over the 
country via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sighted Listeners, Too 
</P>
<P>
Experienced broadcasters who have had their own 2-hour show on KPCC since 1980, 
the men do their parade commentary especially for a blind audience. 
</P>
<P>
After much preparation, including "feeling tours" of floats under construction, 
they describe the parade in terms that are understandable to other sightless 
people. They often refer to textures of float materials and to sizes and shapes 
they have felt. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Shirk, program director of KPCC who also serves as the Gassmans' 
spotter during the parade, said plenty of sighted people listen as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had so many people say they get sick and tired of the patter on 
television, and they turn down the sound on their sets and turn on the radio," 
Shirk said. He called the twins "extremely intelligent, with marvelous senses 
of humor.' 
</P>
<P>
Shirk said about 30 other public radio stations usually pick up the broadcast 
via satellite. KPCC is at 89.3 on FM radio and is the parade's "informational" 
station, Shirk said, giving weather, parking and traffic information before and 
after the parade broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
As on the past two New Year's Days, the twins will climb 65 feet to the 
broadcasting booth before 6 a.m. Monday. While others look down on Orange Grove 
and Colorado Boulevards through early morning darkness and frost, they rub 
their freezing fingertips across pages of Braille notes. 
</P>
<P>
Citing their biggest problem, John Gassman said, "When our fingertips freeze, 
the Braille becomes fuzzy. That's like reading a printed page and the lights go 
out. We tried last year to wear gloves with the fingertips cut out, but they 
still froze. Now we're going to try a portable lamp with heat. Actually, it's 
fun to figure out what to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transcribe Into Braille 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the parade, the men tape press releases that are read aloud 
and then transcribe the tapes into Braille. Then they tape their observations 
while they tour the floats, literally getting a feel of their sizes and 
textures. In combining all of the material, they said they are prepared for 
every possible delay or mishap and always have much more background information 
and details than they have ever needed. 
</P>
<P>
In acting as spotter, Shirk joins them in their broadcast booth to describe 
anything that might occur in the parade that is not in the official lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"He tells us to speed up or slow down," John said. "Anyone knows that when 
you're describing a float and a band goes by, there's something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
They said their style is to talk to each other during the broadcast, 
questioning and answering to "keep it conversational." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be talking to people, not at them," John said. "Talking at people 
is an easy trap to fall into. We try to stay away from sounding like we're 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
"If we use humor, it's not conscious, but if there's something funny and its in 
good taste, well. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weekly Program 
</P>
<P>
They have had years of practice, anticipating each other's comments and keeping 
up a lively patter. 
</P>
<P>
Their weekly radio show, "Same Time, Same Station," is on KPCC every Sunday 
from 6 to 8 p.m., when they replay old radio programs from their collection of 
13,000 that include Jack Benny, Bob Hope, "Suspense" and "Fibber McGee and 
Molly." Sometimes they interview writers or directors of the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Their collection is what John called "medium-sized, but all high-quality" 
recordings of the old programs. It began as a hobby and is continually growing 
as the men buy and trade with other collectors all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
They are identical twins who live together in their own home in Whittier, where 
they grew up and attended public schools. They are graduates of Rio Hondo 
College, where their interest in radio began when they began serving as hosts 
of a "Top 40s" show on the college radio station in the early 1970s. They are 
not employed, but hope their interest in radio, which is now a hobby, will lead 
to jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Nature 
</P>
<P>
They said their parents, both of whom have died, "purposely taught us that we 
were just like anyone else, so being blind was just second nature." 
</P>
<P>
They were born more than two months premature, and within three minutes of each 
other, John weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces, and Larry 1 pound, 10 ounces. As with 
many premature babies born during the 1950s, they were permanently blinded by 
excessive amounts of oxygen pumped into their incubators to help keep them 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never been anything but blind, so we never thought about it," Larry 
said. "We just learned to adapt and make the best of it. We're not negative 
people anyway." 
</P>
<P>
They said they have had responses to their parade commentary from people all 
over the country, not all of them blind. 
</P>
<P>
"No negative feedback, as far as we know," John said.

2 AGENCIES STRIVE TO TAKE OVER PEST ABATEMENT IN L.B. 
</P>

LONG BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what is developing into a territorial skirmish over mosquitoes, two 
government agencies are swatting at each other over which of them would do a 
better job of combating the city's mosquito population. 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Mosquito Abatement District, which oversees mosquito control in 
the central and northeastern sections of the city, wants authority over 
mosquitoes in the rest of Long Beach -- now the province of the city Department 
of Health and Human Services. District officials contend the health department 
is too busy fighting other public health threats, such as rats, to pay 
sufficient heed to mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
Local health officials have, for their part, taken umbrage at the suggestion 
that mosquitoes are running wild in their part of the city. They retort that 
the abatement district is attempting to justify its mosquito grab with 
error-strewn allegations that the city's equipment, pesticides and vigilance 
are inferior. 
</P>
<P>
The district has long wanted to bring Long Beach under one anti-mosquito 
umbrella -- its own. Formed in 1952, the regional district assumed 
responsibility for what was then unincorporated county land in the Long Beach 
area. When the city annexed the land, the district retained mosquito 
jurisdiction, leaving Long Beach divided as far as mosquitoes were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Communities Served 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the city of Signal Hill, surrounded by Long Beach, is in the 
district, as are the cities to the north of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We do a very extensive and thorough job of mosquito control," Jack Hazelrigg, 
the district's assistant manager and entomologist, said. While the city "does a 
good job," Hazelrigg added, "we can do a better job." 
</P>
<P>
The district's sole purpose in life is to keep mosquitoes in check, Hazelrigg 
stressed. It does that in 32 cities in Los Angeles County, along with 
unincorporated parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Diana M. Bonta, recently appointed director of the Long Beach Department of 
Health and Human Services, says she has no vested interest in guarding the 
city's mosquito turf. Nonetheless, she says she was disheartened at some of the 
district's contentions and feels compelled to correct them. 
</P>
<P>
She also points out that it would cost residents slightly more if they switched 
to the district, and she argues that a local, rather than a regional agency, is 
more likely to be responsive to residents' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The arbiter of the matter, the City Council, has referred the district's 
annexation request to its Public Safety Committee, which is holding hearings on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Undecided on Changes 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I haven't found the city to be wanting," Councilman Ray Grabinski, 
the committee's chairman, said. Grabinski, whose West Long Beach district falls 
under the city's jurisdiction, hastened to add that he had not decided whether 
any changes were in order. 
</P>
<P>
The move to bring all of Long Beach into the district was bolstered last summer 
when West Long Beach residents were tormented by swarms of midges, gnat-like, 
flying insects that do not bite, but do bother people. "You didn't want to open 
your mouth to breathe," said Dan Cangro of the Wrigley Assn., a neighborhood 
group that complained to the council that the city's bug-control efforts were 
not all they might be. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been our contention that if we were under the mosquito (district) 
program, we wouldn't have these problems. . . . The city has been pretty good, 
but it's been on a case-by-case basis," he said, arguing that the health 
department has neither the time nor the staff to devote as much attention to 
mosquito control as does the district. 
</P>
<P>
Bonta, pointing out that midges are largely the responsibility of county flood 
control authorities, says residents are mistaken if they think the district 
will eliminate the midge nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
The district is funded with annual property tax assessments of a couple of 
dollars on every parcel within the district. It would therefore not cost the 
city anything to relinquish its mosquito duties to the district. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, also on the Public Safety Committee, 
argues that however small the fee, it will cost residents something. "I'm not 
particularly receptive to turning it over to the abatement district," said 
Braude, whose shoreline district is within the health department's territory. 
He, too, says he is satisfied with the department's mosquito performance, 
although he agrees that a case can be made for consolidating mosquito control 
efforts in the city. 
</P>
<P>
It costs the health department about $24,000 a year to run its mosquito 
program, a sum that would likely be spent on some other city expense were it 
not used on mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Public Safety Committee last month, Bonta complained that 
much of the district's information about the city's program "is simply 
incorrect." For instance, she said that contrary to the district's assertions, 
the department routinely sprays mosquito breeding areas and also uses 
biological controls, such as mosquito fish, which consume mosquito larvae. 
</P>
<P>
Bonta further argues that since it is necessary for her department to monitor 
mosquito-borne diseases, the city should continue to wage some of Long Beach's 
mosquito battles. It might even make sense to have the city take over the third 
of Long Beach now treated by the district, she said, adding that the costs of 
that move are being researched.

RESPONSE TIME OF PASADENA POLICE SHORT OF 6-MINUTE GOAL 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city audit has concluded that police failed to respond to emergency calls 
within the department goal of six minutes nearly half the time during a recent 
7-month monitoring period. 
</P>
<P>
A manpower shortage was cited as the reason in the audit by city administrators 
and outside consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The audit also concluded that the Police Department should eliminate two of its 
four helicopters and consider transferring some of the officers from a special 
neighborhood crime task force to other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
According to the audit, officers did not meet the departmental goal of 
responding within six minutes to crimes that are life-threatening or in 
progress 48% of the time between July, 1987, and February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The average delay was one second more than six minutes. Response times ranged 
from 3 minutes, 16 seconds to 16 minutes, 26 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
During the monitoring period, the department had about 56 officers on patrol 
and was about 10 below the staffing level approved by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What I don't understand is why can't we fill those positions?" asked city 
Director Kathryn Nack. "We have the money, why don't we have the people?" 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief James M. Robenson said the department has had a difficult time 
finding officers. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is difficult to find qualified candidates since only about one in 75 
is accepted. Many potential applicants prefer to work on smaller suburban 
forces, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena has tried to solve the problem by recruiting on college campuses 
around the country and setting up a toll-free telephone number to provide 
employment information, Robenson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Robenson said the audit was wrong in assuming the shortage has affected the 
department's response time to emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
He said those calls are given top priority and even if a dozen new officers 
were hired, it would not significantly lower response times. More patrol 
officers, he said, would have a greater impact on less serious calls, which are 
sometimes delayed while police respond to emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
Robenson also said the audit was misleading because it did not count the 
response time of police helicopters, which he said can reach the scene of any 
crime in the city in less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
He added that even if the audit were accurate, a delay of a few seconds was 
still well within an acceptable range. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I'd like to have the quickest response of any place, but we're talking 
about just a few seconds," he said. "If the trend is between six and seven 
minutes, I feel we're delivering at least what we should." 
</P>
<P>
Police in Pomona, which is comparable to Pasadena in population, has an average 
response time of 7 minutes, 50 seconds. Pomona has 94 patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
The audit, which will be presented to the Board of Directors Jan. 10, was part 
of a series of reports commissioned by the city to study the operation of all 
its major departments, such as water and power and public works. 
</P>
<P>
The audit largely praised the Police Department for its responsiveness to the 
community and innovative approach to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pasadena Police Department can be classified as an organization on the 
move," the audit stated. "Based on our analysis, the project team found no 
major efficiency or effectiveness problems." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William Thomson said he was pleased with the results of the audit, saying 
it confirmed his belief that "we have a first-rate department." 
</P>
<P>
But Director William Paparian said the audit's conclusions led him to believe 
the department has gotten away from the basics of law enforcement to pursue 
"sexier" and more high-profile projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to be going to more substance than flash," he said. "We've gone off 
on these sexy approaches and I think it's time we get back to the basics." 
</P>
<P>
One example, Paparian said, was the Neighborhood Crime Task Force, a special 
police unit formed to fight neighborhood crime and drug dealing, particularly 
in northwest Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The audit praised the task force for its high number of arrests and 
convictions, but noted the number of felony and drug arrests have dropped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Implications for Task Force 
</P>
<P>
The audit team, which included city administrators and outside consultants, 
said the smaller number of arrests for serious crimes may be the first sign the 
3-year-old task force has outlived its usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
The audit recommended the department consider transferring some of the task 
force's 18 officers to other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But Robenson said cutting back the task force would be a "disservice" to the 
northwest community, which still has the highest crime rate in the city. 
</P>
<P>
While the number of felony and drug arrests did drop by about 20% during an 
18-month period ending in 1987, the number of cases filed for prosecution 
remained the same, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
Robenson said the task force allows the department to focus on combatting crime 
in the neighborhoods by freeing up officers for foot patrols throughout the 
city and undercover drug enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helicopter Unit 
</P>
<P>
The audit also raised concerns about the efficiency of the department's 
helicopter unit, which auditors said has more helicopters than it needs. 
</P>
<P>
The unit now has four helicopters, one of which is primarily used to ferry city 
officials and demonstrate the capabilities of helicopters to police officers. 
Other cities of comparable size have two helicopters to accomplish the same 
work, according to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we need to have our own air force with a budget of $1.1 
million," Paparian said. "I'd like to see us spend that money on 
bread-and-butter stuff like more neighborhood patrols." 
</P>
<P>
The audit recommended selling two of the helicopters for an annual savings of 
as much as $640,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Robenson said to achieve those savings the department would have to 
eliminate daytime flights and cut back flight time from 3,750 hours a year to 
1,170. 
</P>
<P>
He said the department is spending about the same as other departments that 
have just two helicopters. For example, he said, Riverside police spent $1.3 
million and Newport police spent $900,000 last year to operate two helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Robenson said having four helicopters is critical to the department's patrol 
strategy because they can reach the scene of a crime faster than a patrol car 
and can cover much more territory.

SANTA FE SPRINGS FIRMS CREATE AID NETWORK UNDER EMERGENCY PLAN 
</P>

SANTA FE SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the dust from the Whittier Narrows earthquake on Oct. 1, 1987, finally 
settled, city officials began hearing from concerned business owners. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake knocked out telephone service, preventing the city's 3,500 
businesses from reporting emergencies such as fires and medical problems. The 
nearly 80,000 workers who commute to Santa Fe Springs daily clogged streets for 
hours. At one point it took nearly 2 hours for a city fire truck to travel 
about 3 miles from the fire station to City Hall, said Fire Chief Robert 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"Communications were terrible," Wilson said. "We were overwhelmed. We really 
had no idea what was going on in the city." 
</P>
<P>
The safety and satisfaction of the business community is especially important 
in Santa Fe Springs, where 85% of the land is zoned for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
"In the daytime, we could have major problems just dealing with the numbers of 
people" who work here, said Assistant City Manager Fred Latham. "And if this 
were to occur at night, we could have unoccupied buildings with substantial 
damage and not be aware of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Partnership Formed 
</P>
<P>
As a result of these concerns, the public and private sectors in Santa Fe 
Springs have formed a partnership to design an emergency-preparedness plan that 
would reduce the burden on city government in the three days after a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe Springs Chamber of Commerce suggested that businesses establish 
their own emergency communications network. City officials agreed, and in the 
past year the chamber's suggestion has evolved into an elaborate plan. Though 
supervised by the city, businesses will turn to one another instead of the city 
when disaster strikes. 
</P>
<P>
With just 15,000 residents concentrated in a 2-square-mile area, the best 
option for Santa Fe Springs is to rely on businesses in the other seven square 
miles of town to provide their own emergency support, said Tony Ferrara, a 
supervisor at the California Specialized Training Institute. The institute is a 
division of the state Office of Emergency Services which is helping a committee 
of city and chamber officials prepare the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The city told the businesses, 'We don't have the traditional support systems. 
So you are it,' " Ferrara said. "This was a tremendous buy-in on the part of 
industry . . . and the city was willing to depart from the norm as far as their 
association with the private sector. What they are doing is making use of what 
they have, and what they have is industry." 
</P>
<P>
If an earthquake were to happen once the city's plan is in place, this is how 
businesses would respond: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Command Posts 
</P>
<P>
They would immediately report to one of four command posts, where an area 
coordinator would report any emergencies to city officials by radio. Workers on 
foot or riding bicycles would check neighboring businesses for injured 
employees or other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Once damages are assessed, workers would turn to a handbook to see where 
emergency supplies are available. Under the cooperative plan, a food warehouse 
might agree to donate food and another firm might provide blankets or plywood 
for boarding up broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
"We are asking businesses to go beyond their own walls and hold hands," Latham 
said. "It's really exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Once post-disaster emergencies have been taken care of, the plan calls for 
businesses to resume operations quickly. For example, a business using propane 
might not be able to reach a supplier in Los Angeles, so the plan would include 
a list of propane suppliers in the immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
"An important element is getting the businesses running again," Wilson said. 
"They're producing resources that can be used for the recovery effort." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disaster Assistance 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for familiarizing business owners with government disaster 
assistance loans and grants. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Landis, president of the Santa Fe Springs Chamber of Commerce, said the 
plan has met with an enthusiastic reception from the business community. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of resources in this city, and most businesses are willing to 
share them," Landis said. "We're going to wind up with a business community 
that is really well prepared. . . . We feel we are on the cutting edge of 
emergency preparedness." 
</P>
<P>
It will be about three years before the system is completely in place, Latham 
said. Next month, the chamber plans to mail questionnaires to all Santa Fe 
Springs businesses, requesting their participation and outlining information 
about operating hours, existing emergency plans and other relevant facts, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1989, organizers plan to have the handbook distributed and 
command posts set up. In 1990, they plan to complete training in disaster loan 
procedures, first aid and other emergency measures. Santa Fe Springs will 
assign one Fire Department employee to supervise the effort, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, impressed by the efforts of the business community, has asked 
city staff to develop a similar emergency response system for residential 
areas, Latham said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrara hopes that Santa Fe Springs' business network can become a model for 
other cities and counties with large industrial bases. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept is that over a period of time, there will be a network of 
communication and support," Latham said, "so when an emergency does occur, the 
relationships will automatically be in place."

REVIEWING THE 'CITY HALL CIRCUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo to The Times for printing the facts objectively about the mess in Long 
Beach resulting from unrestrained and unplanned development! 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Kell is typically being demagogic when he says there is "plenty of blame 
to go around" for the mushrooming apartment houses where single-family 
dwellings stood a few months ago. He and three other members of the City 
Council alone approved this sellout. What Kell really means is there is plenty 
of blame to try to spread around, which he is, of course, trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even Kell is exceeded in artful dodging by Councilwoman Jan Hall, who 
managed to lead both the city of Long Beach and the RTD into disaster 
simultaneously and then duck responsibility for both. 
</P>
<P>
Not mentioned in your coverage was the incredible ineptitude displayed by Kell, 
Hall and company, in the matter of the airport and the Pandora's box of noise 
and pollution that has opened up. While other cities have been going in the 
direction of placing airports away from city centers and population, our 
council, of course, is going in precisely the opposite direction and trying to 
expand one in a prime residential section of our city! 
</P>
<P>
One who has followed the City Hall circus would, of course, expect a "solution" 
from Kell and Hall for the parking problem they have created; they want to 
harass a tiny, politically unprotected minority of small boat owners who cause 
probably less than one-tenth of 1% of the problem ("Long Beach Thinks Again 
About Paving of Greenbelt," Times, Dec. 4). Thus they can continue to flail 
around while giving the superficial impression of doing something. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, to call the Long Beach Planning Department ineffectual is to be unduly 
charitable. They have proven themselves to be the Keystone Kops of urban 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
One fears the inmates are running the asylum. Please keep your spotlight 
focused; it may perchance do some good.

SIGHTLESS TWINS GIVE LISTENERS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF ROSE PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While millions watch as television personalities describe the visual wonders 
passing before them in Pasadena on Monday, a pair of blind radio commentators 
will offer their own view of the Tournament of Roses. 
</P>
<P>
John and Larry Gassman, who have never seen the parade, will broadcast live for 
the third time from high in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier twins, who coincidentally will celebrate their 34th birthday 
Monday, will begin their coverage of the parade at 8 a.m. on KPCC, Pasadena 
City College's radio station, a program that will be carried all over the 
country via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sighted Listeners, Too 
</P>
<P>
Experienced broadcasters who have had their own 2-hour show on KPCC since 1980, 
the men do their parade commentary especially for a blind audience. 
</P>
<P>
After much preparation, including "feeling tours" of floats under construction, 
they describe the parade in terms that are understandable to other sightless 
people. They often refer to textures of float materials and to sizes and shapes 
they have felt. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Shirk, program director of KPCC who also serves as the Gassmans' 
spotter during the parade, said plenty of sighted people listen as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had so many people say they get sick and tired of the patter on 
television, and they turn down the sound on their sets and turn on the radio," 
Shirk said. He called the twins "extremely intelligent, with marvelous senses 
of humor.' 
</P>
<P>
Shirk said about 30 other public radio stations usually pick up the broadcast 
via satellite. KPCC is at 89.3 on FM radio and is the parade's "informational" 
station, Shirk said, giving weather, parking and traffic information before and 
after the parade broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
As on the past two New Year's Days, the twins will climb 65 feet to the 
broadcasting booth before 6 a.m. Monday. While others look down on Orange Grove 
and Colorado Boulevards through early morning darkness and frost, they rub 
their freezing fingertips across pages of Braille notes. 
</P>
<P>
Citing their biggest problem, John Gassman said, "When our fingertips freeze, 
the Braille becomes fuzzy. That's like reading a printed page and the lights go 
out. We tried last year to wear gloves with the fingertips cut out, but they 
still froze. Now we're going to try a portable lamp with heat. Actually, it's 
fun to figure out what to do." 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the parade, the men tape press releases that are read aloud 
and then transcribe the tapes into Braille. Then they tape their observations 
while they tour the floats, literally getting a feel of their sizes and 
textures. In combining all of the material, they said they are prepared for 
every possible delay or mishap and always have much more background information 
and details than they have ever needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acting as Spotter 
</P>
<P>
In acting as spotter, Shirk joins them in their broadcast booth to describe 
anything that might occur in the parade that is not in the official lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"He tells us to speed up or slow down," John said. "Anyone knows that when 
you're describing a float and a band goes by, there's something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
They said their style is to talk to each other during the broadcast, 
questioning and answering to "keep it conversational." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be talking to people, not at them," John said. "Talking at people 
is an easy trap to fall into. We try to stay away from sounding like we're 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
"If we use humor, it's not conscious, but if there's something funny and its in 
good taste, well. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
They have had years of practice, anticipating each other's comments and keeping 
up a lively patter. 
</P>
<P>
Their weekly radio show, "Same Time, Same Station," is on KPCC every Sunday 
from 6 to 8 p.m., when they replay old radio programs from their collection of 
13,000 that include Jack Benny, Bob Hope, "Suspense" and "Fibber McGee and 
Molly." Sometimes they interview writers or directors of the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Their collection is what John called "medium-sized, but all high-quality" 
recordings of the old programs. It began as a hobby and is continually growing 
as the men buy and trade with other collectors all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
They are identical twins who live together in their own home in Whittier, where 
they grew up and attended public schools. They are graduates of Rio Hondo 
College, where their interest in radio began when they began serving as hosts 
of a "Top 40s" show on the college radio station in the early 1970s. They are 
not employed, but hope their interest in radio, which is now a hobby, will lead 
to jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Nature 
</P>
<P>
They said their parents, both of whom have died, "purposely taught us that we 
were just like anyone else, so being blind was just second nature." 
</P>
<P>
They were born more than two months premature, and within three minutes of each 
other, John weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces, and Larry 1 pound, 10 ounces. As with 
many premature babies born during the 1950s, they were permanently blinded by 
excessive amounts of oxygen pumped into their incubators to help keep them 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never been anything but blind, so we never thought about it," Larry 
said. "We just learned to adapt and make the best of it. We're not negative 
people anyway." 
</P>
<P>
They said they have had responses to their parade commentary from people all 
over the country, not all of them blind. 
</P>
<P>
"No negative feedback, as far as we know," John said.

LONG BEACH URGED TO HELP HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe for the New Year . . . the Long Beach city administration might . . . 
officially help the homeless in the Long Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
As an article in the Long Beach section showed (Times, Dec. 22), local 
restaurants, such as Vincent Williams' Golden Bird chicken outlets, donate food 
to the Long Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Other restaurants such as Justina's in downtown Long Beach, Domino's Pizza and 
Twin Wheels Steak House have jumped on the bandwagon in giving food to the Long 
Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
So when will the Long Beach City Council . . . jump on the bandwagon and take 
official action to help the homeless as recommended by the city's task force in 
1987? Will they do something in early 1989?

SUPER QUIZ DROPS 'CRUSOE' AFTER RACISM COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Robinson Crusoe" has been thrown overboard by the planners of the Los Angeles 
Unified School District's Sixth Annual Academic Pentathlon after a teacher 
complained about racial stereotyping in the literary classic. 
</P>
<P>
In October the district notified coaches preparing middle-school students for 
the districtwide academic competition that the Super Quiz would deal with 
Daniel Defoe's 18th-Century novel about shipwreck and survival. A few weeks 
later, the coaches were sent a memo saying the book had been withdrawn and 
replaced by Jules Verne's classic "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea." No reason was 
given for the change. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lorna Round, the district's associate superintendent of 
instruction, the Defoe book was dropped from the pentathlon after a coach in a 
predominantly black school objected to "the blatantly racist attitude pervasive 
throughout the book." Round declined to identify the coach, who is on winter 
break, without first obtaining his permission. 
</P>
<P>
Round said the coach had objected to passages such as the following description 
of Friday, the black man who ends Crusoe's decades of isolation: "He was a 
comely handsome fellow perfectly well made. . . . His hair was long and black, 
not curled like wool. . . . The color of his skin was not quite black . . . and 
yet not of an ugly yellow, nauseous tawny as the Brazilians . . . his nose 
small, not flat like the Negroes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Pulled From Shelves 
</P>
<P>
Round said the staff agreed with the coach's contention that "a book which 
reinforces negative racial stereotypes should not be the centerpiece of a 
districtwide competition." Round emphasized that the book had not been pulled 
from library shelves nor censored in any other way, only dropped from the list 
of material to be used in the competition. The pentathlon will be held Feb. 25 
at Fairfax High School. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying 'Don't read it,' " Round said. However, she said she and 
other staff members felt that, given the uncomplimentary characterization of 
blacks and other minorities in the book, it needed to be taught carefully. A 
specific concern, she said, was that the book's treatment of minorities might 
negatively affect the self-esteem of some minority students. 
</P>
<P>
Given the deadline imposed by the competition, she said, "we didn't feel we had 
time to talk to all the teachers (about ways the book might be constructively 
taught)." Round said the district hoped to develop a lesson plan for the book 
that would address the troublesome issues it raises. 
</P>
<P>
A few coaches called the district to protest the change in books, Round said. 
Most were distressed because they had already begun working with their students 
on "Robinson Crusoe." 
</P>
<P>
Both books are recommended for study by middle-school students by the state 
Department of Education. Janet R. Cole, a state education official, lauded the 
district for its handling of the matter. "I think it's wonderful that they are 
sensitive to the community. Both are excellent books. It doesn't matter which 
one they use."

SHOP OWNERS ARE PIONEERS IN REVIVING OLD WEST STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
MONTEREY FURNITURE RIDES BACK OUT OF SUNSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That low-slung, wooden couch with cushions covered in Mexican serapes is not 
cheesy: It's Monterey, Jack. 
</P>
<P>
What? You don't remember the style of furniture that filled working-class Los 
Angeles ranch houses in the 1930s and '40s, spread East with the lore of 
Westerns, then met an inglorious end in the rumpus room? 
</P>
<P>
Don't blame Don Shorts and Dolores Fisher. The proprietors of a Ventura 
antiques shop, they take credit for rekindling interest in Monterey furniture, 
which is decorated with wrought-iron hinges, hand-painted donkeys, flowers and 
sombrero-bedecked figures. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to be considered the pioneers in bringing this thing back to light," 
explained Shorts, 54, who co-owns the Old California Store on East Thompson 
Boulevard with Fisher, 55. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cowboy Style 
</P>
<P>
Others may have received more publicity for selling the factory-made furniture 
that Ojai collector Bob Smith describes as "a motion-picture version of what 
cowboys might have had in the way of furniture -- if they had furniture." 
</P>
<P>
But none of the handful of Monterey dealers has done more to research and 
promote a style whose history was little known 6 months ago, the couple's 
colleagues agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I would certainly give the most credit for the resurrection to Don and Dee," 
said Jack Moore, a Pasadena antiques dealer who for 7 years has traded in the 
furniture that combines early California, Mexican and Western influences. 
</P>
<P>
Shorts and Fisher have turned their 1926 home, which doubles as living quarters 
and a showroom, into a Monterey monument, with a rotating selection of dining 
room sets, bedroom sets, living room groupings, Mexican kitsch and at least 
three photographs of Will Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
They also publish a newsletter on the furniture, serve as hosts at "openings" 
in the homes of clients, and organize outings to such shrines of Monterey 
furniture as Rogers' 1921 ranch house in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
The couple even organized a museum exhibition last summer of the ersatz cowboy 
furniture. "Monterey: An Exhibition of California Rancho Furniture, Pottery and 
Art" filled one story and part of a second at the Santa Monica Heritage Museum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Introduction 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition enhanced the furniture's status as a collectible by popularizing 
it, antiques dealers say. It also introduced the style to Kenneth Trapp, a 
curator of decorative arts at the Oakland Museum. Now he plans to include it in 
an upcoming exhibition of California Craftsman furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"It struck me as wonderfully ludicrous," Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
And so it is. Consider the chaise lounge done up frontier-style, with a canvas 
canopy to complete the covered-wagon look. Or the grand piano fashioned out of 
wood so rough-hewn that it looks as if it had been dragged through a mountain 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 2 years, the Westward-ho look has become Westward-haute. Magazines 
such as Metropolitan Home and Better Homes and Gardens have praised Monterey 
furniture, tony Los Angeles shops have taken to selling it, and one shop even 
peddles modern-day reproductions of it. 
</P>
<P>
The limelight also has fallen on the designer of the Monterey line, George 
Mason, an 81-year-old retiree now living in San Luis Obispo. Instead of making 
couches and chairs, these days Mason occupies himself with painting, and lately 
his favorite subject has been his own rediscovered furniture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paintings Exhibited 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in December, Shorts and Fisher mounted an exhibition of the folksy 
paintings at their store. Mason's painted renditions of Monterey furniture sold 
briskly for as much as $185 apiece, while about 50 collectors competed for his 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I came down from Pismo Beach just to shake his hand," gushed Patricia Slater, 
53, a designer of what she described as "cowboy punk" furniture. 
</P>
<P>
It almost seemed like the good old days to Mason, whose father ran the Los 
Angeles factory where his designs were made. In 1929, executives of Barker 
Brothers Furniture asked the pair to design and manufacture a line that would 
bear the Monterey name and would suit the ranch houses springing up all over 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Masons were told to take their cue from a settee that appeared in the 
background of a Warner Brothers movie, "Old Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
Made from Oregon alder, stained in six colors and shaped into about 120 pieces, 
each quirkier than the last one, the furniture was a hit, as were a host of 
copycat lines: La Fiesta, Coronado, Ranch-O. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey-style furniture spread to homes in Texas, New York, Chicago and 
Florida. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Changing Times 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, Mason was drafted; his father died, and Monterey came to a grinding 
halt. After the war, tastes changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone threw it out and got chrome and glass," said Betty Gold, who stocked 
her much-publicized Melrose Avenue furniture shop, Territory, with Monterey 
purchased from Shorts and Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
The distinctive furniture became, as one collector says, "grist for garage 
sales." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Shorts, who 10 years ago quit his job as a high school history teacher in 
Santa Barbara to devote himself full-time to his hobby of collecting old 
paintings and furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
The homemade crafts and pottery that sold at roadside stands throughout 
Southern California in the 1930s had begun to attract his attention. Typically 
decorated with sombrero-topped men either asleep beneath cactuses or leading 
stubborn mules, they reminded him of his South Gate childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a '30s Southern California child and have never outgrown it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shorts discovered Monterey furniture and liked how well it matched the 
knickknacks he was acquiring. 
</P>
<P>
He bought the furniture first for himself, because he did not think it would 
sell. In fact, it was not until 2 years ago that the shop began to deal 
exclusively in Monterey-style furniture and its trappings. Since then, sales 
have tripled, he said, and he delves into a network of thrift shops and 
secondhand stores to replenish his stock. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, Shorts was not sure until recently what he was selling. He 
had noticed that the pieces were all branded with the same label -- "Monterey" 
-- but unraveling their origins proved difficult. 
</P>
<P>
One person told him that the furniture came from Monterrey, Mexico. No, another 
said, Monterey, Calif. But a Monterey, Calif., antiques dealer put that notion 
to rest. "Oh, that's what we call Carmel furniture," she told him. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until a friend found an old Barker Brothers catalogue that Shorts 
had a tangible lead. Lacking details, however, Shorts wrongly concluded that 
the company had manufactured the furniture, not merely sold it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Error Noted 
</P>
<P>
Mason, the furniture's real manufacturer, noted the error when he read an 
article about the Santa Monica exhibition. "It made me so angry," remembers 
Mason, who complained to the museum's director, Tobi Smith. She was only too 
happy to hear from him. 
</P>
<P>
Smith enlisted both Mason and Shorts to write chapters in an upcoming catalogue 
of the exhibition, which will include an essay by Smith's husband, Bob, the 
Ojai collector, who also teaches furniture design at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "My Mexicana Nirvana," Bob Smith's piece hails the furniture as "a 
unique manifestation of Western urban culture." 
</P>
<P>
"Woven with mythology, fantasy, eclecticism and pretension, Monterey furniture 
is synonymous with Southern Californians' collective search for a meaningful 
identity -- a population with no heritage and little in common," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Smith believes that modern furniture buyers are attracted to Monterey 
because it tickles the modern fancy. 
</P>
<P>
"As an unabashedly eclectic and nostalgic movement, Postmodernism says it's all 
right to borrow style or fake material if you are honest about it," he said. 
And "Monterey Furniture is honestly fake." 
</P>
<P>
Even honestly fake furniture comes with a price. A dining room set sells for 
$3,500 at the California shop, which is still less expensive than a fine chair 
from the Arts and Crafts Movement but is much more than the $79 Mason remembers 
the same pieces selling for originally. 
</P>
<P>
But for collectors, such as Alan Erenberg, 39, the cost is worth it. He says 
the furniture perfectly fits the hacienda-inspired architecture so prevalent in 
Southern California. A vice president of Serta, the mattress company, he and 
his former wife, Lori, replaced their collection of '50s furnishings with 
Monterey when they bought a 1920s California ranch house. When they recently 
divorced, he said he "got custody" of the furniture, which now decorates his 
Spanish Revival apartment in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean, however, that everybody loves Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Gloria List's clients at Nonesuch Gallery in Santa Monica "find it 
garish and klutzy," she said. And even converts can tire of Monterey's quirky 
style. Two of Shorts' best customers, he sadly reports, recently tossed out 
their Monterey collection in favor of crisp, contemporary furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
But Mason is glad that at least some see the world through his eyes. After 
returning from military service, he longed for the Monterey days. First he 
represented another furniture company; then he ran a store that sold Colonial 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an unhappy guy," he said.

STATE DROPS THREAT TO FINE WHITTIER ON WASTE MISHAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WHITTIER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state has dropped its threat to fine the city up to $30,000 in connection 
with a June mishap at a household toxic-waste roundup after city officials 
warned that they would refuse to hold more roundups. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services cited Whittier for failing to report to 
the state that a contractor hired to manage the roundup created a small toxic 
cloud by mixing several types of acids together. By law, the state should have 
been notified within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Marxen, a spokesman for the Department of Health Services, said the state 
decided against the fine because it might scare off other cities conducting 
toxic-waste roundups. In such roundups residents dispose of household chemicals 
such as paint thinners and insecticides. About 400 households participated in 
Whittier's roundup. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not after the money," Marxen said. "What we're after is having them 
comply with the law and understand that they have violated the law. . . . The 
public airing of their fault was felt to be enough of a punishment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City's Position 
</P>
<P>
Michael Woods, an attorney who handled the case for Whittier, said the city was 
"not simply going to roll over" and take the fine. The city's position has been 
that any fine as a result of the accident should be paid by the contractor, 
Omega Recovery Services, which was paid $60,000 for the job, Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also told the state that if Whittier were fined, the city would 
refuse to conduct any more toxic roundups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the city was going to end up getting slapped with a fine for its 
responsible effort (to hold the roundup), then why take that risk?" Woods 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
In an out-of-court settlement of the issue, city officials agreed to: 
</P>
<P>
Make presentations to other cities in the Los Angeles area about the correct 
way to run a household toxic-waste roundup; 
</P>
<P>
Provide extra training over the next eight months to city employees involved in 
handling hazardous wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Send the state within 60 days a detailed plan for any future hazardous-waste 
roundups. 
</P>
<P>
Request state approval at least 60 days before any future roundup. The state 
normally requires only 30-days' notice from agencies who want to organize such 
events. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going to Be Watching' 
</P>
<P>
"This is just as serious as when we were talking about the fine," Marxen, the 
health services spokesman, said of the agreement. "We're going to be watching 
(Whittier officials) pretty closely in the future because of their track 
record." 
</P>
<P>
During the roundup, Dennis O'Meara of Omega Recovery Services mixed several 
types of potent nitric acid in a 55-gallon drum. O'Meara, who was not wearing 
the proper protective clothing, was treated at a hospital after his face and 
arms were burned. 
</P>
<P>
After the citation was reported in news accounts, the city fired Tom Bayles, 
the assistant public services director responsible for hazardous waste 
disposal.

<P>
The USO has received a city permit to move its administrative offices and 
social club into the restored Masonic Temple on Pine Avenue in downtown Long 
Beach, close to the 16,000 military personnel who live in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the United Service Organizations of Los Angeles say the Pine 
Avenue club will open this spring. It will provide a lounge and game room for 
servicemen. In addition, it will offer a variety of services to military 
families, such as housing and child-care referrals. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, with its sizable military population, is now a much more suitable 
site for the club than Hollywood, USO officials said.

President Francois Mitterrand stressed France's role in a unified Europe by 
delivering a New Year's Eve speech from Strasbourg, headquarters of the 
European Parliament. It was the first time a French head of state had made the 
traditional address to the nation from outside Paris. Mitterrand urged France's 
11 European Community partners to make 1989 a year of growth, saying: "Only a 
Europe united in technological, economic and monetary terms can rival Japan and 
the United States. Only a politically united Europe can hold up its head before 
the powers that dominate the world."

Twenty-seven people in Plymouth, Mass., were arrested on trespassing charges as 
125 activists demonstrated against the restart of the Pilgrim nuclear power 
plant, shut down since April, 1986, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
branded it "one of the worst-run" nuclear plants in the country. Last week the 
plant started low-power testing, and it should be at full power in four months. 
The state has vowed to do everything possible to keep the plant from operating. 
Last month, Massachusetts voters rejected a referendum question that would have 
permanently closed Pilgrim and the Yankee plant in Rowe.

THE RAILEY CASE; 
</P>
<P>
THE BRUTAL ATTACK ON THE POPULAR PASTOR'S WIFE AND HIS SUICIDE ATTEMPT BECAME 
DALLAS' MOST HAUNTING AND SENSATIONAL MYSTERY IN A DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE COCHRAN, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DALLAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bewildered friends and followers would recall that he looked tired and 
depressed, still grief-stricken and mystified over the savage assault on his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than a week had passed since he found her comatose on the garage 
floor, choked senseless and left for dead. She had not regained consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the early evening hours of April 30, 1987, the intense, balding man 
excused himself and disappeared into a private hospital suite. 
</P>
<P>
He locked and chained the door, sat down with pen and paper and began composing 
a chilling letter. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a demon inside my soul," he wrote. "It has always been there. My 
demon tries to lead me down paths I do not want to follow. At times that demon 
has lured me into doing things I do not want to do. 
</P>
<P>
". . . My demon has finally gotten the upper hand." 
</P>
<P>
When security officers broke in the next morning, they found him sprawled 
across the bed. He was alive but unconscious and in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby were empty bottles of prescription drugs and his rambling letter, which 
began with instructions for his funeral and ended thusly: 
</P>
<P>
"I have finally made the decision to take care of myself. I have grown weak. 
God has remained strong. Therein lies your hope. I have none. 
</P>
<P>
"Walker L. Railey." 
</P>
<P>
The vicious attack on Walker Railey's wife and his ensuing suicide attempt 
devastated three families, split a church and outraged a city. 
</P>
<P>
For Peggy Railey was by no means an ordinary homemaker, and her husband was 
perhaps Dallas' most dynamic and socially conscious young minister. At 39, 
Walker Railey reigned as the senior pastor of the city's 6,000-member First 
United Methodist Church and loomed as a rising star in his mainstream 
Protestant denomination. 
</P>
<P>
The news of the suicide attempt swept through town, nowhere more devastatingly 
than at First Methodist, where Railey's flock was already reeling from the 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keep Him in Our Prayers' 
</P>
<P>
His chief assistant, the Rev. Gordon Casad, told the congregation the next 
Sunday, "We must remember our pastor and the troubling of his mind and spirit 
and keep him in our prayers." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Railey was now a suspect, Park Stearns, supervisor in the Dallas FBI 
office, replied: "This is a big no comment." 
</P>
<P>
Although police refused to reveal the contents of Railey's letter, they 
described it as an apparent suicide note. And they redoubled their efforts to 
review with the convalescing minister what happened the night his wife was 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
A fellow pastor, the Rev. David Shawyer of Plymouth Park Methodist Church, 
said, "I'm praying that it is not what it looks like. I'm praying that what the 
police are suggesting could never be true. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm praying this will all come out some other way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Twist in Mystery 
</P>
<P>
Railey's attempt on his own life was only the latest twist in what would be 
called Dallas' most haunting and sensational mystery in a decade. One 
unrestrained commentator called the attempted murder the city's most 
extraordinary crime since the assassination of President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Railey survived, but only barely so. Comatose, she could not identify her 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
Several anonymous, typewritten death threats preceded the attack, apparently 
provoked by Railey's strong sermons and public statements against racial 
prejudice and injustice. But friends said Peggy Railey did not frighten easily, 
and she had encouraged her husband not to soften his stand. 
</P>
<P>
The last letter was slipped under the door of a church office just prior to 
Easter Sunday services. It said: "EASTER IS WHEN CHRIST AROSE, BUT YOU ARE 
GOING DOWN." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wore Bulletproof Vest 
</P>
<P>
Under the stern scrutiny of security officers, Railey delivered his Easter 
sermon wearing a bulletproof vest beneath his robes. 
</P>
<P>
It would be his last appearance in the pulpit of First Methodist's historic old 
sanctuary. He hammered the congregation with a theme of death and resurrection 
that morning. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to die," he said, pointing his finger at parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to die," he repeated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to die." 
</P>
<P>
Police and church officials first theorized that the attempt on Peggy Railey's 
life was some kind of grotesque retaliation for her husband's outspokenness. 
</P>
<P>
With his wife in critical condition, Railey stationed himself outside her 
hospital room, interrupting his vigil only for a trip downtown to give 
investigators an account of his activities the night of April 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noticed Open Garage Door 
</P>
<P>
He said he'd spent the evening doing research at Southern Methodist University 
libraries. Returning home about 12:40 a.m., he said, he noticed that a door to 
the darkened two-car garage was partly open. 
</P>
<P>
Driving inside with his headlights on, he found his wife lying on the floor, 
writhing in convulsions. Her face was puffy and discolored and she was frothing 
at the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
He said the children, Ryan, 5, and Megan, 2, were inside the house and 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
After the interview, Capt. John Holt, 37, the tall, sandy-haired supervisor of 
crimes against persons, told reporters the questioning was routine. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any indicators that would point to him as a suspect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arranged for Hospital Suite 
</P>
<P>
Railey returned to the hospital to arrange for a suite near his wife. He spent 
the day greeting a parade of visitors who expressed shock, sorrow and support. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who came to share their grief that day was a striking frosted 
blonde who carried a single red rose and disappeared into Railey's hospital 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
With the investigation in full swing and the FBI trying to identify the source 
of the death threats, Railey continued his hospital vigil under heavy police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just numb. . . . He's overwhelmed by it," said Ralph Shannon, a longtime 
church member. 
</P>
<P>
If Railey was silent, his ministerial colleagues were not. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Joseph Ofseyer of Congregation Shearith Israel said that Railey had 
suffered for his message of justice and equality but that the religious 
community would not "be cowed into silence" and "permit such a person to stand 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Almost lost or overlooked in the outcry was an observation by Police Lt. Ron 
Waldrop that the abusive letters appeared to be the work of one individual and 
not the concerted effort of a white supremacist group. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no central theme," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, the FBI determined that the death threats had been written 
on an office typewriter at First Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
Walker Railey's rise to clerical prominence seemed almost preordained from his 
turbulent childhood days in Owensboro, Ky., a coal mining town on the south 
bank of the Ohio River. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest of three children, Railey grew up a nonsmoker and nondrinker who 
delivered his first sermon at age 17 and became something of a circuit preacher 
while a history major at Western Kentucky University. 
</P>
<P>
He attended Vanderbilt Divinity School for a year, then headed to Dallas and 
the Perkins Theological Seminary at Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
It was there, in 1970, that he met Margaret Nicolai, an equally talented, 
intelligent and religiously dedicated young musician whom everyone called 
Peggy. She had arrived at SMU from Wisconsin to pursue a master's degree in 
organ music. 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances say Peggy recognized early on that young Walker was a man with 
great ambition and potential but that she was not much taken with him 
romantically. His persistence won her over and the couple were married in 
August, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
After obtaining a doctor of ministry in 1973, Railey ministered to several 
rural churches in Oklahoma and then was appointed an associate pastor at First 
Methodist in Dallas. In 1980, after a stint as a senior minister at a suburban 
Dallas church, he returned to First Methodist as senior pastor at age 33. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eight Ministers Became Bishops 
</P>
<P>
The appointment was the most dramatic step in a meteoric rise. Although not 
even the largest Methodist church in Dallas, First Methodist had the reputation 
as the nation's mother church of Methodism, in no small part because eight of 
its ministers had gone on to become bishops. 
</P>
<P>
Under Railey's leadership, First Methodist grew and prospered, its membership 
approaching 6,000 and its annual budget doubling to $2 million. And although 
Railey himself was short, balding and physically unimposing, his radiant 
ministry served as a magnet for the young, energetic and socially conscious 
while not alienating older, more conservative parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke out boldly against those who practiced or condoned racial intolerance. 
He clashed with a City Council member over what he perceived to be a racist 
stance on illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
He challenged President Reagan to take a "more visible and articulate stand" 
for peace and he once said of fundamentalist Jerry Falwell, "I guarantee he 
doesn't speak for the Kingdom of God, let alone the people in it." 
</P>
<P>
When the threats came, the Raileys seemed to take them in stride. The FBI 
encouraged Peggy Railey and the children to leave town for a while. Although 
she went to her parents' home for four days, she did not seem overly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Yarrington, wife of First Methodist's minister of music and one of Peggy 
Railey's closest friends, said Peggy told her that she and Walker were taking 
precautions but that they refused to be intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the attack, the Yarringtons and Raileys pledged to care for one 
another's children in the event of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
That pledge would soon come due. 
</P>
<P>
As Railey and his wife lay near death in the same intensive care unit, police 
were anxious to talk again with First Methodist's senior pastor. After his 
first interview, police found unspecified "inconsistencies" in Railey's account 
of April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Friends in the church hired a tough, no-nonsense criminal defense attorney 
named Doug Mulder to advise Railey, and as the minister recovered, he wasn't 
talking to police. 
</P>
<P>
He did, however, speak with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you . . . I just don't know anything," he told a veteran 
religion reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he told the Associated Press: 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't attack my wife. I didn't plan to have someone attack my wife. I 
didn't orchestrate a plan to attack my wife. And if I had written the letters, 
I wouldn't have written them on a typewriter in the church. But I didn't write 
them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Don't Understand Why' 
</P>
<P>
He could not rationalize his suicide attempt, which he knew was construed by 
some as an admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why I did it, any more than I understand why I lived beyond 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Mulder arranged for a private polygraph test, which indicated that Railey did 
not try to kill his wife. Presumably because of those results, Mulder approved 
a police-administered examination the next day. That exercise was described as 
"inconclusive." 
</P>
<P>
"The results showed that he didn't have anything to do with the attack, nor did 
he conspire with anyone," Mulder said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Railey's followers took new heart, investigators were unimpressed and 
restated the ongoing request to interview him. 
</P>
<P>
Holt accused Mulder of misrepresenting the outcome of the police-administered 
examination. He suggested that some of Railey's responses were "untruthful," 
but refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
All but overlooked in the flap over the polygraphs was an unattributed police 
statement that Railey's account of his activities the night of April 21 was "in 
direct conflict with indisputable evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The key word was "indisputable." 
</P>
<P>
The frosted blonde with the sparkling eyes was no stranger to the congregation 
at First United Methodist Church. Lucy Papillon grew up in the magnificent 
sanctuary, the daughter of the Rev. Robert E. Goodrich Jr., a former senior 
pastor and later a Methodist bishop. 
</P>
<P>
A portrait of Goodrich, who died in 1985, hangs in the First Methodist foyer. 
</P>
<P>
"She had that knotted Goodrich chin, his thin, drawn smile, and the dark eyes 
that were his most distinctive feature -- eyes that seemed remote but also 
searching and intelligent," journalist Larry Wright, a childhood acquaintance, 
wrote in Texas Monthly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a strong face, like her father's, and if in some lights it appeared 
hard, in others you could detect a vulnerable and even wounded soul who had 
lived past the point where life surprised her." 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Lucy played the piano in Sunday school and was a cheerleader at 
an exclusive girls' school. She entered Southern Methodist University in 1959 
to pursue a degree in music education and, four years later, married a 
Methodist preacher. They were divorced in 1973 after she bore two sons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked Variety of Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Friends say she worked at a variety of jobs, including a stint as a part-time 
model. Somewhere along the way she became enamored with psychology. She married 
and divorced again and, in 1982, received a doctorate in psychology and moved 
to California to complete her training. She found various jobs in her new field 
there and reportedly began to visit the Esalen commune. 
</P>
<P>
And it was there that Lucy decided to take on her identity as "Papillon," 
French for butterfly. In 1986 she opened a private psychology practice in 
Dallas and legally changed her name to Lucy Papillon. 
</P>
<P>
On July 14, 1987, Dallas County's chief prosecutor sat down with police and the 
FBI and heard for the first time all the facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenged to 'Talk or Walk' 
</P>
<P>
His face flushed with anger, his thick mustache almost bristling, Norm Kinne, 
53, stormed from the meeting room into a cluster of reporters and challenged 
Walker Railey, as one headline proclaimed, to "talk or walk." 
</P>
<P>
Eyes flashing and his finger jabbing at the nearest of four television cameras, 
Kinne declared: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of this man fooling with the justice system and the life of his 
wife. . . . I'm going to tell you, Walker Railey, I'm tired of you messing with 
the Dallas Police Department, and you're going to come before the Dallas County 
grand jury and you're going to clear up these discrepancies, or you're going to 
leave the country!" 
</P>
<P>
Kinne could subpoena Railey to appear before grand jurors, but he had no way to 
compel him to answer questions if he invoked the constitutional protection 
against self-incrimination. Nor was it in the fiery prosecutor's domain to 
order a reticent Railey out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photographs Triggered Outburst 
</P>
<P>
But at that moment, nobody was foolhardy enough to argue the issue with Kinne. 
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, a vaguely contrite Kinne said it was the photographs of 
Peggy Railey after the attack that so outraged him and triggered the outburst. 
</P>
<P>
"I got irritated because we have a lady here who is a loving wife and mother 
and who is lying in a hospital more dead than alive," he said. "And we have an 
alleged pillar of the community who will not talk to us about this." 
</P>
<P>
Six days before Kinne's outburst, a Dallas Morning News story linked Lucy 
Papillon to the Railey case, calling her a potential "reluctant witness." 
</P>
<P>
The article said mobile telephone records revealed that Railey called Papillon 
twice the night of the attack. Railey had neglected to mention those calls in 
his lengthy interview with police the morning after April 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Calls Placed to Home 
</P>
<P>
Phone records also showed that Railey placed two calls to his own home between 
midnight and 12:30 a.m., the last one about 10 minutes before he reported 
finding his wife near death on the garage floor. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators refused to discuss the significance of the mobile phone records 
but it seemed safe to assume they somehow represented the "indisputable 
evidence" of inconsistencies in Railey's story. 
</P>
<P>
Later, on the eve of a grand jury meeting on the Railey case, the Morning News 
reported that Railey had visited Papillon the night his wife was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the jury room, Kinne was eager to confront Railey, although he was 
certain that the embattled minister would refuse to answer questions and invoke 
his Fifth Amendment rights. Railey took the Fifth -- 43 times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew Nothing About Attack 
</P>
<P>
"I have followed the advice of my lawyer consistently and will consistently do 
that," Railey remarked brusquely when he emerged from the closed-door session. 
</P>
<P>
Papillon spent an hour before the panel and, according to her attorney, Phil 
Burleson, answered every question. She knew nothing about the attack, Burleson 
said, and then cautioned reporters against drawing conclusions that his client 
was romantically linked with Railey. 
</P>
<P>
But it made no difference. Leaks poured out of the grand jury room that Lucy 
Papillon was Walker Railey's mistress. 
</P>
<P>
According to those present, Papillon told grand jurors she first met Railey on 
a religious television show and they became romantically involved in June, 
1986, about the same time she changed her name. She said she had accompanied 
Railey on several ministerial trips and had vacationed with him in California. 
</P>
<P>
Nor were their liaisons confined to this country. Papillon revealed that Railey 
stopped over for a prearranged rendezvous in London while returning from a 
World Methodist Council meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, in July, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In one particularly chilling disclosure, Lucy said they embraced and kissed in 
Walker's hospital suite while Peggy lay near death nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sensational revelations, the grand jury testimony raised almost as 
many questions as it answered. And the "indisputable evidence" remained cloaked 
in secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a lot of discrepancies, but we're not going to discuss them," 
said Police Lt. Waldrop. "There is no statue of limitations on attempted 
murder, and that's how long we'll be working on it." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the discrepancies and the indisputable evidence did unfold. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the attack, Railey made several calls from a cellular telephone 
installed in his car at church expense only hours earlier as a security measure 
because of anonymous threats. A phone company computer recorded the times. 
</P>
<P>
Railey called home at 5:55 p.m. to say he was leaving the office. At 5:58 p.m., 
he telephoned Papillon and talked for one minute. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving home shortly before 6:30 p.m., Railey said he found his wife working 
on a faulty garage door lock with a bar of soap. Investigators later found no 
trace of soap on the lock, which was working fine. 
</P>
<P>
Railey said he sat on the hood of his wife's Chrysler and talked with her for 
several minutes. He told her he intended to spend the evening on a research 
project at the SMU libraries. He did not change from his business suit and left 
the house a little after 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:38 p.m., Railey, who never wore a watch, called on the car phone for the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
He said he spent half an hour or so at SMU's Bridwell Library and was back in 
his car by 7:26 p.m., at which time he phoned the family baby-sitter and 
discussed plans for a trip to San Antonio the Raileys planned later in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:32 p.m., he phoned Papillon at her home near SMU. He drove directly to her 
house, where he spent the next 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Railey Went Back to Library 
</P>
<P>
Railey told a friend later he went there to get some relaxation tapes to help 
relieve stress. 
</P>
<P>
From 8 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Railey was back at Bridwell, where he asked a 
librarian what time the library closed. At 8:30, Railey, using a pay phone, 
called home on a private line. Peggy Railey told him she was putting the 
children to bed. She then called her parents long distance in Tyler and talked 
from 8:49 p.m. until 9:14 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:53 p.m., Raily bought gas at a Texaco station near campus. After drinking 
a wine cooler, he said, he returned to Fondren Library, SMU's main library. But 
no one saw him there until after 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:30 p.m., a jogger in the Raileys' neighborhood spotted a man in a business 
suit and street shoes running through a yard south of the Railey home. Between 
10:15 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., a neighbor heard rustling sounds in the alley behind 
the home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried to Leave Business Card 
</P>
<P>
Sometime after 11 p.m., a librarian saw Railey at Fondren. Upon leaving at 
midnight, he attempted to give his business card to a student at the checkout 
desk. On the back of the card was a message requesting help in finding research 
information. Railey also noted the time, 10:30 p.m., when in fact it was 
midnight, the student told police. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:03 a.m., Railey called home on the car phone, but this time he used the 
public line. According to friends, the family seldom answered the public line, 
which was connected to an answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Babe," he said. "I'm calling you from my mobile phone. Peg, it's about, 
oh, I don't know. I don't have a watch. It's somewhere between 10:30 and 10:45, 
somewhere along in there. I worked at Bridwell until they closed and now I'm 
going to Fondren." 
</P>
<P>
This could not have been true. He had in fact just left Fondren, according to 
other accounts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lock the Garage Door' 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be in about 1. If you want to, go ahead and lock the garage door and I'll 
park out front. It really doesn't matter to me at this point. My concern is 
that you're safe. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
This portion of the tape might explain why Peggy Railey would enter the garage 
that night. Even so, Railey would still have to explain why, if he really 
intended to speak with his wife, he had called on the public line and left a 
message. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three minutes later, Railey phoned the answering machine again, and on 
this occasion gave the correct time: 12:29. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Babe," he began. "It's 12:29 and I'm on the way home from SMU. . . . 
Everything really went well. I got a lot accomplished. I had to leave my card 
with the reference librarian because there was one deal that I couldn't quite 
work out. I'm not calling on the private line because I know you're already 
asleep, but in case you get up with the kids, I just wanted you to know that 
I'm on my way home. It's 12:30. I'll be home about 12:45. 
</P>
<P>
"Love you. Bye-bye." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Sign of a Struggle 
</P>
<P>
At just past 12:40, Railey drove into his driveway and found his wife. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of a struggle. There was no skin under her fingernails to 
indicate that she had either fought her assailant or scratched herself when 
grasping at whatever was pulled around her throat. 
</P>
<P>
Railey said he determined that the children were safe and notified police. 
</P>
<P>
"Dallas Emergency, Ms. . . ," the dispatcher answered. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Walker Railey," he interrupted. "Send the paramedics and police, 
please." 
</P>
<P>
An ambulance arrived, along with neighbors. Inside the house, both children 
were in the living room, Megan watching a silent television screen and Ryan 
staring blankly ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, Kinne told a reporter he thought it possible that Ryan witnessed 
the attack, but he said the youngster gave investigators inconsistent accounts 
of what might have happened that night. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Daddy did it," the boy told investigators once. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors transferred Peggy Railey, her body alive but her brain barely 
functioning, from a Dallas hospital to a nursing home in east Texas so she 
could be near her parents. 
</P>
<P>
Bill and Billie Jo Nicolai live in Tyler, but they had spent almost all day 
every day in Dallas, about 60 miles away, attending to Peggy's needs. Though a 
full-service hospital was no longer required, she remained in a vegetative 
state from which she might never awaken. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Dallas, no sign was posted, but the Raileys' home was quietly put on 
the market and sold. 
</P>
<P>
Walker Railey voluntarily surrendered his credentials as a minister in the 
United Methodist Church, and then surrendered control of his wife's legal 
affairs to her parents. He granted temporary custody of his children to the 
friends who had kept them since April 22, John and Diane Yarrington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Assumed Guardianship 
</P>
<P>
Billie Jo Nicolai requested that a court grant her guardianship of her 
daughter, and Railey waived his right to continue in that traditionally spousal 
role. 
</P>
<P>
And then, after the stunning developments and disclosures of mid-November, 
Railey vanished. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he has some job prospects," Yarrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few months, Railey and Dallas reporters played a game of 
hide-and-seek. 
</P>
<P>
In early December, Railey told religion reporter Helen Parmley of the Dallas 
Morning News in a telephone interview from California that he fled despair, not 
speculation. And he maintained that he was not abandoning his children. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, while I am relocating, looking for work, financially strapped, 
not knowing where I'm going to end up or what I'm going to be doing, everybody 
involved in this drama believes . . . the most stable, loving, Christian 
environment they can be in is where they are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But before anybody could get themselves too lathered up over Railey's plight, 
Dallas Times Herald columnist Laura Miller put a new slant on the case by 
telling a tale of the anger and indignation of Peggy Railey's family -- her 
father and her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Both believe Railey was behind the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The motive? "A divorced man doesn't get to be bishop," said the grandmother, 
Ella Renfro. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wright, a contributing editor at Texas Monthly magazine, grew up in the 
First United Methodist Church in Dallas. His childhood pastor was Robert 
Goodrich Jr., Lucy Papillon's father. 
</P>
<P>
He left the church once in disenchantment but had been drawn back by Railey's 
socially contemporary ministry. Then he had seen the devastation at First 
Methodist after the attack on Peggy, Walker's suicide attempt and the 
minister's affair with Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
So Wright was less a journalist than a confused and angry member of the 
congregation when he confronted Railey. 
</P>
<P>
Did Peggy know about his affair with Lucy? 
</P>
<P>
"We -- that never came up," Railey stammered. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't know? 
</P>
<P>
"I can only say it never emerged." 
</P>
<P>
Did she suspect? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no way of knowing, regarding that, that she suspected at all, about 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Changing the subject, Railey revealed he had slipped into the First Methodist 
sanctuary to attend funeral services for a family friend. Some of his former 
parishioners avoided him but most embraced him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Could Feel Pain' 
</P>
<P>
"They could feel my pain," Railey said, crying. He said he also felt love. 
</P>
<P>
Did you feel a sense of shame, Wright asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a great need to be forgiven, if that's what you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Wright decided that was as much of a concession as he was likely to get. But 
before departing, he said he could not construct an innocent man out of 
Railey's behavior. The journalist recounted Railey's misleading testimony to 
the police, his avoidance of the grand jury and his inexplicable actions on the 
night of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Think You Are Guilty' 
</P>
<P>
"I think you are a guilty person," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear what you're saying," Railey replied. 
</P>
<P>
Wright did not know what to think. Railey failed to absorb his blunt 
accusation, choosing instead to analyze it with detachment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware that nobody can sit down with all the facts that are supposedly 
known . . . and just make it all fit. That's a frustration that everyone has 
felt, including me," Railey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Confess," Wright urged him. "It will haunt you forever, it will drive you 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if that's a word of advice, a backhand comfort or what," Railey 
said. "I'm not guilty. I didn't do it. I don't feel tormented by the guilt of 
what I didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 2, Billie Jo Nicolai filed a legal bombshell in civil court, accusing 
Railey of "maliciously" attempting to kill his wife and orchestrating a "clumsy 
attempt" to cover his actions with a phony alibi. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit sought damages for "physical and mental pain, disfigurement, 
anguish and physical impairment" on behalf of Mrs. Nicolai's comatose daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over the cost of Peggy Railey's medical expenses was the overriding 
reason for the action, but the family's decision was also emotional, said 
Billie Jo Nicolai's attorney, Bill Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Are Bitter' 
</P>
<P>
"They are bitter," he said. "They are angry." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Nicolai, Peggy's younger brother, revealed that Railey had visited his wife 
no more than three times and that after a Christmas visit with his two 
children, Ryan had suffered severe emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
Kinne, Dallas' chief prosecutor, had sent an investigator to question Ryan 
about the night of April 21, and the youngster talked freely about almost 
everything. But whenever the investigator asked about the attack, Ryan would 
tune her out. He would turn his back and try to leave the room. 
</P>
<P>
Railey moved to California, to a Victorian flat not far from San Francisco Bay. 
The rent reportedly was $1,600, and both he and Papillon signed the lease. 
</P>
<P>
Initial attempts to serve Railey with legal notice of the Nicolai civil suit 
were unsuccessful. Eventually, he was spotted at a hotel, and papers were 
slapped under the windshield wiper of a car driven by Papillon, with Railey 
apparently slumped down inside. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely one year after the events of April, 1987, a state district judge 
ruled that Walker Railey "intentionally, knowingly, maliciously and brutally 
attempted to strangle his wife" and cover up his actions with a "false alibi." 
</P>
<P>
Judge John Whittington issued a preliminary civil judgment on April 22, 1988, 
holding Railey financially liable for the injuries to his wife. The extent of 
damages would be determined later by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, although significant, had no bearing on the criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Whittington's action came after Railey failed to respond to legal notices of 
the suit. The judge said Railey, by his technical default, had admitted all the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fled Bay Area 
</P>
<P>
Railey could no longer be found. Under siege from the media, he broke the lease 
on the San Francisco "love nest" he shared with Papillon on her visits from 
Dallas. It appeared he had fled the Bay Area altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"The court can issue a subpoena that compels him to come answer my questions," 
Arnold said. "But today, I have less of an idea where he is than at any time 
since this case started." 
</P>
<P>
In June, doctors reported a slight improvement in Peggy Railey's condition and 
she was returned to Dallas and placed in the Baylor Institute for 
Rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Parker, the institute's medical director, said she could turn her 
head and hear, but could not process what she heard. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can establish anything that seems to stimulate a response that could be 
interpreted as functional, then we would continue to try, through repetition, 
to improve on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condition Downgraded 
</P>
<P>
Parker said he didn't think his team of specialists would be able to determine 
whether Peggy Railey would ever communicate again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the odds are probably going to be against it, but time is the only 
thing that's going to tell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year in a vegetative state, doctors downgraded her condition 
to a "persistent vegetative state," meaning, as a neurosurgeon explained, that 
her chances for recovery were "nil." 
</P>
<P>
After two months in Dallas, she was quietly returned to the nursing home in 
Tyler where her parents resumed their tender, but apparently hopeless, daily 
care. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Kinne sat puffing his pipe in the district attorney's office and 
reflecting on the Railey case, his opinions no less candid than when he first 
viewed the terrible pictures of Peggy Railey's wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy's a liar," Kinne said. "He's trying to cover his tracks. He wasn't 
where he was at the time he says he was. Now the question is, if he wasn't 
there, where was he? 
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion that everybody's drawn is that he was home choking out his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't necessarily follow. There's no proof he was at the scene at 
the time she was strangled. There's no evidence that he strangled her or that 
he knew who strangled her or that he arranged or participated in any way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Concrete Evidence 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say Kinne didn't think about prosecuting Walker Railey. He 
visualized presenting all the evidence that showed Railey lied, that he 
contrived an alibi and that he told no one of visiting his girlfriend that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
But with a defense move for an instructed verdict of innocent, the judge might 
ask, "Where is the evidence that he choked his wife?" Kinne said. 
</P>
<P>
The trial would probably be over before it began. 
</P>
<P>
As 1988 drew to an end, Kinne had not surrendered hope that the case might 
someday be solved, but any possibility was a long shot. Peggy Railey might 
miraculously recover and identify her assailant, or even young Ryan Railey 
might have seen something and be able to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing Incriminating 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Papillon might eventually shed light on the case, but Kinne once pointed 
out that she had said nothing incriminating "since we don't have adultery laws 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
For Kinne, Walker Railey remained the ultimate enigma. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing you'd expect from a guy like him would be to give up his wife 
and kids and flit off to California. Just say to hell with it and take off. 
It's just not what you'd expect from a man of his stature. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives every indication of guilt, whether he is guilty or not." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Railey Didn't Show 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 5, Judge Whittington heard testimony in a one-day trial to determine if 
Walker Railey should pay damages to the Nicolai family. Railey didn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
The family was awarded $16 million -- half to cover Peggy's care, half to 
punish Railey. It was a ruling more of symbolism than substance, a hollow 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said he didn't know where Railey was, or how much money he had. He 
doubted that his wife's family would ever collect the $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
On videotape, the court watched therapists treating Peggy Railey, who has 
virtually no body control and a haunting, lifeless look in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, her sister-in-law, Linda Nicolai, told of an experience at the hospital

The Queen of England rewarded 907 people, from a beekeeper to a banker to 
ex-Trade and Industry Minister Leon Brittan, with titles or medals in her 
traditional New Year's honors list. Brittan, who resigned after leaking a 
secret document in 1986, was granted a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, as was 
sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. Also on the list, mostly compiled on the 
recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government, were newly 
dubbed knight Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman of N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons and 
a member of the well-known banking family's British branch, and British 
Beekeeping Society Vice Chairman William Hooper, named a Member of the Order of 
the British Empire. Actor Peter Cushing, known for horror films and for 
portraying Sherlock Holmes, was made an Officer of the Order. Among several 
athletes honored was six-time world darts champion Eric Bristow, who became a 
Member of the Order and the first in his field to be so recognized.

 -- Bandleader Cab Calloway, who had to cancel a New Year's Eve appearance in 
Chicago because of illness, relayed greetings to his fans through his wife, 
Nuffie. "I wish everyone a Happy New Year," she quoted the "prince of hi-de-ho" 
as saying after she visited him at White Plains (N.Y.) Hospital Center. 
Calloway has been listed in critical but stable condition since emergency 
surgery for unspecified abdominal troubles that caused him to collapse Dec. 21 
during a concert tour in Japan. Nuffie Calloway said her husband, 81, "thanks 
everyone for their calls, flowers, letters and expressions of love, and he 
expects to feel better any minute."

 -- As he packed up office memorabilia recently in Newark, N.J., retiring 
Democratic Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr. looked back on his 40 years in Congress. He 
recalled rushing past reporters after the Judiciary Committee he chaired voted 
articles of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon in 1974, saying he 
went into a cubbyhole office, telephoned his wife and wept. Rodino, 79, pointed 
proudly to photographs of himself with President John F. Kennedy and his 
brother Robert, President Lyndon B. Johnson and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
Democrat Donald M. Payne will succeed Rodino, becoming the state's first black 
congressman. DAVE JOHNSON

KEEPING PETRODOLLARS AT HOME; 
</P>
<P>
SAUDIS MAKING EFFORT TO BOOST REGIONAL TOURISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Saudis, fewer petrodollars in their pockets and worried about security and 
culture shock, have started looking for holidays at home and finding that there 
is more to the country than sand. 
</P>
<P>
In the oil price heyday of the 1970s, Saudi Muslims flocked to the kingdom's 
air terminals to escape the heat and monotony of the desert for the great 
tourist capitals -- Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles, the French and 
Spanish Rivieras, Istanbul and Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
But local tourism has been on the rise for the last five years, spearheaded by 
a government campaign to encourage Saudis to spend their vacation dollars at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"There are quite a lot of religiously conservative families who suffer when 
they go abroad," said Ibrahim al Sayed, director general of tourism development 
in the country's mountainous southwest Asir region. "They don't want their 
teen-agers to copy Westerners." 
</P>
<P>
He added that many Saudis are also acutely aware that language and cultural 
barriers make them attractive victims for con artists abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"I've traveled in Europe and I've faced some of the troubles," said Fahd al 
Sayejh, public relations manager at the Riyadh Intercontinental Hotel. "My 
family's now looking for a villa in Abha (in the cooler Asir region). There are 
many people who spend their summers there who used to go to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful. It reminds us of the old days when we used to go to Lebanon 
every summer. The mountains are the same," he added. "(But) in the oil boom 
years, businessmen thought nothing of driving to the airport and boarding any 
available international flight. Now people are more aware of spending their 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Tourism within Saudi Arabia may seem like a hard sell, given the country's 
reputation as a "desert kingdom," lacking much in the way of amusement. 
</P>
<P>
But beaches along the country's eastern border on the Persian Gulf draw big 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Jidda on the Red Sea attracts scuba-diving enthusiasts and Najran, close to 
Yemen, offers unusual architecture. For a change of scenery, many tourists try 
the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole southwest area is very popular," said Antoni Kuhnen, who runs the 
Al-Baha Motel in that region. Kuhnen estimates that the motel, opened in 1985, 
now books around 20,000 tourists a year. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Baha, Saudi Arabia's smallest province, is situated between Taif, where the 
government retreats into the mountains for the summer months, and Abha, capital 
of Asir province, which boasts 1,736 square miles of national park. 
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper noted that "visitors to the Abha region reached an 
unprecedented number, to the extent that the real estate offices in Abha cannot 
cope with the great demand for furnished and unfurnished flats." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 800,000 visitors were reported to have made it despite a 
relatively small airport. 
</P>
<P>
The recent popularity of in-country tourism is due largely to the government. 
Five years ago, the few tourists who came to this region had to either camp out 
or rely on the kindness of strangers for accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there are five hotels in the area, some of them bankrolled by the Finance 
Ministry. Private businessmen are also being encouraged to invest in tourism. 
</P>
<P>
An amusement park would make the area more attractive to Saudi families who 
generally have large numbers of children to entertain, he said. Land has 
already been allocated, but awaits an investor. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Baha does not lack scenic beauty. At nearly 10,000 feet above sea level, the 
air is cool, crisp, and a bit damp -- a welcome change from just about anyplace 
else in the kingdom during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains, rough, craggy, and dotted with scrubby green plants, rise 
dramatically out of the Tihama Valley and are populated by shepherds tending 
flocks of sheep and goats. Baboons lope down the mountainside, carrying scraps 
of food fed to them by motel staff and early rising guests. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the facilities are there, the tourists will come," said Kuhnen, who 
nonetheless believes the region suffers for lack of recreational diversions.

BRAZIL'S FISHERMEN -- JANGADEIROS -- CLING TO TRADITION AS THEY REAP SEA'S 
BOUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER ATWOOD, Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FORTALEZA, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just before sunset, the fishermen sail into Fortaleza Harbor on their rafts and 
dump the day's catch of mackerel, moray eels and red snappers on the sand. 
People gather around shouting their bids. 
</P>
<P>
Fisherman Raminundo Nonato Tavares comes away with 13,000 cruzados (about $13) 
-- not bad for a day's work, but nothing like the old times. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a boy, we'd fish for half the time we do now and catch twice as 
much," said Tavares, who is 40 but whose weather-beaten face looks years older. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to come to port with the boat weighing low in the water from all the 
fish," Tavares said during a recent visit. 
</P>
<P>
Tavares is one of thousands of men on Brazil's northeast coast who for years 
have been fishing on jangadas, or small wooden rafts, but who now see their 
livelihood disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
Overfishing by big commercial trawlers and a boom in the shrimp trade, which 
kills tons of fish, have been cutting into their catch and forcing many to seek 
steadier work on trawlers. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 jangadas now sail out of Fortaleza Harbor, where 20 years ago there 
were about double that number, said Wilson Goncalves, president of the local 
fishermen's union in this city of 1.3 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Work is risky on a jangada, not much bigger than a double bed and powered only 
by the wind, and the fishing season lasts only six months a year, as the sea is 
too stormy in winter. 
</P>
<P>
But jangadeiros, as the fishermen are known, cling to tradition. 
</P>
<P>
They refuse the usual equipment for commercial fishing like motors, nets and 
compasses, relying entirely on hook and line and a knowledge passed down from 
generations of how to find the fish. 
</P>
<P>
Most are illiterate and, since their early teens, have never changed their 
routine of sailing out to sea before dawn and returning before sunset. 
</P>
<P>
They bring most of their catch home to their families and sell the rest to tide 
them over during the winter months. 
</P>
<P>
"The jangadeiro does not understand or want technology. He's a subsistence 
fishermen who will rely on custom until the day he dies," said Goncalves. 
</P>
<P>
Custom has well-served Tavares and other jangadeiros for generations. 
</P>
<P>
He can tell by the color of the water which fish will be most plentiful in a 
certain area. Darker, deeper water suggests the presence of mackerel, grouper 
and -- if it's a lucky day -- shark. 
</P>
<P>
A green hue often means a coral reef lies below, and that means the moray eel, 
which will bring Tavares a high price because of its tasty meat and because 
trawlers using nets rarely snare them. 
</P>
<P>
Using the weather, ocean currents and even the phases of the moon as his 
guides, he says, he can almost always find the kind of fish he is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"My father taught me most of it, but some of it I had to learn myself. The sea 
is always changing," he said as he cast his line in a place that he thought 
would yield red snapper, a small, ruddy fish. Within half an hour, he had 
caught five. 
</P>
<P>
But the 20th Century is closing in on the jangadeiros, who bitterly resent the 
commercial trawlers they say are emptying their waters of fish. 
</P>
<P>
"So many fish in the ocean, and our share is so small after the fishing boats 
come through," said Francisco dos Reis, who often joins Tavares on his craft. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be able to fill that basket with fish. Now we're lucky if we can 
fill it halfway after a whole day at sea," Dos Reis said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the drop in their catch is the boom in Fortaleza's shrimp 
industry, which exports heavily to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
When shrimp fishermen haul in their nets, they also bring in thousands of fish 
that have gotten entangled and died. The fishermen throw them overboard 
because, unlike the shrimp, fish won't bring in coveted export dollars.

FORGOTTEN TRIBES OF LEBANON'S WADI KHALED THRIVE ON SMUGGLING OF GOODS TO SYRIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
WADI KHALED, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trapped in this northern Lebanese valley, a forgotten community living by 
tribal traditions thrives on smuggling goods across the river to Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the affluence this has brought, the Bedouins of Wadi Khaled feel as if 
they are prisoners in their own land, captive because of a historical mishap 
that left them with no citizenship rights. Their status has been "under study" 
since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 years ago, the tribes' fear of officials drove the people to hide 
in the woods. They missed Lebanon's only official census, conducted in 1932 
when the country was still under French mandate. No population count has been 
carried out since, so the status of the residents of Wadi Khaled is still 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Mustapha, clad in traditional Arab headdress and gray gallabia, or 
ankle-length shirt, said the tribesmen mistook census officials for envoys of 
the Ottoman Empire authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"They hid in the woods because they were afraid their children would be drafted 
into the Ottoman army. They were illiterate people and did not understand that 
we were not under Ottoman rule anymore," said Abu Mustapha. 
</P>
<P>
The Bedouins of Wadi Khaled hold residence permits, issued to all foreigners 
living in Lebanon, and a document which classifies them in a "citizenship under 
study" category. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Palestinians and other refugees in Lebanon who have a special travel 
document, these tribesmen have no passports and can travel almost nowhere. 
Syria is the only country that allows them inside its borders, just for brief 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
"We have become prisoners in our own land," said Sweid. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Wadi Khaled -- named after Khaled Ibn al-Walid, who drove out the 
Byzantine Christians -- are divided into tribes who trace their origin to what 
is now Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1960s, they raised sheep in the bare rugged hills nearby. Then they 
turned to trade. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the border between a socialist country (Syria) and a country that 
believes in free trade (Lebanon)," said Bashir Hammoud. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has strict import controls and the smuggled traffic across the Nahr 
el-Bared river into the country includes television sets, radios, videos, 
fruit, vegetables, canned food, coffee, sugar, building material, clothes and 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Wadi Khaled's marketplace, Al-Arida, is a favorite of Syrian families, with 
prices given in Syrian pounds that the merchants later change to dollars at the 
rate of 46 to a dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"We sell here what Syrians can only buy on the black market in their country. 
Everything they do not have they buy here," said Hammoud. 
</P>
<P>
The Ghannam tribe, the largest and most influential, boasts that its standard 
of living is higher than that of many people in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Most of its members live in spacious cement houses with almost no furniture. 
They traditionally prefer sitting on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Khaled Sweid, who holds a degree in mathematics, estimated that each family in 
the Ghannam tribe earned an average of about $200 per month compared to the 
national minimum wage of $30 per month. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of Wadi Khaled, all Sunni Muslims, have pleaded their case with 
all the governments that have ruled Lebanon since independence in 1943, but to 
no avail. 
</P>
<P>
Christian politicians, who hold key posts in the government, have resisted 
naturalizing 10,000 Muslims because it could upset the sectarian balance in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plight became the subject of bickering among politicians," said a Ghannam 
tribesman, one of a group squatting in a smoke-filled room and sharing a meal 
of lamb and rice. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution for us lies with the Lebanese government. But now which one do we 
turn to?"

AT $80 PER MUSHROOM, PRICE FOR MATSUTAKE IS HIGH EVEN FOR THE JAPANESE 
</P>

<P>
In the land of $7 apples and $6 boxes of granola, matsutake mushrooms are in a 
class of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese drop their usual tones of careful politeness and become positively 
rapturous in describing these unassuming brown fungi, their woodsy taste and 
piney smell. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of one of the world's most exclusive restaurants, Kicho, where meals 
can run $800 a person and only an introduction from a previous customer can win 
a reservation, recently wrote: "In autumn we can almost not do our business 
without matsutake." 
</P>
<P>
But for the uninitiated, it is the price tag of the matsutake, or pine-tree 
mushrooms, that is so breathtaking: a few inches high and, in fact, rather 
mushroom-like in appearance, a single well-shaped matsutake can cost as much as 
$80; even an average one will run $40 per stem. 
</P>
<P>
Matsutake are so pricey and so prized that matsutake fraud has now entered the 
Japanese lexicon. Recently it was discovered that some of these mushrooms were 
being sold with tiny lead slivers inserted in their stems to inflate their 
weight and thus their asking price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worth It to Japanese 
</P>
<P>
For the Japanese, who adore all manner of mushrooms and use about half a dozen 
different varieties in their everyday food, the price is clearly worth it. "I 
love them," a Japanese newspaper editor said recently, as he dropped the 
subject at hand -- stock market manipulation -- to wax eloquent about 
matsutake. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese folk saying sums up the emotionalism toward matsutake: "The mountain 
where you picked matsutake cannot be forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
With this saying in mind, a farming community troubled by a high rate of 
bachelorhood among its young men recently held a matsutake-picking party in an 
effort to entice women back to the farm. 
</P>
<P>
According to mushroom connoisseurs, matsutake are expensive because their 
season is short -- just a few weeks in late fall -- and because they can grow 
only in the wild. Japan's wilderness has been disappearing steadily in the face 
of relentless urbanization, and the red pine trees around which matsutake 
flourish have also been diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Domesticated Yet 
</P>
<P>
The finest scientists have failed so far to domesticate the matsutake on a mass 
scale, despite repeated efforts. Mie Ogoshi of Japan's Tsuji Cooking School 
said that matsutake were much more common and much cheaper 20 years ago and 
were used liberally in the kitchen. Now, however, they are rationed 
parsimoniously: paper-thin slices in a special broth, a few bits mixed in a 
rice dish or a few grilled with a touch of lime and soy sauce. One special soup 
features a little matsutake with a touch of real gold shavings. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for matsutake is so strong that the import-resistant Japanese have 
turned to South Korea and China, where matsutake also grow and cost much less. 
</P>
<P>
Mushroom aficionados insist that these imports do not taste as good as local 
ones; among other drawbacks, to satisfy customs inspectors the matsutake must 
be washed well, which attenuates their aroma, they say. Nonetheless, every 
fall, die-hard matsutake lovers figure that it is worth the price of a 
Tokyo-Seoul round-trip ticket (about $500) to fill a few boxes with fresh 
Korean matsutake and lovingly carry them home. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even in affluent Japan, there are many who find $80 per mushroom a bit 
rich for the blood. One Japanese woman who raved about the taste and autumnal 
smell of matsutake admitted, after calming down, that she had not bought one in 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like They Are Gold' 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the price tag on the matsutake, it is like they are gold," 
acknowledged Ogoshi, of the cooking school. And like many high-priced foods in 
Japan, including the beautiful cantaloupe grown here and sold, individually 
wrapped, for $80 or more, matsutake most often are given as presents. 
</P>
<P>
For those who love their matsutake but cannot afford them, one enterprising 
Japanese company recently developed "essence of matsutake," a small vial of 
which costs only $2.50. The liquid can be poured on top of the lowly shiitake 
or ma-shu-ru-mu (white American-style mushroom), allowing the diner to imagine 
it is the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
For the truly desperate, stores sell a few slices of matsutake for the 
comparatively reasonable price of $20. When sniffed very closely they do give 
off a piney odor. Cooked -- one minute in a hot broiler or over a fire, with 
drop of a little lime juice -- they taste, well, like a mushroom.

In northeastern Afghanistan, small numbers of returned refugees have been 
rebuilding their homes and replanting their terraced fields. 
</P>
<P>
But not all the fields returned to the plow in the last year have been planted 
with wheat and corn. Many -- perhaps one out of every two -- were turned over 
to the cultivation of marijuana and opium-producing poppies. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many Western narcotics control officials, diplomats, some members of 
the Afghan resistance, and Pakistani officials, are concerned that this region 
could develop into the world's leading producer of heroin -- the potent drug 
derived from opium. 
</P>
<P>
The primary source of opium for the West remains Southeast Asia's "Golden 
Triangle" -- Burma, Laos, and Thailand. But since the mid-1980s, international 
narcotics control sources say, the "Golden Crescent" of Southwest Asia has 
gained prominence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30% of Market 
</P>
<P>
Together, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran account for at least 30% of the 
United States heroin market, these sources estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan, according to narcotics officials, is the region's largest 
producer. Last year's opium crop is estimated at between 500 and 700 tons. The 
1988-89 poppy season, which normally begins with the first rains in December, 
is expected to increase output by 100 to 200 tons. The reasons for 
Afghanistan's increased production include: lack of government control in much 
of the countryside during the nine-year war against Soviet occupation; 
crackdowns on cultivation in Pakistan, which have made Afghanistan a safer 
production center; Tehran's apparent willingness to allow trafficking through 
Iran; and growing demand in neighboring Pakistan and the West. 
</P>
<P>
For many peasants, white-and-pink poppy flowers are the easiest and most 
lucrative cash crop. Harvesting the sticky, black sap can bring a small farmer 
up to $2,000 -- a fortune in this area. Dealers take the opium by horse and 
mule across the border into Pakistan's tribal border districts; there, scores 
of illicit laboratories process the opium into heroin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Control 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to be Adam Smith to realize we have a problem," says Carlo 
Boccia, a representative of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Paris. 
"When drugs become more readily available, they become more difficult to 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Western narcotics officials say they do not know how much of Iran's 
"tremendous" poppy production reaches the international market. Pakistan is 
believed to have produced 200 or more tons of opium last year. Most of the 
region's heroin is manufactured in Pakistani labs. (Ten pounds of opium produce 
about one pound of pure heroin, which can sell for tens of thousands to a few 
hundred thousand dollars in the West. Heroin sold in the West is diluted, about 
5% pure.) 
</P>
<P>
One of the most severe effects of this rapidly growing regional trade, Western 
aid officials and other sources say, is its corrupting and undermining 
influence on Pakistani and Afghan society. They cite: 
</P>
<P>
* A rise in the number of Pakistani addicts, most of whom "chase the drag-on" 
(smoke heroin), from an estimated 200,000 in the early 1980s to between 1 
million to 3 million today. 
</P>
<P>
* The spread of heroin abuse among Pakistan's 3 million Afghan refugees. 
</P>
<P>
* Corruption that involves senior Pakistan government officials, Army officers, 
politicians, refugee administrators, businessmen, tribal leaders, and members 
of the Afghan resistance. This was alleged separately by narcotics and 
intelligence officials, and Western aid sources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Warfare Feared 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are fears that the "drug and gun culture" on both sides of 
the border could increase gang warfare. "You have got to understand that it is 
a huge business in this part of the world. There are terrible things going on, 
and they involve a lot of people," says a worried representative of the Afghan 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's new prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, has described illegal drugs as 
the country's "No. 1 problem" and has created a Ministry of Narcotics to tackle 
it. Diplomats and aid workers are skeptical about chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason we have not yet seen the sort of violence you find in Colombia 
(South America) is that enough people here are getting paid off to keep the 
trade going," a Western aid official says. "The moment you start hitting where 
it hurts, the situation will start getting nasty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Route Through Karachi 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics from eastern and northern Afghanistan and Pakistan's border areas are 
channeled to Karachi; those from southern Afghanistan go toward Iran. 
</P>
<P>
According to aid sources, trucks from the government-run National Logistics 
Corporation, which normally carry goods to Afghan refugee camps, often take 
heroin to Karachi. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of direct collaboration with the police, the Army, and the 
refugee administration," says a Western official. 
</P>
<P>
For appearances, sources say, a vehicle is sometimes deliberately sacrificed to 
the police. The rest then proceed unhindered to Karachi, where the heroin is 
taken by boat or plane to the Mideast and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Berlin an Entry Point 
</P>
<P>
Some sources allege that officials in Pakistan's National Shipping Company are 
involved. Narcotics officials say East Berlin, a drugs gateway in the 1970s, is 
once again becoming a major entry point. 
</P>
<P>
The production of opium in southwest Afghanistan has come under the control of 
local drug lords, cooperating closely with Pakistani traffickers as well as 
drug syndicates from Europe and North America, intelligence sources say. 
</P>
<P>
At Musa Qala, a fertile region in southern Afghanistan, poppy growing is 
largely run by Nassim Akhun Zada, say journalists and relief workers who have 
visited the area. Zada is a guerrilla commander, reportedly still affiliated 
with an Afghan resistance party, the Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami, but who 
operates largely on his own. Western sources say Zada leads a private army of 
1,200 fighters. Recently, there have been reports of pitched battles with a 
rival, Abdul Rahman Khan of the Hizb-i-Islami resistance party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Role Seen 
</P>
<P>
From Musa Qala, part of the opium harvest is transported to eastern Iran. But 
most is taken to the Pakistani desert refugee camps at Gerde-Jangal. There, 
resistance and aid sources say, trafficking is carried out in collaboration 
with officers of Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence (ISI) organization. 
</P>
<P>
At Gerde-Jangal, the opium is weighed and some is processed by local labs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much dealing going on that the money is not counted but weighed," 
a Western aid representative says. Various sources, including a former 
trafficker from Quetta, say narcotics are driven in five-vehicle convoys -- two 
carrying drugs, the other three armed guards and heavy machine guns -- through 
government checkpoints, to Robat. 
</P>
<P>
Robat is believed to have 20 or more heroin labs, from which the drug is driven 
in armed convoys across southern Iran to Turkey and on to Europe and America. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say the Robat operations involve members of at least three Afghan 
resistance parties. It is uncertain whether party officials in Quetta and 
Peshawar are linked to the trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are forbidden to enter Robat "for security reasons." Some sources 
claim that the aim is to prevent outsiders from witnessing what goes on. 
</P>
<P>
"It is perfectly obvious that this trafficking could not proceed without the 
full knowledge of the ISI (Interservices Intelligence) and the local Pakistani 
authorities," a West European diplomat says.

A SAD BUT GROWING PHENOMENON;

CHINA COPES WITH ITS UNWANTED BABIES

<P>
Shen Xiaozhi, a 2-month-old foundling with a growth the size of a grapefruit on 
her back, is one of the lucky ones. She is being looked after in the 
well-equiped Beijing Children's Welfare Institute. But many of the thousands of 
unwanted babies being left in big cities in railway stations, outside 
hospitals, on docksides and even tossed on rubbish heaps cannot expect to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
It is a phenomenon that has grown steadily in recent years, partly as a result 
of the one-child policy but also because as social controls have loosened, 
China's rural population has become more mobile. 
</P>
<P>
The temptation for Chinese peasants to abandon their physically handicapped 
babies in big cities where there is at least a chance of getting the right 
medical care and treatment is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes, Money Attached 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the babies are found with money or notes attached to them but never 
with the parents' address," said Ye Tieliang, director of the Beijing Children 
Welfare Institute, the city's only state-run orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
According to the People's Daily, about 50 foundlings are left at Beijing's 
capacious and overcrowded railway station each year and similar numbers are 
left at other major stations. Between 1986 and 1987, nearly 700 foundlings were 
picked up in Canton city while an investigation in five of the province's 
counties showed that 862 babies were picked up. 
</P>
<P>
The babies are frequently female or suffering from Down's Syndrome, broken 
backs, deafness, blindness -- or even such easily cured defects as harelips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Many Never Survive' 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial sources claimed, however, that the problem is far greater than is 
being admitted with thousands of children being left in Beijing alone. "Most of 
them never survive. They are usually too weak and they are an unwanted burden," 
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the legal newspapers said that in 15 months, 25 vagrants had 
been found dead at Beijing's railway station. The issue is highly sensitive and 
public security officials, who are responsible for handling the unwanted 
babies, declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Ye denied a People's Daily report that his institute received 141 handicapped 
foundlings last year. However, the Beijing municipal authorities have issued a 
circular warning people they will face prosecution if they abandon a child, an 
act that contravenes the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rewards Offered 
</P>
<P>
Rewards are being offered to people who help locate parents of the foundlings. 
Only 1.8% of the country's 10 million disabled children receive special care in 
child welfare institutions set up in the country's urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are 60 state-run child-welfare institutions that can provide 
reasonable service on a long-term basis to 11,000 disabled children in urban 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Institute appears to serve primarily handicapped children in return 
for financial donations. At the Tianjin children's welfare institute, officials 
say that what was originally designed for orphans has become "an abandoned 
babies" collecting house. 
</P>
<P>
"The cruel-hearted parents threw out their babies who were handicapped but they 
had money to buy refrigerators and color TV sets, so why didn't they send these 
children to hospital?" an official at Tianjin was quoted by the People's Daily. 
Few of the orphans are adopted and the Tianjin children's institute says it can 
no longer afford to pay for so many children's medical fees.

PRIEST'S OUSTER SILENCES HAITI'S VOICE OF THE POOR 
</P>

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The expulsion of a radical slum priest from his ecclesiastic order has silenced 
Haiti's most influential voice for the rights of the nation's poor. 
</P>
<P>
In expelling Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the conservative Salesian Order 
accused the populist Roman Catholic cleric of fomenting class warfare, calling 
him a "protagonist of destabilization." 
</P>
<P>
His ouster was announced Dec. 15 in a statement from Rome. Although Aristide 
remains a priest, he cannot officiate at Mass or deliver sermons over church 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been neutralized," said sociologist Franklyn Midi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outspoken Campaigner 
</P>
<P>
Aristide, 35, a Salesian priest since 1975, has been one of the most outspoken 
campaigners for social justice in a country ruled for nearly its entire 
184-year existence by dictators. 
</P>
<P>
He has escaped at least three attempts on his life, including a Sept. 11 attack 
at his St. Jean Bosco Church in a Port-au-Prince slum in which thugs armed with 
machetes, guns, clubs and spears killed 12 people and wounded at least 70 
others. 
</P>
<P>
One week later, rank-and-file soldiers overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a 
coup that put Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in power. Coup leaders said they wanted 
democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsored violence, citing the church 
massacre as an example. 
</P>
<P>
Salesian officials expelled Aristide after he failed to obey their order to 
leave Haiti by Oct. 17 and assume a new post in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Protests 
</P>
<P>
Two previous transfer orders were rescinded because of popular protests. 
Thousands protested in support of Aristide for several days in October, but 
there were no immediate demonstrations after the expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Aristide, who has been seen in public only once since the church massacre, has 
made no public statement and has declined requests for interviews. But friends 
say his morale is excellent and he might appeal the church decision. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its condemnation of military brutality and human-rights abuses in 
Haiti, the Catholic hierarchy has long opposed Aristide's political 
proselytizing of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
A proponent of liberation theology, which advocates church involvement in a 
political struggle by the poor against social injustice, Aristide preaches 
"active nonviolence." He urges a "real revolution" to bring democracy to Haiti, 
but does not specifically propose an armed uprising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire and Brimstone 
</P>
<P>
His pulpit style is that of a fire-and-brimstone preacher whose leading 
questions prompt quick responses from the congregation. The sermons were 
broadcast nationwide and earned Aristide a huge following among the urban poor 
and the rural peasantry, who call the bespectacled ascetic their "prophet." 
</P>
<P>
Although civic leaders and many priests applauded Aristide's crusade, the 
church hierarchy apparently feared the possible consequences of radicalizing 
the masses. 
</P>
<P>
"The upper and middle classes, of course, have heaved a sigh of relief," Midi 
said of Aristide's ouster. "They are uncomfortable when the voice of the poor 
is raised too high." 
</P>
<P>
"What they have not understood is that Aristide has contained the resentment of 
the impoverished masses by giving it a religious form," Midi added. "He has not 
sent them into the streets but drawn them into the church." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bishops Were Worried 
</P>
<P>
A Salesian spokesman in Rome, Father Joseph Aubrey, told the Voice of America 
that the expulsion was ordered because Haitian "bishops worried about the 
results of Aristide's action." 
</P>
<P>
But Father Serge Miot, secretary of Haitian Bishops Council, denied that the 
council had asked the Salesians to expel Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
The effective silencing of Aristide coincides with a move by Avril to tighten 
army discipline after a purported Oct. 14 coup attempt. Since then, the 
government has imprisoned or discharged dozens of soldiers for alleged 
insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
Leftist politicians have accused the government of clamping down on the most 
progressive element in the army -- soldiers angered by the slow progress in 
bringing about the democratic reforms Avril promised when he became president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Become a Symbol 
</P>
<P>
It is not known what role, if any, the government had in Aristide's ouster; but 
to some, the priest has become a symbol of the democratic struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"Aristide was discharged from his religious order in the same way that soldiers 
faithful to the Sept. 17 reform movement have been discharged from the army," 
said Paul Dejean, a Haitian author and social worker, referring to those who 
participated in the coup to gain democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"People who believe in the Gospel values of liberation, liberty and justice are 
penalized and punished," he said.

'DOUBLE STANDARD' RAISES EYEBROWS IN SHIAS' CAPITAL

BAALBEK, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scantily dressed dancers are long gone. The last liquor store was blown up 
six years ago. This ancient Roman city now is the Lebanese capital of Shia 
Muslim fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
Public drinking and dancing are forbidden now, but brief male-female unions 
called "pleasure marriages" are condoned. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface at least, life in Baalbek is governed by the dictates of 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's stern brand of Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, 
which to Western eyes appears joyless and forbidding. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing makeup or jewelry in public is taboo. So is singing and dancing at 
mixed gatherings because, as one woman noted, "it causes psychological 
imbalance and tempts men." 
</P>
<P>
But when the sun goes down and the doors are locked, the black robe-like 
chadors Shia women have to wear in public are discarded in favor of shorts and 
strapless tops, along with makeup and perfume. 
</P>
<P>
"People think we're made of stone just because we cover ourselves with chadors. 
But we're not. We're ready to do anything to please our husbands," said Selma, 
a housewife. 
</P>
<P>
Before Lebanon's civil war erupted in 1975, Baalbek was a cultural center where 
dance and theatrical festivals were held in the breathtaking Roman 
amphitheaters. 
</P>
<P>
Now the ruins echo with Islamic slogans as the fundamentalists stage political 
rallies there, chanting ritual denunciations of "Death to America! Death to 
Israel!" The amphitheaters have also been used as mortar positions in Lebanon's 
sectarian fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The Shias' strict life style has drawn bitter criticism from many Lebanese, 
Muslims and Christians alike who say that the fundamentalists' "double 
standards" have brought Islam into disrepute. 
</P>
<P>
Most Shias in Baalbek belong to Hezbollah (Party of God), which is believed to 
be an umbrella for Shia kidnapers holding most of the 16 foreigners missing in 
Lebanon. It's made up of zealots blindly loyal to Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
"We follow whatever Khomeini decrees. Whatever he rejects, we reject," said 
Zeinab Nasser, an administrator at the women's "haouzeh," or religious center, 
in Baalbek. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs frowned on by 
other Lebanese, especially moderate Shias and Sunnis. 
</P>
<P>
In a pleasure marriage, a young woman who would not dare expose a curl of her 
hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited number of lovers in the 
name of religion. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are considered 
respectable and far from promiscuous. 
</P>
<P>
The practice is widespread in Iran, where the overwhelming majority of the 54 
million population is Shia. 
</P>
<P>
Nasser said the Prophet Mohammed sanctioned pleasure marriage, making it 
acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period that could last "for an 
hour, two days, a month or as long as they desire." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child born after the 
marriage contract expires," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
She said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid Lebanon's economic 
crisis because "men cannot afford a regular marriage, and let's face it, they 
have physical needs. 
</P>
<P>
"If these cannot be met within a permanent marriage, pleasure marriage provides 
the outlet," she added. "It's much better than doing it illicitly." 
</P>
<P>
No cleric is required to perform the ceremony. The woman, who should preferably 
be either divorced or widowed, tells the man, "I give myself to you in 
pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
He responds: "I accept." And that's it. 
</P>
<P>
Virgins need the consent of their parents, but they often do not seek it. 
</P>
<P>
As for forms of entertainment, the fundamentalists permit classical music 
"because it does not have any negative psychological effects," Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
She observed that a scientific report proved that loud music is bad for "the 
nerves and the blood circulation." 
</P>
<P>
Like other factions in Lebanon, where the government has collapsed, the Shias 
have established their own medical and welfare systems, amply funded by Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas Mousavi, a Hezbollah leader, said: "Social work has become one of our 
main responsibilities because of the catastrophes that have befallen Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"We've founded the Imam Khomeini Hospital here, which provides free medical 
treatment. There are similar centers in other Shia areas." 
</P>
<P>
He noted: "We've also founded pharmacies that make a very small profit, as well 
as schools, which we hope will accommodate 6,000 students in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"We've given money to needy families and bought deep-bore drills to provide 
wells in remote villages, especially those we consider to have military or 
political importance." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and nightclubs, Mousavi 
noted: "We're not imposing Islamic values on people. No one can say we've 
raided houses where people gamble or drink." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs, he conceded: "There were 
incidents where young men acted out of Islamic zeal after witnessing aberrant 
behavior. But Hezbollah is against that."

<TEXT>
<P>
About 150 miles from Bogota lie the mines of Muzo and Coscuez, the biggest 
emerald deposits in the world. The car drive from the Colombian capital over a 
potholed track takes eight to 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
To Santa Barbara, a small town 5 miles from the mining centers, the land is a 
lush green. Thereafter, the terrain is a gray bleakness. The wild mountain 
peaks are covered from morning until evening in a cloak of mist as if nature 
seeks to hide its treasures. 
</P>
<P>
The houses in Santa Barbara are made of wood, despite the millions of pesos to 
be made in the town every day. There are no hotels, not even hostels for the 
simple traveler. Yet the finest and most expensive Scotch flows, and fortunes 
are squandered in the town's bars and dives. 
</P>
<P>
The neighboring town of Muzo usually has about 5,000 residents, but during an 
emerald boom -- and that happens whenever a new seam is discovered -- the 
population soars to 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warnings Issued 
</P>
<P>
For those unacquainted with the land, the journey into the mining zone can be 
extremely dangerous. Tourists are warned to stay away. The area has been dubbed 
the "Land of 1,001 Nights" and the "Devil's Caldron." 
</P>
<P>
Wild rags-to-riches stories go the rounds in Muzo and Coscuez, where 
millionaires have been made overnight. Thousands of adventurers have lost their 
lives in bloody fighting among themselves. Numerous crosses planted by the 
roadside or dotting the fields are silent testimony to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
The emerald is a form of beryl, a mineral found principally in granite and 
granite pegmatites. It is prospected in its pure form as a precious stone and 
is green or blue-green in color. 
</P>
<P>
"The most valuable are the so-called 'oil drops' and 'water eyes,' veritable 
masterpieces of nature for which vast sums are paid," explained a jeweler in 
Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
The precious stones prospected in Muzo and Coscuez are sent to Bogota to be 
valued by experts. Shine, purity and color determine the price. 
</P>
<P>
Emerald mines can also be found in Brazil, Africa, Australia, India and the 
Soviet Union. Japan even produces synthetic emeralds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Owns Resources 
</P>
<P>
The deposits in Colombia were mined in pre-Columbian times. The present 
official prospector, the Compania Esmeraldas de Colombia, holds the concession 
from the state, which owns all mineral resources in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The question of how much emerald is actually found in Colombia each year is 
difficult to answer, as great quantities of the precious stone disappear onto 
the black market. 
</P>
<P>
Official figures put the annual legal export of emeralds at $36.3 million. 
However, insiders reckon that between $100 million and $150 million worth of 
Colombian emeralds are marketed each year. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the stone depends on many factors, including ever-changing supply 
and demand, and the fluctuating rate of the dollar. Prospective purchasers are 
advised not to buy from strangers in the street, but to go to a respected 
jeweler. 
</P>
<P>
Distinguishing a fake from the real thing is not an easy task, even for the 
experts. Many a traveler has returned home with worthless glass instead of a 
valuable gem.

Margaret Swett Plummer, one of the oldest rangers in the National Park Service, 
has died of a heart attack. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
Plummer worked at the John Muir Historical Site in Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
She was regarded by authors and scholars as an invaluable source on naturalist 
John Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, and her grandfather, John Swett, a 
pioneering California educator. 
</P>
<P>
As a young girl, she would listen to her grandfather and Muir having passionate 
but amicable discussions.

WOMAN DIES TRYING TO GET INTO HOME VIA WINDOW 
</P>

DAYTON, Ohio

<TEXT>
<P>
A neighbor saw what he thought was a department store mannequin hanging upside 
down from the window of the house next door and ignored it. It turned out to be 
a woman who died of exposure while trying to break into her home. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Sherry Gaydos, 34, clad only in her underwear and socks, was found 
Wednesday by the neighbor, hanging upside down with her left leg wedged in a 
pantry window at her home. 
</P>
<P>
Gaydos' husband, John, was asleep inside the house when the incident occurred, 
unaware of his wife's struggle for life, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It took two policemen to pry the window off her foot," John Gaydos said. "She 
hung upside down by her ankle and froze to death." 
</P>
<P>
Gaydos said his wife left home while he slept Tuesday evening and drove the car 
to the end of the alley, where the vehicle struck a telephone pole. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Gaydos was taken unconscious to a Dayton hospital for treatment, then 
was released or left on her own, her husband said. In the meantime, her car -- 
with the keys inside -- was towed out of the alley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police told Gaydos that their investigation showed that his wife took a cab 
from the hospital to their home around 1 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With her keys gone, Sherry Gaydos apparently tried to force her way into a 
pantry window at the rear of the building and became trapped after the window 
closed on her foot, her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaydos said his wife apparently had removed some of her clothes "because she 
was trying to be thin enough to get through the small window." 
</P>
<P>
"It was very small. No human could really have gotten into it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared Sherry Gaydos tried to boost herself through the window using a 
metal garbage can. The can was tipped over beneath the window. 
</P>
<P>
Wilma Johnson, the neighbor who discovered the woman's snow-covered body, said 
she noticed the body hanging from the window about 9 a.m. Wednesday but thought 
it was a department store mannequin. When it still was there several hours 
later, she investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Gaydos said he was at home while his wife was trying to enter the house, having 
fallen asleep on the couch. He said he awoke at about 11:30 and went to bed but 
was not aware that his wife had left. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Lett, an investigator with the Montgomery County coroner's office, said 
the official cause of death was not determined pending toxicology tests. 
</P>
<P>
"With this type of death, a woman hanging out of the window by one leg in her 
underclothing in severe weather, you question that kind of death," Lett said. 
"But at this point we did not find any foul play."

ERITREAN REBEL CAMPAIGN BACKED BY HIDDEN FACTORIES, ETHIOPIAN POWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP WILLIAMS, United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AROTA, Ethiopia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 11 p.m. White-coated technicians shuffle in surgical clogs from tubes to 
beakers, inspecting the quality of anti-tuberculosis pills rattling out of a 
molding machine at a rate of 40,000 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the late shift. It is the only shift at "EPLF Pharmaceuticals," a 
lab housed inside four giant shipping crates 300 miles from the nearest 
independent electricity supply. 
</P>
<P>
Outside in a remote valley in Eritrea in northern Ethiopia, crickets and frogs 
join buzzing mosquitoes and the noise of foxes chasing African hares over the 
boulders. Civet cats and gray owls watch from stunted, moonlit trees. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, technicians of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front produce no less 
than 37 varieties of pills, capsules, ointments and liquids to be packed into 
brown bottles marked "EPLF Drug Production and Research" over a logo of a cobra 
wrapped round a pharmacist's pestle. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old drug venture is just one of many backup industries supporting 
the EPLF's 27-year-old guerrilla war for independence from Ethiopia. They 
produce souped-up automobile engines, machine tools, truck bodies, molded 
shoes, textbooks, pamphlets, flour-milling machines, macaroni, spaghetti and 
even sanitary towels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety of Darkness 
</P>
<P>
Like the watch and electrical repair shops and the tank and truck garages, they 
are heavily camouflaged and operate under the safety of darkness, free of the 
threat of bombardment from Ethiopian MIG warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
All are staffed by trained personnel, many graduates, working without salary as 
their contribution to the massive, centralized war effort. 
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical factory is the centerpiece of the key EPLF doctrine of 
self-reliance and self-sufficiency, forced on it by years of isolation from 
external support. 
</P>
<P>
Basic chemicals are imported from Europe to make a range of the most frequently 
used preparations against diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. The EPLF 
factories produce about 40% of the basic list of 187 EPLF-approved drugs 
covering tetracycline antibiotics, sulfanilamides, vitamins, iron supplements, 
anti-parasitic, paracetamol and aspirin compounds. 
</P>
<P>
Even limited current production is reckoned to be worth more than $750,000 a 
year -- $310,000 in sterile solutions for drips and major surgery alone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Shipping Containers 
</P>
<P>
Plans are afoot to boost capacity -- with the aid of more shipping containers 
and plentiful mud -- to 80% of total drug needs. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory and its integrated research department, run by an Eritrean 
pharmacist trained in Ethiopia and the United States, is hidden conveniently 
close to the EPLF's main hospital at Arota in northern Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital is a huge complex, able to treat 800 to 1,000 patients in small 
units dug into rock, camouflaged and spaced for safety along 5 miles of narrow 
valley. It links a network of provincial hospitals, civilian clinics and medic 
stations concealed near the battle fronts. 
</P>
<P>
About 99% of EPLF, civilian and Ethiopian prisoner casualties can be treated 
for almost every kind of ailment and wound in this health system. 
</P>
<P>
Neighboring valleys hold mechanical and electrical shops equipped with lathes 
and specialist machinery to service and substitute even the heaviest industrial 
plant for both civilian and military needs. That includes giant generating 
units to supply basic power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Italian Moulding Machine 
</P>
<P>
Footwear was a headache until Eritreans working abroad donated an Italian PVC 
injection molding machine eight years ago. It now cranks out 100 hot pairs of 
black plastic sandals an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic base granules are imported but -- saving a penny as ever -- 20% of 
the plastic input is recycled from machine waste and old sandals collected from 
fighters in the field. Black was not a color chosen on considerations of 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"White wouldn't do for camouflage reasons," said a sandal worker. "Black is the 
most convenient in that respect." 
</P>
<P>
Italian colonists who founded an Eritrean state in the late 19th Century left 
little transport infrastructure. Most major Eritrean towns are connected by 
poor dirt roads, but these are largely off limits to Eritrean supply convoys 
because of possible land mines and the threat from Ethiopian warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Movements of huge amounts of munitions and tons of gasoline required 
alternative networks. In physical terms, this was probably the greatest 
challenge and is the greatest concrete achievement of the Eritrean liberation 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hostile, Rocky Landscapes 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of miles of tracks capable of taking large trailer trucks have been 
driven through hostile, rocky landscapes. Most are hidden in dry, winding river 
beds, but shortcuts have been driven over 6,000-foot mountains with hairpin 
turns that would dizzy a Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days we cut those passes with sweat, shovels and picks," said a 
veteran fighter. "These days, it's a bit different." 
</P>
<P>
The rebels now have bulldozers, grading machines and blasting powder, 
supplemented by the combined muscle of some 12,000 Ethiopian prisoners of war. 
Like the stiff-lipped Britons of the "Bridge over the River Kwai" movie, they 
appear to take a perverse pride in their contribution to the Eritrean revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Garages dot the supply routes. They have vulcanizing units, welding and brazing 
tackle, compressors and machine lathes capable of turning out replacement 
pistons and rings with critical tolerances. 
</P>
<P>
Some specialize like Western car dealers in particular models such as Toyota 
Landcruisers, olive green four-wheel-drive Moskovitches or monolithic Soviet 
trucks designed to haul outsize field guns on tires 2 feet thick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chipped Coke Bottles 
</P>
<P>
The parsimonious efficiency of the EPLF backup operation, in which precious 
little is thrown away, defies cataloguing. Scraps of waste bread piled on 
sheets outside every field kitchen are not for the birds -- dried, they form 
the must and yeast for fermentation of a heady wheat beer served in chipped 
Coke bottles. 
</P>
<P>
In the ruined central Eritrean town of Nacfa, flattened by 10 years of almost 
daily bombing and now a gaunt symbol of the resistance, a 133-millimeter shell 
case hung on a string with a stick on a tumbledown wall is a makeshift alarm 
bell. 
</P>
<P>
Like swords turned into plowshares, finned back sections of huge unexploded 
bombs form mountings for drills and metal cutters. Rocket casings become 
charcoal grills and cooking knives. Door jambs, window frames, bunker roofing 
and furniture invariably are fashioned from wooden ammunition boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Donated burlap grain sacks are transformed into curtains and rugs, sun awnings, 
roof insulation and false ceilings. USAID sacks are particularly popular. They 
are often made from a close-woven, almost waterproof plastic and make warm 
mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
At the swarming Ethiopian POW camps, bored but grateful inmates fritter away 
hot hours around noon with playing cards cut from pasteboard ammunition 
packing. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun cools they stir and, helped enthusiastically by rebel guards as sick 
as their charges with a monotonous dry diet devoid of anything fresh or green, 
they tend cabbage, capsicum, courgette and spinach developed on EPLF 
agricultural research stations. 
</P>
<P>
The golden revolutionary rule is that nothing comes on a plate. The Eritreans 
have no alternative to self-reliance.

FROM CUCUMBERS TO CAVIAR; 
</P>
<P>
DEPARTMENT STORE EATERIES HAVE GONE TRENDY TO ATTRACT BUSY SHOPPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When caterer David Zafferelli joined the throngs at Nordstrom's new downtown 
San Francisco store in October, he dropped $150 on two flannel shirts and 
another $150 for bubbly and Beluga caviar at the store's Champagne Exchange 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
"We just thought that was as much fun as shopping," he said. "I'll always go 
for any excuse to drink champagne and eat caviar." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, shoppers who stop to nosh at department stores are finding chic, 
newfangled eateries in place of the proper tearooms and restaurants of their 
childhoods. Whereas patrons in the early part of the century sipped tea and 
nibbled cucumber sandwiches, customers of upscale department stores today are 
more likely to have espresso and cookies or Cornish game hen and Chardonnay or 
mesquite-grilled chicken and pasta salad. 
</P>
<P>
The shifts in department store food service reflect a fundamental change in the 
philosophy of shoppers, observers say. In the old days, people would make 
shopping an all-day event, with a leisurely lunch or tea break built in. Today, 
with time-starved but hard-working baby boomers hankering for service and 
quality, the right restaurant can serve not only as a lure but also as an 
incentive to linger in the store. And shoppers such as Zafferelli have proved 
willing to spend liberally for the ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, old-fashioned tearooms still exist, and some, such as those at 
Bullocks Wilshire and Bullock's Pasadena, are thriving, particularly at holiday 
time. But many stores in recent years have turned these genteel anachronisms 
into stylish cafes or bistros where customers come year-round just to dine, 
never mind the shopping. 
</P>
<P>
"The '80s has brought us into a whole different era," said Robert J. Nyman, 
president of George Lang Corp., a New York firm that develops restaurant 
concepts. "Most stores today are using food service as an amenity that has to 
do with the total marketing of the store." 
</P>
<P>
With department stores undergoing sweeping changes of late, many retailers, 
particularly downtown merchants that must compete with ubiquitous suburban 
malls, have strived to hold onto or devise unique operations that make them a 
destination. Restaurants often fill the bill, even if they don't contribute 
heartily to the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
At the new Nordstrom in San Francisco, for example, the marble-topped champagne 
bar has become a draw for upscale customers, as has an authentic English pub 
modeled on one at Harrods in London. At the flagship Bloomingdale's in 
Manhattan, the premier dining spot among half a dozen eateries is Le Train 
Bleu, a re-creation of a luxury Orient Express-type dining car. The Dayton 
Hudson department stores in the Midwest are expanding a Marketplace Foods 
concept that offers carry-out pasta, stir-fried dishes, freshly baked breads 
and frozen yogurt to busy downtown workers. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their tearoom predecessors, which usually were situated in a store's 
highest reaches, these food outlets are often stashed next to fashion 
departments. And they are a far cry from the Formica-topped counters prevalent 
at five-and-dime and discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities for food in department stores are the best they've been in 
over 20 years," said John D. Lovelace, central director of food services for 
Dayton Hudson in Minneapolis. "People eat every day, but they don't shop every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Food service has gone in and out of favor with retailers over the last few 
decades, and even today retailers' philosophies differ widely. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very mixed bag," said Charles J. Leven, senior vice president, 
director of operations at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. "Some companies are 
cutting back, a few are expanding." Saks intends to open its first restaurant 
at the flagship Manhattan store next year, Leven said, after customers clamored 
for food service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quick Food' Concepts 
</P>
<P>
Until about 1950, large department stores catering to the carriage trade 
typically used a chunk of their space for tearooms. In the 1960s, the 
popularity of such rooms declined, and many started losing money. As real 
estate became more valuable in the 1970s, merchants began devoting the space to 
clothing and other items that were more profitable. At the same time, many 
stores were going into suburban malls that had abundant sit-down restaurants or 
fast-food outlets in so-called food courts. 
</P>
<P>
Then women went to work in record numbers and the population became more health 
and diet conscious. Fewer people had the time or inclination to spend a 
leisurely afternoon at their favorite tearoom. That gave rise to a variety of 
"quick food" concepts in stores catering to customers for whom money was less 
of an object than convenience and quality. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom plunged into the food business 10 years ago after having leased space 
for years to a small chain of restaurants. It now has 70 food outlets in 58 
stores, most under the names Espresso Bar and Cafe Express, featuring fresh 
soups and salads. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with having to attract shoppers to a seedy location three blocks from 
Union Square in San Francisco, Nordstrom decided to go in for some culinary 
theatrics in its newest store. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to create little pockets of fun," said Jim Dickinson, general 
manager of the Seattle-based chain's restaurant division. "We also wanted to 
create a reason for people to stay in our stores rather than get out to our 
competitors." 
</P>
<P>
The Pub, strategically placed next to the men's department, is modeled on the 
Green Man at Harrods in London, an innovative retailer that houses about 20 
food outlets and a massive food hall where Londoners and tourists alike buy 
pricey groceries. The Nordstrom room features stools covered with forest green 
leather, a plank floor made of Kentucky barn wood, a healthy selection of 
imported and domestic beers and television monitors. 
</P>
<P>
If the Pub idea proves successful, Dickinson said, Nordstrom plans to expand it 
into other new stores nationwide. The chain also is considering a "bread basket 
concept" that would sell freshly baked goods and small open-face sandwiches, 
already dubbed Nordwiches. 
</P>
<P>
The store's Champagne Exchange was designed to offer a high return. It takes up 
less space by far than would a traditional tearoom yet affords a high markup on 
its caviar and 103 champagne varieties. The concept "enables the customer to 
spend a lot of money," Dickinson said. "We do find, particularly in San 
Francisco, it doesn't bother people to be drinking a $9 glass of champagne." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Flash 
</P>
<P>
The chain also this holiday rolled out its Nordstrom Select Pantry, a selection 
of gift food items developed in its restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Dickinson said, Nordstrom's restaurant operations account for 1.5% of 
the chain's annual sales (which last year totaled nearly $2 billion) yet 22% of 
its transactions, indicating that food tabs are generally far lower than those 
for other purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomingdale's flagship store in New York also goes in for selling sizzle along 
with its steaks. "The restaurants at Bloomingdale's have evolved into unique 
concepts in tune with the eating public," said Will Hellemeyer, director of 
food service. "We are what people expect of restaurants in the '80s . . . and 
not what they expect to find in a department store restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
After renovating the housewares department several years ago, the store was 
left with a long, narrow space on an intermediate level between two floors. A 
store designer came up with the idea of copying a luxury dining car, complete 
with green velvet chairs, white linen tablecloths and brass chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
Le Train Bleu (named for a midnight blue engine), which opened in 1978, is "a 
Continental restaurant that competes with restaurants on the East Side of 
Manhattan and is rated in dining guides," Hellemeyer said. With seating for 64, 
the restaurant features such specialties as calf's liver with cassis and 
shallots, grilled Cornish game hen stuffed with foie gras and wild rice and 
grilled swordfish with sun-dried tomato butter. Average tab: $20. 
</P>
<P>
Among other Bloomie's food service operations, Hellemeyer said, are Forty 
Carrots, a "healthy food" restaurant in which the store years ago introduced 
frozen yogurt to the New York market; Showtime Cafe, an upscale cafeteria 
similar to Cafe Casino, and Espresso Bar, "a Euro-chic Italian cafe" offering 
desserts, fresh pastas, salads and wines. 
</P>
<P>
The decision whether to offer food service is usually based on a store's 
location and bottom line. Store officials would not talk about their 
restaurants' financial results, but they acknowledged that food service is an 
expensive proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The food business "in general has lower margins than most other merchandise in 
a department store," said Ken Stevens, a consultant with the Los Angeles office 
of McKinsey &amp; Co. It comes down to a trade-off, with the retailer 
determining whether the intangible benefits of offering the service outweigh 
the reduced profitability. 
</P>
<P>
At Marshall Field's in Chicago, for instance, the legendary Walnut Room -- a 
restaurant in the old tradition -- is not considered a big profit maker "other 
than that it's a big draw," said Homer G. Sharp, head of central display. 
"Obviously, people go shopping while they're here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some End Food Service 
</P>
<P>
With a typical sit-down eatery costing between $500,000 and $1 million to 
install, many retailers, May Co. California among them, are inclined to put 
restaurants into free-standing stores but not into those mall locations served 
by a food court. Another consideration is space: New department stores tend to 
be far smaller than the huge stores of years past and have less space to spare 
for low-return businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Bonwit Teller, a fashion specialty store, has phased out its food business. 
Until its purchase by May Department Stores two years ago, Robinson's was 
making a big push into food service. Now, it has only three food outlets 
chain-wide, all of them leased. 
</P>
<P>
In designing its newest stores, including those in Los Angeles and Palm Desert, 
Bullock's left out restaurants. And when the chain remodeled its Santa Ana 
location, the restaurant was removed. 
</P>
<P>
The tearoom in Bullock's Pasadena, according to James B. Brooks, the store's 
general manager, is the chain's most profitable food service operation and 
lately has been expanding its successful banquet business. Even so, the tearoom 
recently eliminated its evening food service, primarily because of increased 
restaurant competition in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest proponents of food is Dayton Hudson Department Store Co., 
which claims to have the largest upscale food service among U.S. department 
stores, serving 12 million patrons a year. 
</P>

When Lovelace, the food service director, joined the company in 1982, he 
immediately set about developing new "upscale fast-food" concepts and 
transforming the company's traditional sit-down restaurants "to meet the needs 
of the customer of the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
Among other operations, the company came up with Yogurt Express, which 
generates a hefty $1,000 in sales per square foot (compared to about $200 for 
non-food merchandise) and is being rolled out to several of the company's 37 
stores; 700 Express, designed to serve customers quality fast food within 10 
minutes, and a combination of five quick food concepts that replaced the 
flagship Minneapolis store's traditional Sky Room and quickly tripled sales. 
The company is also expanding its 4-year-old Marketplace Foods, similar to 
Macy's Cellar in New York, with a substantial carry-out area. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting customers' rapidly changing palates, ethnic foods are playing a 
bigger role in Dayton Hudson's offerings. Forget the cling peach halves, 
cottage cheese and iceberg lettuce leaves of yore. New menus offer Morocco 
salad, made with boneless chicken breast and couscous ($6), and smoked salmon 
with radicchio, bibb lettuce, avocado, grapefruit, chopped egg and caviar, 
Dayton Hudson's most expensive salad at $7. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway, too, has found that its customers' changing tastes have forced it 
to adapt quickly to new trends. It recently closed a traditional sit-down 
restaurant at its Brea Mall store in favor of a deli service with lighter fare. 
"We . . . have seen a really remarkable response," said Richard F. Clayton, 
president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Food Is Fashion' 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Bullock's, the Broadway has put food service operations into its newest 
stores, but it also recently closed restaurants in Beverly Center and Baldwin 
Hills where it "couldn't come up with a formula that worked," Clayton said. The 
43-store chain now operates 24 food facilities, serving more than 2 million 
diners a year. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of transactions," Clayton said. "It's important because we touch 
a lot of customers." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food service, once the province of large department stores, has also 
spread to smaller specialty apparel boutiques such as Koala Blue, with its 
Australian-style milk bars; Fred Segal, which has restaurants at stores in 
Santa Monica and on Melrose Avenue; Merry Go Round, a chain selling young men's 
and women's apparel that is testing a '50s-style diner and soda fountain in a 
store in Denver, and Barneys, an exclusive women's clothier in Manhattan that 
has Le Cafe, a buffet and bistro bar with about 90 seats. 
</P>
<P>
To Dickinson of Nordstrom, the merging of menus and merchandise makes sense. 
"We consider ourselves a fashion retail store, and we believe food is fashion," 
he said. "There is tremendous opportunity for good dining."

Oil from a ruptured Shell Oil Co. pipeline floated down the Mississippi River 
and forced cleanup crews to work round the clock to try to limit effects of the 
spill, a Shell spokesman in St. Louis said. Missouri Department of Natural 
Resources officials said the spill -- the worst in the state's history -- began 
Dec. 24 when a pipeline at Vienna, Mo., ruptured, allowing at least 336,000 
gallons of dichlorobenzene, a petroleum product, to flow into the Gasconade 
River. The spill has not caused problems with water supplies, but state 
officials said they could not measure the long-term effects on fish and 
wildlife in the Gasconade, Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Shell spokesman 
Tony Canino said that the cold weather prevented the oil from clinging to the 
river banks.

The American Legion's top recruiter in California turned in more than 200 phony 
membership registrations, including ones for a former German soldier and people 
who were dead, according to a Legion report. Costa Mesa Post Cmdr. Robert 
Hanson could be expelled from the American Legion, said state Cmdr. Andrew J. 
Steffanic. A three-member Legion committee issued its findings in a 13-page 
report signed by Steffanic. Hanson, 67, declined to discuss the report, but 
said, "I am contemplating legal action." The state American Legion awarded 
Hanson its Recruiter of the Year award after Hanson submitted 801 new 
memberships between July 1, 1987, and the 1988 convention. But the 
investigation found that only 18 of the supposed applicants paid dues by check, 
while Hanson wrote about 25 checks to the Costa Mesa post for $8,249.60 from 
his own account. The investigation began after national headquarters received 
inquiries from people wondering why they were receiving the American Legion 
Magazine. Hanson told state Legion officials that the 801 membership 
applications were stolen Aug. 26 when someone broke into his car.

A missing teen-ager who authorities had stopped looking for over the protest of 
his parents was in fair condition after he was found wandering and disoriented 
in the Cleveland National Forest. Andrew Campbell, 15, of rural Guatay had been 
missing six days when he was found Friday in an oak grove by a father and son 
who had gone for a drive in the San Diego County backcountry. Campbell was 
suffering from minor frostbite.

Anti-terrorist police in London arrested several people in connection with the 
discovery two weeks ago of a major IRA bomb factory in the city. Police would 
not say how many people were rounded up or give further details of the 
operation. One man was arrested earlier after police found an apartment in 
south London full of bomb-making equipment and more than 100 pounds of Semtex 
explosives of the sort used by Irish Republican Army guerrillas fighting to end 
British rule in Northern Ireland. He was charged with conspiracy to cause 
explosions in Britain likely to endanger life.

A runaway commuter train barreled through the Bavarian countryside for 12 1/2 
miles after the engineer left it unattended to go to the bathroom, but forgot 
to set the brake, officials said. The train, which had no passengers at the 
time, finally was intentionally derailed. No one was hurt as the train traveled 
from Ebersberg to Wasserburg in upper Bavaria, roaring through 20 regular 
passenger stops during its 20-minute run, averaging 37 m.p.h., police added. 
The train was at the end of its usual commuter run.

Two men hired to monitor the performance of lottery ticket computers sued the 
California Lottery, complaining that officials ignored reports that computer 
problems were underreported. In the Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit, Emmitt 
A. Allison and Randy Troxel alleged that they were placed on administrative 
leave and reassigned in September after they took their complaints to the state 
controller's office. State lottery officials have said the allegations were 
investigated and were unfounded. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and a 
court order forbidding lottery officials from destroying documents supporting 
Allison's and Troxel's findings.

HOMELESS FAMILIES LEAVE SQUALID HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scrambling to meet its New Year's Eve deadline, New York City moved the last of 
448 homeless families from Manhattan's squalid Martinique Hotel. Located near 
Macy's department store, the turn-of-the-century hotel at Broadway and 32nd 
Street had become a national symbol of the problems faced by those too poor to 
afford housing. Faced with the threat of a federal funds cutoff and political 
pressure, Mayor Edward I. Koch's Administration pledged to close one of its 42 
welfare hotels by year's end. Koch has pledged to empty all the welfare hotels 
by July, 1990. The Martinique, where the city paid $1,800 per family, was 
closed first because it was "emblematic" of the conditions in other welfare 
hotels, said John Beckman, a city Human Resources Administration spokesman. 
Some of the relocated families were taken to newly rehabilitated apartments. 
Others were transfered to other city-run facilities for the homeless. The 
Martinique became a welfare hotel 15 years ago and at its height housed about 
500 adults and 1,500 children. It once featured a fashionable dancehall and 
popular nightclub.

More than 500 Tibetan university students defied a ban on demonstations in 
Lhasa and marched to the regional government headquarters calling for a 
"peaceful solution to the Tibetan problem." Tibetan and foreign sources said 
that the demonstrators from Lhasa University encountered no resistance from the 
massive Chinese police force in the capital and that there was no violence. The 
demonstration was in sharp contrast with an anti-Chinese, pro-independence 
rally Dec. 10 in which police fired on unarmed Tibetan Buddhist monks and 
onlookers, killing as many as eight people.

IN SEARCH OF AN IDENTITY;

<P>
AREA LACKS A SENSE OF COMMUNITY

Dick Haddon's church has an identity problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell people that the First United Methodist Church of Gardena is not in 
Gardena," the Rev. Haddon said, "and people just kind of stare in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Gardena, but it's not. Even the post office says 'Gardena,' but the 
reality is, we do not live in Gardena. . . . If we had a fire . . . the 
response would come from the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
That is a complicated fact of life in Harbor Gateway, the 8-mile long, 
4-block-wide umbilical cord acquired at the turn of the century to link Los 
Angeles to its port. 
</P>
<P>
In a city where community names conjure up images -- Venice, Silver Lake, Boyle 
Heights -- Harbor Gateway draws a blank. 
</P>
<P>
Bounded on the west by Gardena and Torrance and on the east by Carson and 
unincorporated county land, the area was for decades known as the "city strip," 
the "shoestring strip" or, simply, "the strip." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Area Rechristened 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the Los Angeles City Council rechristened the area to try to 
bring a sense of identity and community pride to its citizens -- some of whom 
do not even know they live in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Gateway lacks much of what makes a community a community -- no central 
business district, no civic center or gathering place, no library branch, no 
police station and, as Haddon noted, no post office. Its largest park is a 
cemetery. And, despite the new name, mailing addresses of residents remain 
unchanged. They still say Torrance or Gardena, not Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, this leaves some people confused. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'Look, my mailing address is Gardena,' " reported Gene Painter, the 
city of Gardena's superintendent of human services who said he does not turn 
away Harbor Gateway residents who ask for help. "Strange as it may seem, they 
don't know where they live." 
</P>
<P>
Optician Chris Toughill joined the Torrance Chamber of Commerce when he opened 
his shop in a Harbor Gateway strip mall, and his neighbors did the same. It 
wasn't until the Torrance mayor declined to attend their grand opening, 
Toughill said, that the merchants discovered that they were in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Even the young toughs of the Gardena 13 gang, interviewed while hanging out on 
a Harbor Gateway street corner, insisted they were standing in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
In population, Harbor Gateway is tied with Westwood as Los Angeles' 
second-fastest growing area. Sylmar is first. Between 1980 and 1986, according 
to Los Angeles Planning Department estimates, Harbor Gateway's population 
increased 15.6%, from 30,238 to 34,951. 
</P>
<P>
A drive through the Gateway is like a trip from the city to the suburbs. On the 
north end, which begins at El Segundo Boulevard, there are apartments needing 
repair, gang graffiti on walls and single-family homes with barred windows. The 
southern end -- which stops at Sepulveda Boulevard, where Harbor City begins -- 
is punctuated by newly built strip malls, condominiums and well-manicured 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Property values follow a similar pattern, with the lowest prices in the north. 
Home values in nearby Torrance or Gardena, however, are considerably higher. 
Real estate agents report that a house in Harbor Gateway might sell for as much 
as $50,000 less than one across the street in another community. 
</P>
<P>
Agents attribute the difference to better city services, particularly in 
Torrance, which has its own schools. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute you mention Los Angeles," said Gardena real estate agent John 
Warner, "it frightens . . . people away. It's just one of those things. Homes 
have always been cheaper over there (Harbor Gateway)." 
</P>
<P>
Said resident Betty Roy: "I hate to be known to live in the strip. When my 
friends ask where I live, I tell them Torrance." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, four years after the name change -- in spite of spiffy blue-and-white 
signs that declare "Harbor Gateway" below the Los Angeles city seal -- those 
who live and work there say they still feel betwixt and between, not fully a 
part of Los Angeles, Harbor Gateway or the bordering cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In Limbo' 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they complain that their new moniker has not brought with it what 
they really want: more attention from city officials, better services such as 
street cleaning and tree trimming and, above all, increased police protection. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like in limbo," said Roy, a longtime resident of the Gateway's southern 
end. "We're not really Torrance and we're not really Carson. . . . We're only 
here because Los Angeles needs this little piece of land to attach to the 
harbor. Nobody cares about us. . . . We're like the forgotten people." 
</P>
<P>
For Sylvia Figueroa, life on the border means a daily struggle at It's a 
Miracle, the Mexican pizza parlor she opened a year ago at Gardena Boulevard 
and Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Gardena is across the street, and the differences are stark. On the 
Gardena side, Gardena Boulevard -- that city's main business thoroughfare -- is 
getting a face lift. The street is clean, and the trees are neatly trimmed. 
City officials are offering grants to business owners for renovations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Contrasts 
</P>
<P>
Across the street in Los Angeles, the trees are scraggly and overgrown, 
vagrants sleep in a littered vacant lot, liquor stores abound and the Gardena 
13 gang seems to own the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"The other side there's no drunk people, no people looking for drugs," said 
Figueroa, who sweeps her sidewalk regularly. "The other side is so clean. Even 
the sidewalk is clean. 
</P>
<P>
"You see the street?" she asked, pointing to a pile of litter. "That's 
terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the area, 
conceded that the Gateway is not getting its share of services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to get a library in there, because no matter where you put a 
library in the Gateway, you only serve a limited number of city residents," she 
said. "It's difficult to get a street cleaning service on a regular basis 
because they have to come from somewhere else to get there. . . . It's not like 
having a nice, round community where you have something in the middle and it 
serves everybody around it." 
</P>
<P>
The United Way apparently agrees. In March, the umbrella agency's 
Harbor/Southeast division declared Harbor Gateway an "under-served geographic 
area," citing "real gaps in law enforcement" and social services. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration is part of a long-term plan by the United Way to upgrade Harbor 
Gateway by organizing neighborhood leaders to form nonprofit programs for 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
A citizens group, chaired by Haddon, is setting goals for the project, 
apparently marking the first time that community leaders around the Gateway 
have come together to talk about the area's problems. The minister and some 
others agree that the first goal should be improving community pride and 
cohesiveness to create political clout. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, residents must reverse 82 years of history. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, since the so-called Shoestring Strip Annexation of Dec. 26, 
1906, Harbor Gateway residents have somehow coalesced into five distinct 
neighborhoods. From north to south, their rough boundaries are El Segundo 
Boulevard to Rosecrans Avenue; Rosecrans to Redondo Beach Boulevard; Redondo 
Beach to Artesia Boulevard; Artesia to 190th Street; and 190th Street to 
Sepulveda Boulevard. The east-west boundaries of the three northern 
neighborhoods are Vermont Avenue and Figueroa Street, while Western and 
Normandie avenues bound the two in the south. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Harbor Gateway is a racially mixed, middle-income area, with an 
estimated median household income of $30,431 and a population that is 48.4% 
white, 13.2% black, 16.5% Asian and 21.8% other racial groups, according to the 
1980 census, the most recent statistics available. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos -- whose numbers are not tallied as part of the racial breakdown in the 
1980 census -- are Harbor Gateway's largest minority group, accounting for 
32.9% of the overall population, according to census data. 
</P>
<P>
However, the picture changes when the area is more closely examined. 
Demographic statistics show that the various Gateway neighborhoods often 
resemble adjacent communities more closely than they do one another. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the two Gateway neighborhoods near south South-Central Los Angeles 
and Compton have the heaviest concentration of blacks, 44.7%. Whites make up 
23.6% of those two neighborhoods, which extend north from Redondo Beach 
Boulevard, and Asians make up 6.9%. The estimated median household income there 
is $27,453. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Make-Up of Community 
</P>
<P>
But in the strip's midsection, from Artesia Boulevard to 190th Street, the 
population reflects that of the southern end of Gardena, which is heavily 
Asian. There, the black population is minuscule -- just 0.4% -- with most of 
the population split between whites, 48.1%, and Asians, 44.8%. Estimated 
household income in this section jumps dramatically, to $44,498. 
</P>
<P>
And south of 190th Street, approaching predominantly white Torrance, the white 
population jumps even higher, to 66.3%, while the Asian population dips to 8.6% 
and the number of blacks rises slightly, to 2%. Median household income is 
$27,607. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is primarily residential, the Gateway also includes a burgeoning 
business district at the San Diego and Harbor freeways, where, according to the 
California Department of Transportation, 500,000 cars drive by each day, making 
it the second-busiest intersection in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called 190th Street Corridor is a major drawing card for commercial 
developers, who have built about 5 million square feet of office space there in 
the last eight years. Gleaming high-rises with pleasant landscaping have 
replaced a Shell oil refinery and manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We sort of had a shift from the Industrial Age to the Information Age," said 
Howard Mann, president of Andrex Development Co., one of the area's major 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Mann predicts that the move away from industrial to commercial uses will help 
upgrade nearby areas by attracting home buyers who hold high-paying jobs in 
what he calls Harbor Gateway's "urban cluster." Already, he is planning a 
restaurant to meet that market, based on an analysis that, he said, "found that 
the average income per household within a 5-mile radius of this intersection is 
$50,000." 
</P>
<P>
Dining in elegance, however, is certainly not a priority farther north in 
Harbor Gateway, where large concentrations of undocumented Latinos residents 
are struggling to get by. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the United Way found that illegal Latino immigrants are the "most 
under-served" group in the Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
Haddon and other local leaders said their presence also makes it difficult to 
form neighborhood coalitions because illegal aliens fear they will attract 
unwanted attention from immigration authorities if they participate in 
community affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Their need is to be invisible," the minister said, "and that does not make for 
a good community." 
</P>
<P>
Haddon is particularly attuned to the problems of undocumented residents 
because his church runs the 3-year-old Harbor Gateway Center, one of only two 
social service agencies the United Way found serving the strip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center's Problems 
</P>
<P>
The center -- which offers a variety of nutritional, health and educational 
programs to about 1,500 people -- lacks money and staff. The executive director 
left more than a year ago when the money to pay her ran out. Haddon, who took 
the pastor's job in July, has been doing her job ever since. 
</P>
<P>
United Way officials say they would like to strengthen the center and also 
persuade social service agencies in neighboring communities to expand 
operations here. Their study showed that the area lacks adequate shelters for 
battered women, delinquency prevention programs, drug- and alcohol-abuse 
programs and crisis intervention centers. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one common thread in the complaints from Gateway residents, it is 
the increasing gang activity and the lack of police protection. Many said that 
they go for days without seeing a patrol car and that officers covering the 
area are often sent on calls elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officials said they have been trying to improve service, 
especially during the past year when citizens groups and Flores have pressed 
for additional patrols. But they also acknowledged that cars are called out of 
the area more often than they would like. Capt. Sandy Wasson of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Southeast Division, which covers the part of the strip 
north of the San Diego Freeway, took issue with residents who say Harbor 
Gateway gets less than its fair share of coverage. He said a recent deployment 
study showed that while the area has fewer patrol cars -- just one basic car in 
the north and one in the south -- it also has less crime. 
</P>
<P>
Wasson said he views Harbor Gateway as "a neighborhood in transition that's got 
great potential." He has encouraged the formation of neighborhood watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, for one, said she senses a growing participation in such groups and "a 
renewed interest in community improvement." 
</P>
<P>
She maintained that the city has improved services in recent years, especially 
police coverage. She also noted that a Harbor Gateway paramedic unit was 
established in June and that this year, the city Library Department finally 
included a proposal for a Harbor Gateway branch in its long-term plan. 
</P>
<P>
The councilwoman said she would like the Gateway to have its own post office 
and ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important," she said, "to have an actual tag and title on who you 
are and where you are." 
</P>
<P>
But she said she knows persuading the federal government will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Flores said, she is thankful for whatever recognition the new 
name has brought the area. 
</P>
<P>
"At least," she said, "I know that when I mention Harbor Gateway in City 
Council now, my colleagues know what I'm talking about."

LAWMEN STRIVE TO GET DRUNK DRIVERS OFF ROADS 
</P>

<P>
New Year's Eve party-goers who drink and drive faced a greater chance of 
beginning 1989 in jail as law enforcement officers fanned out in unusually 
heavy numbers Saturday to rid Southern California roadways of drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol, which reported one freeway traffic death blamed 
on a drunk driver late Friday, canceled days off for many officers so they 
could staff an "Operation Impaired Driver" task force in the downtown area New 
Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-officer unit, double the usual deployment against drunk drivers, 
concentrated on the heavily traveled freeways -- the Santa Monica, Harbor, 
Pasadena, Golden State and Hollywood -- that converge in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be out there just to look for drunken drivers, to stop them and arrest 
them," CHP Officer Diane Lowery said. "It means that there will also be more 
officers to assist any motorists needing help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roadblock in Burbank 
</P>
<P>
The CHP scheduled no New Year's Eve sobriety checkpoints, but at least one 
local law enforcement agency, the Burbank Police Department, planned a 
roadblock to snare drunk drivers beginning about one hour before dark at an 
undisclosed location, Police Lt. Don Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers stopped 800 drivers at a sobriety checkpoint Friday night in 
Baldwin Park, arresting five on suspicion of driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Los Angeles set up a van that houses their Immediate Booking and 
Release System behind Parker Center police headquarters, where it was to be in 
operation from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic officers throughout the city planned "maximum deployment," utilizing 
all available officers and assigning them specially to look for motorists under 
the influence of alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agencies Beef Up Patrols 
</P>
<P>
Several law agencies in Orange County also planned beefed-up patrols. In Costa 
Mesa, seven two-officer teams will look for drunk drivers, then put them behind 
bars with the help of specially assigned jail personnel, Police Sgt. Tom Winter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP reported one alcohol-related traffic death about 11 p.m. Friday, six 
hours into the agency's holiday fatality reporting period that ends midnight 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rene Rodriquez, 21, was booked on suspicion of felony drunk driving and 
vehicular manslaughter after the fiery crash on the Harbor Freeway near El 
Segundo Boulevard in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Rodriquez drove his Datsun 280Z onto the freeway at about 
100 m.p.h. When he swerved to avoid other traffic, the car struck the center 
divider and flipped on its side, skidding along the cement divider for 250 
yards as it burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passenger Dies 
</P>
<P>
A passenger, Raul Trevino, 28, of Lawndale, was trapped inside the car and 
killed. Rodriquez escaped with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP recorded four traffic deaths during the New Year's holiday period last 
year in Los Angeles County. Statewide, 43 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers arrested 467 people for suspected drunk driving in Los Angeles 
County last year and made 1,874 arrests statewide.

2 MEN SLAIN AS 1988 SHOOTINGS SET A RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two young men were killed and four people wounded as drive-by gunmen and street 
gangs marked the beginning of the long holiday weekend with a series of 
shootings, ending 1988 with record mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend's first fatal shooting occurred at 9 p.m. Friday in South Los 
Angeles, where Raymond Smith, 21, was shot and killed, apparently by occupants 
of a passing car, as he stood in the 200 block of West 84th Street, Lt. Bob 
Hansohn said. Nearby, 20 minutes later, Adam Lopez, 16, was shot to death from 
a passing car as he walked out of a liquor store at 54th and Hoover streets. 
</P>
<P>
The two shootings were not believed to be related. Hansohn, of the 77th Street 
Division, said no suspects had been taken into custody but the shootings "would 
probably turn out to be" gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
Three other shootings, all in an area west of downtown, were apparently 
retaliatory attacks involving two rival gangs, Sgt. Ray Heslop of the Rampart 
Division said Saturday. Those shootings left four people wounded, two of them 
critically. 
</P>
<P>
Heslop said Edward Moran, 21, of Tujunga, was driving past a group of men 
gathered on a front porch on Witmer Street between 3rd and 6th streets at 11:30 
p.m. Friday, when they yelled out gang slogans and fired three shots, Heslop 
said. Moran was hit once in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Ramon Gomez, 24, was standing at the corner of Temple Street and 
Edgeware Road at 1 a.m. Saturday when two men drove past in a car and fired 
three shots from a small caliber revolver, Heslop said. He was wounded in the 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
Heslop said the shooting "was apparently" by the same gang members who had 
fired at Moran from the sidewalk and who had gotten into a car to continue the 
gunplay. 
</P>
<P>
A third shooting, possibly related to the first two, occurred at 2:30 a.m. near 
Crown Hill Street and Loma Drive when several shots were fired from an unknown 
source into a group of young men and women, critically wounding a man in the 
arm and back, and a woman in the chest and back, Heslop said. 
</P>
<P>
Both victims were taken to the County-USC Medical Center. Their names were not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The killings in the 77th Street Division were not included in either the 
Sheriff's or Police Department's preliminary statistics, which indicated 1988 
would end with record totals of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department reported 207 gang killings in the first 10 months of the 
year, a 24.7% jump over the 166 in the same period of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department, which patrols unincorporated areas of Los Angeles 
County and contracts its services to smaller cities, reported 94 gang killings 
in 1988, an 18.1% increase over 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Although police statistics were available only through October, the sheriff's 
report, issued Friday, backed up statements by Sheriff Sherman Block that gang 
violence was on a dramatic rise.

THE YEAR THE AMERICAN MOVIE CAME BACK; 
</P>
<P>
'ACCIDENTAL TOURIST' TOPS THE TIMES' CRITIC'S 10 BEST OF 1988 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON

<TEXT>
<P>
There are years when a look back over the year's most significant films for 
that arbitrary ten comes with what one writer once called that nasty ratcheting 
sound made by scraping the bottom of the barrel. Then there are years when each 
move to pare down to only 10 brings hours of remorse and deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
And oddly enough, this was one of those killer years. As it warmed up, 1988 may 
not have seemed fated to be an extra superbly choicest year, if you could grade 
movies the way they grade tea. But it gained momentum after a slow first half 
until finally the year could be chalked up as fat, full and innovative. 
</P>
<P>
You cannot fault innovation, not in the same calendar year that marked "Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit" and "Little Dorrit," but full is certainly a big part of 
that equation. Between new screens cropping up like mushrooms after a rain and 
the insatiable maw of video, which insists that movies at least curtsy on a big 
screen before being gulped down into the small one, we are seeing roughly 60 
more films now than we did in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
When you are staring, dumbfounded, at the marshamallowed dimensions of a film 
like "Zelly and Me" it can seem a particularly high psychic price to pay, 
simply to fill more theater screens. Particularly when some of the theaters are 
roughly the size of an airline washroom, and flood with light whenever 
late-comers shuffle into to one of their 45 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Then a film like "The Chocolate War" gets its crack at one of those screens, 
giving audiences a chance to discover the strengths of its astonishingly 
assured young debuting director, Keith Gordon, and it all seems worth it again. 
</P>
<P>
1988 may be remembered as the point at which the quintessentially American 
movie came back into its own, giving us the outright delights of "Punchline," 
"Bull Durham," "Big," "8 Men Out," "Roger Rabbit," "Dominick and Eugene," 
"Tucker" or " Working Girl." 
</P>
<P>
It was also the year for films adapted from exceptionally knotty books, and 
succeed or fail, the determination involved in "The Unbearable Lightness of 
Being," "The Accidental Tourist," "Little Dorrit," "The Milagro Beanfield War," 
"Pelle the Conqueror" and "The Last Temptation of Christ" had to be admired. 
</P>
<P>
Art, music and even food had their day on the screen with "The Moderns," 
"Vincent," "Bird" "Long Live the Lady" and "Babette's Feast." By and large, 
films with urgent social or political issues still came with passports or not 
at all: "A World Apart," "Hotel Terminus: the Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," 
"A Cry in the Dark," "Salaam Bombay!" In some cases it was a foreign-born 
director who took on American social issues, the case of "Betrayed" and 
"Mississippi Burning." 
</P>
<P>
The 10 films that impressed me most this year are below, ranked in order, with 
special notice that "Punchline" very nearly threw the whole matter into a tie. 
So, the runner up-list is a hair's breath one this year. 
</P>
<P>
1. "It's not just how much you love someone," William Hurt as a grieving father 
muses in "The Accidental Tourist," "it's who you are when you're with them." 
Director-co-writer Lawrence Kasdan has made watching this man come alive, 
perhaps for the first time, into a small-scale epiphany. What's startling is 
how this story, which takes place during Hurt's second year of mourning, can be 
as funny as it is. However, like Anne Tyler's singular book, the humor comes 
from character and the family Hurt springs from is memorable enough to have 
escaped from Dickens. Among the excellent ensemble, all of whom seem to have a 
decidedly droll bent and a knack for underplaying, you can find the 
irresistible Geena Davis. She plays a dog obedience trainer to whom Hurt's 
Welsh corgi, Edward, takes an enormous shine. It's entirely understandable. 
</P>
<P>
2. "Little Dorrit's" virtues are not simply its off-handed display of the cream 
of British actors: Derek Jacobi, Alec Guinness, Miriam Margolyes, Roshan Seth, 
Joan Greenwood, Eleanor Bron, Cyril Cusack, but the toughness and 
accomplishment with which director Christine Edzard's adaptation makes Dickens 
as pertinent as this week's stock-fixing headlines. 
</P>
<P>
The qualities which made George Bernard Shaw call the novel "more seditious 
than "Das Kapital" are here in abundance and Edzard asks that we see the story 
in two films, six hours in all; however her method is not epic but intimate. By 
the time we have come to Dorrit's triumphant conclusion, the faces, and voices 
of London at that time, the working poor as well as the drawling rich, have 
been stamped upon us forever. 
</P>
<P>
3. "A Cry in the Dark" is an angry film, an outraged one really, as director 
Fred Schepisi lays out the almost unbelieveable path of Australian 
jurisprudence and/or media hijinks by which a bereft mother became, in the eyes 
of the public, the ritual killer of her own infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Its power comes from Schepisi's blend of passion and detachment and from the 
best performance Meryl Streep has given so far. (Do we seem to write this each 
year? If so, it's true -- this is a talent you can watch deepen and become 
further refined with each role.) Streep has a perfectly matched thoroughbred 
opposite her in Sam Neill; he makes this Seventh Day Adventist pastor's fall 
from smugness and self-assurance a wracking business. 
</P>
<P>
4. "Salaam, Bombay!" throws us into the life of Bombay's street kids with an 
ebullience and an energy that's matched exactly by the film's tough-mindedness. 
Director Mira Nair asks for no pity for her urchins and she doesn't romanticize 
them either, but there is no way you cannot be haunted by them. "Salaam 
Bombay!" is not Nair's first film about exploitation as a way of life in 
India's cities, but it is her first non-documentary and she brings to her work 
a wonderful eye and a truly cinematic flair for story telling. As you leave 
10-year old Krishna, you may be reminded of "The 400 Blows," sacrilegious as 
that may sound. But "Salaam Bombay!" didn't win Nair the Camera D'Or at Cannes 
in 1988, for best new director, for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
5. In a year of largely literal films, the poetry of Wim Wenders' "Wings of 
Desire" soars, on the wings of his two Berliner angels, with Peter Handke's 
screenplay and with the camera of Henri Alekan, who might be considered 
something of an expert on black and white fairy tales, since it was he who also 
photographed "Beauty and the Beast." Peter Falk gives the film a wry, gutsy 
center, but its essence is its passionate declaration of the need for trust, 
love and commitment; a cheerfully anachronistic, contagiously optimistic tack. 
6. In a way, Austrian director Percy Adlon was working on the same wavelength 
in "Bagdad Cafe" that Wenders was in "Wings of Desire," although Adlon was 
playing a little more with the elements of personal discovery. Those qualities 
make "Bagdad Cafe" a slow-burning fuse, whose charm grows on you like its great 
and haunting song, "I'm Calling You." 
</P>
<P>
Its story of two heartily unalike women, the American CCH Pounder, the Bavarian 
Marianne Sagebrecht, who meet and join forces against a largely disinterested 
world in the California desert, depends largely on the charm of ex-cabaret 
artist Sagebrecht and long-time theater actress Pounder. Both of them are 
exceptional, but Sagebrecht carries a special something extra, as anyone who 
saw her in "Sugarbaby" will remember. 
</P>
<P>
7. Ostensibly about a "failed" car manufacturer, "Tucker," is Francis Ford 
Coppola's tribute to America's loners, its dreamers, whether they make 
ballpoint pens, or vast unflyable airplanes like the film's enigma, Howard 
Hughes. (Or, by the smallest stretch, if they make roundly disliked movies.) 
Loose-limbed and innovative, fueled by a full-throttle performance by Jeff 
Bridges as Tucker, it's a film that could have used more of the darker tones of 
Tucker's life -- heaven knows there were enough of them. But scenes like the 
launching of "The car of tomorrow, today" or the mysterioso meeting between 
Tucker and Dean Stockwell's Howard Hughes do a lot toward shutting down minor 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
8. The beauty and control David Cronenberg uses to tell his melancholy, macabre 
tale of symbiotic twin doctors in "Dead Ringers" shows the director at a new 
high of maturity, and Jeremy Irons' dual portrayal as one bordering on the 
eerie. Dealing, again, with the body, its mysteries and its final frightening 
independence from what we would have it do, "Dead Ringers"' twins are loosely 
based on a real Manhattan pair, but they are more plainly metaphors for any 
relationship that begins in love and ends in pathology. To think of a film this 
assured, this unified and this dizzyingly potent, you have to go back to "Blue 
Velvet." 
</P>
<P>
9. "Red Sorghum" makes you suspect that its director, 37-year old Zhang Yimou, 
was cinema-doomed from the cradle: His saga, which ends during the Japanese 
invasion of China, is part folk-tale, part love story and completely thrilling 
to behold. To credit this as Zhang's directorial debut is not to tell the whole 
story: before this he has also been a masterly cinematographer ("Yellow Earth," 
"The Big Parade) and an actor whose performance in "The Old Well" won him first 
prize at Tokyo's Film Festival. It's especially interesting to see a film from 
modern China with the scale and sensibilities about nature of the Kurosawa of 
"Dersu Uzala." 
</P>
<P>
10. After you see "A World Apart" you realize that the great film about South 
Africa is still waiting to be made. However, this personal one, the homage by a 
daughter to her martyred mother -- the first white woman jailed under South 
Africa's 90-day detention law -- as empathetically directed by Chris Menges, is 
a firm step in that direction. Three memorably fine performances came out of 
this: Barbara Hershey and young Jodhi May as mother and daughter; Linda Mvusi 
as their housekeeper. If somehow the facts of existence in South Africa had 
escaped you, " A World Apart" might be the perfect place to start. 
</P>
<P>
Those hotly close runners-up are "Punchline," "The Moderns," "Babette's Feast," 
"8 Men Out," "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," "Last Temptation of 
Christ," "Hotel Terminus: the Life and times of Klaus Barbie," "Track 29," 
"Vincent" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit."

MORE FILM FAVORITES OF 1988 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being" -- It was a year of superb novel 
adaptations, "Little Dorrit" included. But Milan Kundera's tale of love, 
politics, sex and repression in '60s-'70s Czechoslovakia was fashioned here, by 
director Philip Kaufman, into a genuine watershed American film: A startling 
departure -- in form, style, psychological and social content -- from almost 
all of the '80s' mainline U.S. studio product. 
</P>
<P>
"The Last Temptation of Christ" -- Did most of the people who kicked up the 
fuss really see Martin Scorsese's movie -- or understand what they saw? From 
Kazantzakis' novel, a firmly Christian work of high idealism, beautifully 
mounted, not intentionally lewd or blasphemous; only Paul Schrader's 
street-tough dialogue keeps it from being a masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
"Melo" -- Henri Bernstein's tense play about a tragic quadrangle in a world of 
classical musicians: The very title suggests "melodrama," and director Alain 
Resnais has defiantly refused to "open it up." Never moving from an obvious 
proscenium set, it somehow seems to distill the soul of theater, the beating 
heart of 1929 Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"Wings of Desire" -- Writer Peter Handke, master cinematographer Henri Alekan 
and director Wim Wenders -- cinematic poet of alienated loners on the road -- 
create an eerie, rapt modern fairy tale in which Berlin angels watch over the 
monochrome world of the lost and lonely and yearn for the bright colored day of 
passion, circuses and love. 
</P>
<P>
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit" -- A monstrous high-voltage audience-hit from 
director Robert Zemeckis, that, like John McTiernan's "Die Hard," was also a 
technical marvel. I'd like the last trip to Toonvile to be more surrealistic, 
crazier; otherwise, it doesn't miss a trick. 
</P>
<P>
"A Taxing Woman" -- Through the Byzantine financial catacombs of modern Japan, 
a piquant tax investigator pursues a swaggering cheat. Director Juzo Itami 
("Tampopo,") gives us a wry, piercing, hawk-eyed view of his country's new 
commercialism, its loss of tradition and the samurai heart that seems to beat 
beneath it's plexiglass shield. 
</P>
<P>
"The Moderns" -- Supposedly it takes place in the expatriate's Paris of 1926, 
but actually this movie -- drifting along on its cloud of soft jazz, 
overlapping banter and wine-rich colors -- is set in no real landscape at all. 
A sweet, devious meditation on art, love, life and artifice; the most special 
and delightful of Alan Rudolph's films. 
</P>
<P>
"Tucker" -- Cars and conspiracies, invention and intimidation, flash and free 
enterprise; Francis Coppola strongly reclaims his turf. A full-throated shout 
of American optimism, tinged with fatalism and a canny awareness of the traps 
awaiting any dreamer. 
</P>
<P>
"Bird" -- A jazz lover's dream: A song in darkness, joy wrung out of grief. No 
director this year showed more devotion to his/her subject matter than Clint 
Eastwood in this soulful elegy to Charlie Parker and the world of '40s-'50s 
be-bop. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Live the Lady!" -- A neglected little gem, by Ermanno Olmi, that I like 
as much as the better-known culinary fable "Babette's Feast" (not to mention 
its wonderful Danish compatriot, "Pelle the Conqueror"). It's a community 
comedy about lower-class waiters at a lavish Italian mountaintop business 
banquet; a feast that becomes, like Babette's, a metaphor for all the traps of 
society, all the divisions of life.

<P>
1988: IT WAS A BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
BUT LATC -- AND OTHERS -- CAME THROUGH WITH STRONG SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A surprising amount of good work got done in Los Angeles theater in 1988, 
considering that it was a war year. 
</P>
<P>
For months, Actors' Equity and the smaller theaters fought out the question of 
how to compensate Waiver actors. This at least established the principle that 
Waiver actors deserved compensation. But it also used up a lot of energy. By 
year's end, you had to hope that the Waiver wars were winding down: Everybody 
was sick of them. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the smaller theaters got on with it. A fine young writer named Jamie 
Baker had a double debut. His "Don't Go Back to Rockville" was first seen at 
the Pacific Theatre Ensemble, then at the Victory Theatre. Set in 1944, it 
concerned a surly young Kentucky Derby jockey named Ed (Andrew Philpot). His 
unaffectionate progeny turned up a few months later at the Tamarind Theater in 
Baker's "South Central Rain." 
</P>
<P>
Ed and his nasty-nice spawn didn't have a lot to recommend them as human 
beings, but they had a sneaky vitality as stage characters. They suggested 
Lanford Wilson's Talley clan, except that they didn't come off as "characters," 
but as people with real needs -- even if selfish ones. Volume Three of this 
family saga is awaited with interest. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Lima also hit the mark with "El Salvador" at the Gnu Theatre. The scene 
here was a hotel room from which a group of journalists were trying to cover 
the war in El Salvador without getting their heads shot off, and the message 
was that this kind of life can get to be addictive. An oddly effective 
combination of "The Front Page" and "Apocalypse Now," tautly directed by the 
Gnu's Jeff Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
It was an election year, and the Bush-Dukakis debates provided playacting of a 
dim sort. But there weren't many overtly political plays. Jeff Goldsmith's 
"McCarthy" at the Odyssey came closest, a somewhat overwritten script, but with 
two lean and mean performances: Victor Brandt as Tail Gunner Joe and Ralph 
Seymour as Roy Cohn. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS remained a scourge. "Jerker" -- the notorious script by Robert Chesley 
that the FCC had found pornographic when it was performed on KPFK -- got a live 
production at the Fifth Estate Theatre. It ended with a tired voice saying, 
over a Judy Garland record, that he couldn't come to the phone right now but 
please leave a message. No more needed to be said. 
</P>
<P>
In larger theaters, the best work, and certainly the most work, was done by the 
Los Angeles Theatre Center. Not everything that LATC attempted came off, but 
each of its shows had a reason for being and left a sense that somebody at the 
theater was in its corner. 
</P>
<P>
LATC introduced us to two playwrights with imagination and control, Jose Rivera 
and Marlane Meyer. Rivera was born in Puetro Rico, and his "The Promise" was a 
wild juxtaposition of family drama and tall tale, set in a world as real as a 
rusty muffler, yet a world where demons came and went. Marlane Meyer gave us 
two plays, "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish." The first brought back to life the 
cliche of the girl who goes to the dogs when she tries to break into the 
movies. Meyer's script worked because it dealt with the grungy Hollywood that 
actually exists, as opposed to the Oz of popular imagination; and because Meyer 
didn't waste any time sentimentalizing over Etta. (Actress Deirdre O'Connell 
didn't sentimentalize her, either.) 
</P>
<P>
"Kingfish" concerned a non-existent dog who nonetheless existed, since it was 
to the interest of certain parties that he do so. This could have been a 
terribly precious play. Perhaps the conceptual framework imposed on it by 
director David Schweizer was a bit precious. But, again, Meyer knew her people. 
She knew, for instance, that a lonely bachelor (Buck Henry) might covet a son 
(Merritt Butrick) so badly that he would pay to have one. This script didn't go 
any farther out than human behavior does. We're just not used to seeing it go 
this far in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
LATC also took on the Russians. Stein Winge's nightmarish production of "The 
Inspector General" got all tangled up in its bedclothes, but Ron Campbell 
proved wonderfully idiotic in the lead. Charles Marowitz's staging of "The Sea 
Gull" was dead-on: a production that called Chekhov's characters to account, 
rather than issuing them a blanket pardon because they were all so sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bushnell's staging of Alexander Galin's "Stars in the Morning Sky" didn't 
redeem a pedestrian script about some played-out whores in "protective custody" 
during the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Nevertheless, as with "Sarcophagus" in '87, 
the play was an interesting theater event -- further proof that Soviet 
playwrights no longer have to pretend that they live in Utopia. 
</P>
<P>
This was the pattern at LATC last year: Even when the play fell short, the 
viewer could grab onto something. Another example: Chloe Webb's exuberant 
performance as the schizophrenic daughter in "The Model Apartment." LATC is on 
a roll these days: You can feel the energy in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The only time you felt that energy in the Mark Taper Forum lobby in '88 was 
after "The Colored Museum." Younger viewers, black and white, had been 
exhilarated by the anger in George C. Wolfe's script, while older people 
suspected that Wolfe was reviving the hurtful black stereotypes of the past, 
under the guise of satirizing them. 
</P>
<P>
Few other Taper plays proved so stimulating: Certainly not its yuppified 
production of George Walker's "Nothing Sacred." It was good to see Joe Chaikin 
back at Taper, Too. Director Robert Woodruff kept Sam Shepard's loose-jointed 
"A Lie of the Mind" all in one piece. Ron Taylor gave a tremendous supporting 
performance in 
</P>
<P>
"Lost Highway." But it was a season that said "Me, too" rather than, as in the 
old days at the Taper, "Look at this!" Or are we romanticizing the old days? 
</P>
<P>
"Fences" was the Doolittle's big hit, with James Earl Jones even more resonant 
than he had been on Broadway, and Lynne Thigpen taking no garbage as his wife. 
Another August Wilson play, "Joe Turner's Come and Gone," played the Old Globe 
Theatre prior to Broadway, with Delroy Lindo as a self-flaying fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Playhouse, once given up for dead, had a fine year. Amanda McBroom 
starred in the splendid "Lies and Legends," based on Harry Chapin's songs. The 
show later transferred to Beverly Hills. We can't understand why Robert 
Harling's beauty-parlor comedy "Steel Magnolias" didn't make a similar 
transfer. Barbara Rush and the rest of the cast loved doing it, the audience 
loved watching it, and even a critic had to acknowledge that behind the sitcom 
rhythms, there was a genuine admiration here for the way women can get it 
together. 
</P>
<P>
As opposed to men. Jules Feiffer's "Carnal Knowledge" at the Playhouse had 
Gregory Harrison and David Marshall Grant as two guys who treat women like The 
Enemy, and end up sandbagging themselves. This was also the predicament of Sean 
Penn, Danny Aiello and the other scuzzy Hollywood guys in "Hurlyburly," staged 
by playwright David Rabe at the Westwood Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Disgracefully, the "Hurlyburly" company canceled a performance just before 
curtain-time, the excuse being that their friend Gary Busey had just had a 
motorcycle accident. The professional reaction, in this circumstance, is to 
dedicate the performance to your friend and go on. Nonetheless, Penn and his 
colleagues -- including Mare Winningham as the toughest of their lady friends 
-- gave "Hurlyburly" one hell of a ride. 
</P>
<P>
The funniest classical revival of the year was South Coast Repertory's "School 
for Scandal," which director Paul Marcus set in a strange land where 
18th-Century types read the National Enquirer. SCR also brought us an urgent 
revival of "The Crucible," directed by Martin Benson -- one of those shows 
where the audience gasps even when it knows what's coming next. In San Diego, 
the show of the year was the San Diego Repertory Theatre's "Red Noses," Peter 
Barnes' black comedy about the uses of comedy in a bad time. Co-produced with 
the Dell'Arte Players of Blue Lake, Calif., the production combined expert 
clowning and scathing satire. Only one show gave us more pure pleasure during 
1988 -- the Moscow Circus.

POP EYE: CLINKERS AMONG THE POP NOTES OF '88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody hooted last January when Texas record producer (and legendary 
self-promoter) Major Bill Smith concocted an Elvis Presley birthday tribute, 
"Hey! Big E. Happy 53!," claiming The King had faked his death so he could live 
in anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
But Major Bill had the last laugh. In a year when Brian Wilson, Patti Smith and 
Jimmy Page's comebacks flopped, Elvis had the biggest revival of all, making 
tabloid headlines, starring in Priscilla's best-seller and being celebrated in 
a musical about his life. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, you got the feeling Elvis was on tour again -- popping 
up at Burger Kings in Kalamazoo, car washes in Georgia and the parking lot of a 
Las Vegas hotel. In August, WCVG in Cincinnati switched to an all-Elvis format. 
In September, Cheap Trick's "Don't Be Cruel" became the first Elvis re-make to 
go Top 10. In November, Priscilla and Lisa Marie did an Olds ad. In December, 
an L.A. Elvis impersonator announced plans to turn his San Fernando Valley home 
into a mock Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
Even without Elvis, 1988 was a banner year for pop follies. So let's celebrate 
the music world's clown princes in our yearly round-up of dubious achievements, 
inglorious moments and show-biz scams. 
</P>
<P>
PRESENTER OF THE YEAR: Beach Boy Mike Love, who livened up the 1988 Rock and 
Roll Hall of Fame Awards by noisily blasting Mick Jagger: "We did 180 
performances last year. . . . I'd like to see Mick Jagger get on stage and do 
'I Get Around' rather than 'Jumpin' Jack Flash.' Mick's always been chicken to 
get on stage with the Beach Boys." 
</P>
<P>
JAIL SENTENCE: To the Yugoslav folk singer who was sentenced to 60 days in jail 
and fined $80 for refusing to sing "Comrade Tito, We Pledge to You That We Will 
Not Swerve From Your Path," an official state song glorifying Marshal Tito, 
founder of the country's Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
PRINCE FAN: Richard Nixon, who titled his latest political tract "1999." 
</P>
<P>
NATIONAL ANTHEM PERFORMANCE: Saxophonist Kenny G, whose anthem rendition at the 
sixth game of the National League playoffs here was blasted as "unbelievably 
terrible" by Dodger second baseman Steve Sax. "I can't believe it. It was the 
worst I ever heard. I could have played it better than he did," said Sax, who 
was so upset that he shook his fist at G while walking back to the dugout. 
Dodger right fielder Mike Marshall added: "It was a disgrace to America." 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE, PART 1: Debbie Gibson: "On Halloween, I had a party where we had a 
seance. We tried to contact Liberace and Sid Vicious." 
</P>
<P>
DRUG BUST: Reporting that soul legend James Brown was charged for possession of 
the hallucinogenic drug PCP after a car chase through two states this fall, 
Rolling Stone quoted a Georgia Highway patrolman who said that when arrested, 
Brown "started singing 'Georgia' and was doing his 'Good Foot' dance when we 
gave him the sobriety test." 
</P>
<P>
GRAMMY ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: Best Female Country Vocal Performance winner K.T. 
Oslin, who told the press: "I'm so excited that I feel like I'm going to throw 
up any minute now." 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC ADDRESS ANNOUNCER: Paul Strelzin, announcer for the Texas League's El 
Paso Diablos, was ejected from a game against the Jackson Mets after 
infuriating umpires by repeatedly playing the verse "I've been cheated, been 
mistreated" from Linda Ronstadt's "When Will I Be Loved" after a series of 
close calls at first base. 
</P>
<P>
BACKSTAGE STIFF: When ex-Ollie North secretary Fawn Hall asked to meet Bruce 
Springsteen backstage at his Washington concert, she received a note saying: "I 
didn't think much of Ollie North, so why should I want to meet his secretary?" 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE, PART 2: Terence Trent D'Arby: "I've had three lives: The first time I 
was an Ethiopian pirate around 600 BC. Then I was an 18th-Century painter. The 
last time I was a very talented but unsuccessful country and Western singer." 
</P>
<P>
RAMONES FAN: Celebrated Manhattan preppie-killer Robert Chambers. He donned a 
shoulder-length wig and imitated Ramones leader Joey Ramone singing "Rockaway 
Beach" on a videotape that an ex-girlfriend sold to a local New York TV 
station, which aired the clip earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
SUBPOENA: When contestants in a lawsuit involving former MCA artist Donnie Iris 
couldn't persuade MCA Records chairman Irving Azoff to testify in a lawsuit 
hearing, they served the industry mogul with a subpoena at the Forum during 
half time of a Lakers-Spurs playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
DEEJAY: After the Baltimore Orioles lost 10 straight games, Baltimore morning 
deejay Bob Rivers swore he would stay locked in his WIYY-FM studio until the 
team won a game. He ended up stuck on the air for 258 straight hours until the 
team ended its record 21-game losing streak last April. 
</P>
<P>
WORST BAND NAME: Johnny Hates Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
MOLL: Dolly Parton, who totes a gun -- legally -- and said she pulled it out of 
her purse when accosted by a man when she was walking in New York this summer. 
"I pointed it at him and told him if he didn't take a hike, I'd turn him into a 
soprano." 
</P>
<P>
LED ZEPPELIN FAN: Spago impresario Wolfgang Puck, who apparently forgot that 
Jimmy Page was the band's guitar hero. When ex-Zeppelin singer Robert Plant was 
in town for a summer concert appearance, Puck presented him with a 
guitar-shaped pizza. 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE, PART 3: Washington Wife crusader Tipper Gore: "I love rock 'n' roll. I 
was one of the earliest Springsteen fans. I played drums in high school. You're 
talking to someone who really understands rock music." 
</P>
<P>
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: During last year's February sweeps, KABC-TV ballyhooed a 
chat with ex-Beatle George Harrison as an "exclusive" interview -- even though 
Harrison complained throughout the story about "all these interviews" he had 
been doing. 
</P>
<P>
MANAGER: Doc McGhee, whose management firm handles such pop superstars as Bon 
Jovi and Motley Crue, pleaded guilty last January to importing 40,000 pounds of 
marijuana, worth $9 million, into the United States. The indictment came weeks 
after McGhee and partner Doug Thaler were named personal managers of the year 
in Pollstar magazine's Readers Poll Awards. 
</P>
<P>
OVERSTATEMENT: When the American Cinematheque screened the rarely seen Sex 
Pistols documentary, "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle" in January, festival 
organizers ballyhooed the showing as "the last U.S. screening ever." This came 
as a surprise to Julien Temple, the film's director, who quipped: "What are 
they going to do -- burn it?" 
</P>
<P>
FRAGRANCE: John Lennon's first wife, Cynthia, took advantage of the hoopla 
surrounding her late husband by launching a new fragrance, Woman perfume. The 
fragrance was named after the song "Woman," from Lennon's "Double Fantasy" 
album, even though the ballad was written for Yoko Ono, the woman Lennon left 
Cynthia to marry. 
</P>
<P>
REUNION: When the Stray Cats held a press conference in August to herald the 
band getting back together after a four-year layoff, the group somehow 
neglected to mention that they had recorded a reunion album two years ago -- 
which stiffed. 
</P>
<P>
MAGAZINE ISSUE: Spin magazine's November issue, which contained a free condom 
in each copy as a symbol of the editors' support for safe sex practices.

L.A. BEAT: BEST OF '88 WON'T SHATTER ANY TRENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If your great-aunt's bridge club donned leather cycle duds and power-chorded 
its way through songs about life in the gutter, it'd probably stand a good 
chance of getting a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the way it seems, considering the hard-rock feeding frenzy on 
the part of record companies in the wake of Guns N' Roses' multi-platinum 
breakthrough. And with Geffen having snapped up such promising bands as Little 
Caesar and Junkyard, there's no reason to think that frenzy won't continue well 
into 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the continually healthy street-metal crowd had much competition this 
year: 
</P>
<P>
The best thing you could say about the rest of the L.A. rock scene in 1988 was 
that nothing really coalesced into any kind of movement that would be easy for 
trendoids and sycophants to glom onto, meaning that many worthy acts around 
town were free to develop on their own and not worry about fitting into a 
"scene." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the worst thing about the L.A. rock scene in 1988 was that 
nothing new really coalesced into any kind of movement that would produce an 
irresistible buzz, meaning that many worthy acts around town didn't get the 
attention they deserved. 
</P>
<P>
After all, what does it say about the vitality of the local club circuit when 
one of the brightest pop hopes to emerge from L.A. in 1988 -- Melissa Etheridge 
-- determined that playing the clubs was a waste of time and elected to build 
her career through playing beach community taverns? 
</P>
<P>
And who would have thought that the local independent act to get the most media 
attention would be Ailee Willis "discoverees," the Del Rubio Triplets, three 
middle-aged sisters who apply their harmonies to the likes of "Walk Like an 
Egyptian" and Willis' "Neutron Dance," and make most of their concert 
appearances at nursing and retirement homes? 
</P>
<P>
There are, though, two promising trends that began to emerge in '88: Nu Folk 
(the name's gotta go) and the latest edition of L.A. psychedelia. 
</P>
<P>
Such clubs as Bogart's, Club Lingerie and the Music Machine suddenly swung open 
their doors to acoustic troubadours, while new clubs like the Breakaway and the 
Gaslight were created specifically for that low-key approach. (The revived Ash 
Grove couldn't make it, though.) 
</P>
<P>
Nu names to watch: meaning-seeker Mark Davis and witty social observer Milo 
Binder seem the most likely to make a mark, while bands Different World and the 
Beef Sisters could develop into contenders as well. 
</P>
<P>
Among the murky mind-expansion brigade, Jane's Addiction is certainly the most 
prominent, while fellow late-night denizen Caterwaul also seems a good 
candidate for big things, based on the preview EP I.R.S. has just issued. An 
album from the Betsy Martin-fronted quartet is due early this year. The stable 
of psyche-rock purveyors at Nate Starkman &amp; Son records also seems quite 
promising, with Shiva Burlesque, the best of the bunch, reportedly getting some 
major label attention these days. 
</P>
<P>
The best live club act this year was Mary's Danish, which combines the droll 
wit and delivery of singers Julie Ritter and Gretchen Seager with a wild, loose 
funk-rock sound. American Martyrs and the Bel-Fires have also both developed 
strong live presences that seem ripe for big-label vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
The Wild Cards, who released a debut LP "Cool Not Cold," also could (finally) 
be the band to follow fellow Latinos Los Lobos to national attention. And the 
country world offers potential matinee idol Jim Lauderdale (a debut album 
coming soon from Epic), country-rock songstresses Lucinda Williams (a new album 
that more than lives up to her good name around local clubs) and Kimm Rogers.

SOUND &amp; VISION: A LONG SEARCH FOR THE BEST PERFECT VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sound &amp; Vision searched the tube over, channel after channel, in search of 
quality rock video clips that would reflect consenting adults enjoying normal, 
healthy relationships. We found exactly . . . one. To round out most of the 
other nine slots in our 1988 Video Top 10, we had to settle for well-executed 
renditions of the same old song and dance. 
</P>
<P>
The year's best: 
</P>
<P>
1. Joni Mitchell's "My Secret Place" (Director: Anton Corbijn). Perhaps one of 
the few videos ever made to convey such emotional intimacy, "Secret" dramatized 
a fetching Mitchell and glowing duet partner Peter Gabriel quietly bonding over 
dinner (!). Warm, subtle and recognizably human, it naturally received almost 
no airplay. 
</P>
<P>
2. George Harrison's "When We Was Fab" (Godley &amp; Creme). If the "Magical 
Mystery Tour" film had lived up to its potential, it might have had the charm 
of this effects-filled clip, a bit of winsome but hard-edged nostalgia for the 
more psychedelic days of the Fab Four. 
</P>
<P>
3. Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal" (Colin Chilvers). A silly but eminently 
watchable (and rewatchable) 10-minute all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza 
that's a marked return to video form for the Gloved One. The best rhythm track 
off Jackson's "Bad" album is combined with fresh choreography that shows the 
Fred Astaire comparisons may not be so off base after all. 
</P>
<P>
4. Bruce Springsteen's "One Step Up" (Meiert Avis). Though set in a 
working-class bar atmosphere far removed from Springsteen's daily life, this 
tone poem on marital alienation and straying affections held more resonance for 
many curious viewers -- like much of the "Tunnel of Love" album -- in the face 
of subsequent events. 
</P>
<P>
5. Nancy Sinatra's "These Boots Are Made for Walkin"' (Robert Sidney). A 
re-release of a 22-year-old clip, "Boots" demonstrated that -- even with 
then-acceptable cellulite and relatively modest mini-skirts -- Nancy and her 
booted dancing partners could out-fox Lita Ford any day. 
</P>
<P>
6. Roy Orbison's "Oh Pretty Woman" (Tony Mitchell). Excerpted from the 
star-studded cable-TV gala filmed at the Cocoanut Grove. What's that we see? 
He's walkin' back to us . . . in mementos like this video, at least, if -- 
sadly -- no longer in life. 
</P>
<P>
7. Steve Winwood's "Roll With It" (David Finchman). What a wonderful fantasy: A 
night out at a sweaty, sepia-toned, racially integrated bar in which Winwood 
leads the house soul band. 
</P>
<P>
8. LL Cool J's "Goin' Back to Cali" (Ric Menello). A New York rapper's-eye-view 
of a return to L.A. in which all the cliches (palm trees, cruising) somehow 
look fresh. 
</P>
<P>
9. Weird Al Yankovic's "Fat" (Jay Levy). Combine the non-stop obesity jokes on 
the sound track with the non-stop Michael Jackson parody on the screen -- one 
big non sequitur if ever there was one -- and what you get is a tasteless, 
pointlessly hilarious guilty pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
10. Sam Brown's "Stop" (Eric Watson). A blond. A red dress. A soulful voice 
tackling a slow blues ballad. Sometimes life's simplest pleasures are best.

THE BLOSSOMING OF L.A. ARTISTS IN '88.; 
</P>
<P>
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR PRICES FOR 'PRICELESS' PIECES WERE NUMBING, BUT OUT HERE 
THE OUTLOOK IS DOWN-TO-EARTH

<P>
Well, it's over again. Bits of pastel serpentine weave through the carpet and a 
champagne cork is wedged into the potted palm. Time to stare out at the garden 
and ruminate on '88. 
</P>
<P>
It might have gone down as the year when the tainted opulence of Post-Modernism 
was in full flower, the spectacle of an art world where aesthetics are swamped 
by jillionaire collectors flourishing power. 
</P>
<P>
Winter: Armand Hammer announced he would jerk his blue-chip collection away 
from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art where it had been promised repeatedly 
for nearly 20 years. Hammer decided to establish his own private boutique 
museum in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Spring: Negotiations aimed at bringing Norton Simon's fabled collections under 
the stewardship of UCLA guttered out. 
</P>
<P>
Summer: The annual confrontation between the J. Paul Getty Museum and Thomas 
Hoving's Connoisseur magazine arrived with the predictability of the gas bill. 
The Getty bought a rare ancient Greek Aphrodite and Hoving said it had been 
smuggled out of Italy. Something similar had happened the year before. And the 
year before that. 
</P>
<P>
Fall: New York auctions turned into a feeding frenzy that drove prices for 
modern art to stratospheric obscenity. A Jasper Johns brought $17 million. A 
Picasso at $24.75 million, then another in London for $38.5 million. Sales 
totals in the hundreds of millions. 
</P>
<P>
Felt like the Last Days of Pompeii, lavish hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
Remember when great art was called "priceless"? There was something nice about 
that. "Priceless" said it doesn't matter if a work of art sells for $50 or $50 
million, the experience of it is about something else, something delicate, 
numinous and poetic. Hard figures vulgarize the expression like a price tag put 
on the act of love. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been remembered as a year of fascinating naughty titivating 
tattle out of "Life Styles of the Rich and Arrogant" but things happened in Los 
Angeles that evidence significance. A generation of artists who were once art's 
quirky Young Turks came to mature fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
This gratifying harvest was probably best symbolized by a man who is not a 
painter or a sculptor but an architect. Frank Gehry has long been the L.A. art 
world's architect -- openly and deeply influenced by everybody from Billy Al 
Bengston to Robert Irwin. His year began with a traveling retrospective at the 
Museum of Contemporary Art. It was a triumph of exhibition design including 
recreations of copper-clad spiral rooms, a walk-in fish used as an office by 
somebody with Jonah-in-the-whale fantasies, cardboard tables and chairs that 
looked like bats wearing bearskin coats, all wonderfully imaginative and gently 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
The next thing you knew, Gehry was the centerpiece of a New York exhibition 
god-fathered by Philip Johnson. Titled "Deconstructivist Architecture," it 
placed Gehry at the wellspring position among an international group searching 
for ways to revivify the modernist structural vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
By year's end, architectural critics had praised him as the most important 
practitioner in the country. He became a rare prophet in his own land when he 
finally received a commission for a key cultural building, the Disney Pavilion 
at the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
No discouraging word was heard around Gehry's apotheosis. Clearly deserved, it 
was nothing but justice done. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the year was punctuated with echoes of the L.A. aesthetic coming to 
mature ripening. David Hockney's retrospective at LACMA found the transplanted 
Brit intelligent, urbane, witty and curious. This artist, who virtually created 
L.A.'s own hedonistic image of itself -- reflected in the whiplash ripples of 
its pools -- left us a lot to ponder. Hockney -- sometimes seen as a 
lightweight who fritters away his gifts on opera sets and Polaroid montages -- 
can no more be denied the underlying seriousness of his purpose than could Noel 
Coward. 
</P>
<P>
As the months rolled by, the sense of L.A. coming into its own just kept on 
blossoming. There were external events such as the opening of LACMA's pavilion 
for Japanese Art. Housing Joe D. Price's superb collection of Edo period 
painting in an imaginative and apt building by the late Bruce Goff provided a 
curiously exotic harmonic to LACMA's diverse architectural styles. Curator 
Stephanie Barron confirmed her expertise and originality in the exhibition 
"German Expressionism, The Second Generation." 
</P>
<P>
But artists -- L.A. artists -- managed to hold center stage. Bengston's 
retrospective, still on view at LACMA, added itself to Hockney, and a look back 
at Richard Diebenkorn's works on paper headed this way in March from New York. 
There is an unexpected overlap in their work, in its shared tropical pastel 
palette and fundamental concern with timeless questions of drawing and 
composition. They share a degree of calm mastery. 
</P>
<P>
Count in the sculptor Robert Graham, whose LACMA showing of his monument to 
Duke Ellington found him more flexible and more calmly assured than ever. 
</P>
<P>
But it was old Ed Moses who came sidewinding out of the chute like a buckaroo 
on a stoned pony. Paintings seen at L.A. Louver certainly constituted the 
commercial gallery show of the year, with their crazy Pollock-ribbons of paint 
kicking open deep space with all the control of a Frank Stella. If a full-dress 
Moses retrospective is not in the works, there just ain't no justice. 
</P>
<P>
And it was not just The Boys who came up smiling. L.A.'s enduring maverick's 
maverick Joyce Treiman was reviewed in a USC exhibition. Her classic painterly 
realist diary of haunted art fantasies and spiritual insight revealed new 
depths to even her closest observers. 
</P>
<P>
And LACMA tipped our hat to Helen Lundeberg, who was painting around here when 
our ranking patriarchs were still on tricycles. 
</P>
<P>
It left us all knowing that making real art takes a long time. This amazing 
payoff represents at least three decades of artistic ripening. It was all begun 
when things were very focused around here. People who paid attention knew all 
the artists who counted and followed their work in great detail. The people who 
made the work had anybody's normal dreams of recognition and reward, but they 
were going to make their art if it meant two-bit second jobs and a lifetime of 
spaghetti and cheap red wine. 
</P>
<P>
In today's sprawling, overpopulated, fast-buck climate, where good artists cave 
in to making corporate decoration and careers blaze and fizzle like flat-tire 
flares, it's hard to know where a comparable generation is going to come from 
in 2025. Art goes on. That there is still serious purpose out there somewhere 
was well attested by the Anselm Kiefer survey at MOCA. There's always hope, but 
the future has a formidable task of sorting ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Funny how nice stuff manages to happen in a climate where every charge of 
vulgarized art and popularized museums is absolutely true. And yet they keep 
managing to engage us deeply with revelatory revivals, such as LACMA's current 
Guido Reni exhibitions, or with once-in-a-lifetime extravaganzas, such as the 
Metropolitan's Degas exhibition or the pageant of Paul Gauguin at the National 
Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Proves there are still good people out there doing the right thing. Proves that 
no matter how fetid the climate, art is still great stuff.

VENEZUELA WILL DELAY PAYING DEBT PRINCIPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise move, the outgoing president of Venezuela said Saturday that the 
fourth-biggest debtor in Latin America is suspending principal payments on 
nearly all of its $30.3-billion debt to foreign banks. 
</P>
<P>
The move was not as drastic a step as halting interest payments, but it 
highlights a hardening of attitudes among Latin American leaders over the 
worsening economic situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enormous Toll Reflected 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, a leading oil exporter, has been a model debtor nation and was the 
only big Latin American debtor to continue making principal payments through 
the 1980s. But the decision Saturday reflects the enormous toll being taken on 
Latin American countries by huge debt payments to foreign banks. 
</P>
<P>
The debt crisis, which is entering its seventh year, has choked off growth in 
many Latin American economies as earnings are devoted to paying foreign debt 
instead of financing local growth. Latin American leaders have warned that 
declining living standards threaten the region's political stability and its 
fledgling democratic governments. 
</P>
<P>
President-elect George Bush said in December that he will order a major review 
of current U.S. strategy for dealing with Third World debt. He told reporters 
that "we've got enormous problems, particularly in our own hemisphere, with 
Third World debt." 
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide television address announcing the Venezuelan suspension of 
payments, President Jaime Lusinchi said, "The problem of foreign debt today 
strangles the economic and social development of the great majority of the 
world's peoples." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Revenue Slump 
</P>
<P>
He said he had ordered the suspension, effective Jan. 17, because of the slump 
in revenue from oil exports and what he said were high interest rates on the 
debt. Lusinchi said that Venezuelan officials plan to meet soon with their 
leading creditor banks to negotiate new terms on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. banker familiar with Venezuela's position said the country wants to 
reduce its loan payments by stretching out the terms of its existing loans. 
</P>
<P>
Between 35% and 40% of the $30.3 billion is owed to U.S. banks. Chase Manhattan 
Bank in New York is Venezuela's leading U.S. lender. San Francisco-based Bank 
of America is the second-largest creditor, with $1.1 billion in long-term and 
medium-term loans. 
</P>
<P>
Donald K. Crowley, a banking industry analyst in the San Francisco office of 
the investment firm of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said the suspension's 
impact on U.S. banks would be minimal because none is overexposed in Venezuela. 
But he said the Venezuelan action came as a shock and would be significant if 
it represented a move among Latin American nations to adopt a common approach 
to dealing with foreign creditors, which would give them more bargaining 
leverage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colombia's Suspension 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Colombia said for the first time that it was suspending payment on 
its $16.5-billion foreign debt for three months until a new $1.7-billion 
international loan is received. 
</P>
<P>
Louis G. Schirano, an executive in the New York offices of Los Angeles-based 
First Interstate Bancorp., said he did not interpret the Venezuelan move as a 
major setback. He said that Venezuela, which will continue paying interest on 
its debt, has simply joined the other Latin debtors in suspending its principal 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
"What banks really care about is the debt service (interest) and that will 
still be flowing," said Schirano, whose bank has divested itself of all 
Venezuelan debt. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America's largest debtor nations are Brazil, $113 billion; Mexico, $108 
billion; and Argentina, $54 billion. Unlike Venezuela, all three have halted 
interest payments to foreign banks at various times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debt Action Urged 
</P>
<P>
The presidents of all four nations, along with three other Latin American 
countries, have urged the United States to make the debt problem a major 
political priority. Bush's remarks about reviewing U.S. efforts have been 
interpreted in some quarters as a move to possibly forgive some portion of the 
huge debt owed to private banks by Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
The previous U.S. strategy for dealing with the problem, the so-called Baker 
Plan, was designed in 1985 by then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who 
will be Bush's secretary of state. He called for commercial banks and the World 
Bank to provide new loans in return for growth-oriented economic changes in the 
debtor nations. 
</P>
<P>
But new lending has been rare. The 17 countries that are most deeply in debt 
owe $529 billion and paid $14 billion more to creditors than they received in 
new loans in 1987, the latest year for which figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
A U.N. development organization said in September that commercial banks should 
forgive at least 30% of the amount owed by the 15 most heavily indebted Third 
World countries. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said that was the 
only way of giving the nations the opportunity to retain enough capital to grow 
faster and repay the remainder of the debt. 
</P>
<P>
While Venezuela's economy is in better shape than that of most of the other 
debtors, the sharp two-year decline in oil prices has caused problems. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the government raised tariffs sharply to restrain imports and 
conserve its cash reserves. Tariffs were increased as much as 160% on about 500 
consumer items, ranging from electronics to liquor.

U.S.-CHINA STRAINS SURFACE; BASIS OF RELATIONSHIP SHIFTS

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the time, Republican presidential contender Ronald Reagan called it "a 
shabby, needless blow." His intra-party rival, George Bush, branded it "an 
abject American retreat." And then-Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) termed it 
"unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such criticism, 10 years ago today, on Jan. 1, 1979, the Jimmy Carter 
Administration broke formal U.S. ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic 
relations with the People's Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
"We are recognizing a simple reality," President Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
But, as a matter of American foreign policy, it had been anything but simple. 
For nearly three decades, the United States had refused to recognize the 
Communist regime in Beijing and had pretended that the Chinese Nationalists on 
Taiwan were the government for all of China. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 10 years later, the entire relationship between the United States and 
China has changed. New assumptions govern the behavior of both nations, and 
U.S. scholars predict that in the next few years the two governments may find 
themselves in increasing conflict with one another on a number of foreign 
policy questions, such as the Middle East and Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that China and the United States won't be as close as they were 
before," said Thomas W. Robinson of the American Enterprise Institute. "There 
has to be a certain distancing on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, during the last decade the U.S. recognition of Beijing -- and 
its avoidance of official dealings with Taiwan -- has become an established, 
accepted fact in American domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan, once one of Taiwan's closest friends in American politics, 
honored the U.S. recognition of Beijing last month by saying he is confident 
that the United States and China will "forge even stronger ties and build a 
safer, more prosperous world." Taiwan, meanwhile, has managed to survive and 
prosper despite its diplomatic isolation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Longer in Tandem 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the United States and China no longer operate in close 
tandem with one another in international affairs in the way that they did a 
decade ago. The common bond of shared opposition to the Soviet Union has frayed 
as the United States and China separately seek warmer ties with the government 
of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an increasing sense that the era in which the bilateral relationship 
(between the United States and China) was based importantly on opposition to 
Moscow has ended," University of Washington Prof. Nicholas R. Lardy wrote 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two years the United States and China have been at odds over a 
number of issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chinese Arms Sales an Issue 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials voiced bitter complaints about China's arms sales to the Middle 
East, including the sale of Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran and 
intermediate-range ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia. China took umbrage at 
U.S. congressional resolutions denouncing China's policies on human rights and 
in Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
As if to symbolize the current atmosphere of mistrust, China recently imposed 
new travel restrictions on American diplomats working at consulates in the 
Chinese cities of Shenyang and Shanghai. The United States called these curbs 
"unreasonable" and countered by slapping new limits on personnel at the Chinese 
Consulate in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of reciprocal nastiness would have been unthinkable 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, the United States and China did not even have any diplomats 
living and working in the heartland of each other's territory. Second, both 
nations were eager to set aside all sources of conflict at the time to work 
together against the perceived Soviet threat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted Strategic Partner 
</P>
<P>
"The United States didn't have too much choice," said one West European 
diplomat who follows Chinese affairs. "China was looking for a strategic 
partner against the Soviet Union. It found two countries who were willing to 
play the game: Japan and the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Although President Richard M. Nixon had moved to normalize ties with Beijing 
during his historic 1972 visit to China, neither he nor his successor, 
President Gerald R. Ford, was able to establish diplomatic relations with the 
Communist regime. They were never able to overcome the strong support for 
Taiwan's Nationalist regime in the right wing of the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, the time then-Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) resorted to 
strong-arm tactics against Ford and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
One day in May, 1976, Goldwater sent a private ultimatum to the Ford White 
House. He said he had heard a radio report that the Ford Administration was 
planning to establish diplomatic relations with "Red China," either before or 
after the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Intend to Stay Quiet' 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any sense to me to forgo our friends on Taiwan and I don't 
intend to stay quiet about it, so please within 24 hours let me know what the 
truth is, and I mean the truth," Goldwater wrote. He threatened to withdraw 
political support for Ford, who was then being challenged by Reagan for the 
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
According to files at the Gerald R. Ford presidential library, Ford and 
Kissinger were forced to cave in. Within a day, Kissinger called Goldwater and 
gave him the assurances that were necessary to avoid a public dispute. 
</P>
<P>
It was left to Carter, a Democratic President, to take the political heat of 
recognizing China, and he, too, delayed doing so until soon after the 1978 
congressional elections. When Carter finally made the public announcement, on 
Dec. 15, 1978, he was immediately savaged by conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Within a month, Reagan was not only criticizing Carter's recognition of 
Beijing, but also advocating "continuation of government-to-government 
relations between the United States and Taiwan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reagan Brought Testy Period 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's arrival in the White House precipitated a testy period in which China 
was unsure how much support the new President would give to Taiwan. The tension 
eased with a 1982 agreement limiting U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and, ultimately, 
with Reagan's own election-year visit to China in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
During that trip, the President minimized the ideological differences with 
China that had once preoccupied American conservatives by referring to China as 
a "so-called Communist country." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, the United States and China began to set aside -- or perhaps 
postpone for the future -- their disputes over Taiwan. The two countries even 
began to collaborate on a series of military exchanges, with Pentagon officials 
making regular visits to China and leaders of the Chinese People's Liberation 
Army touring military installations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But the two sides began to fight over other issues. China, sensitive to charges 
by Third World countries that it was aligning itself too closely with the 
United States, announced that it was conducting an "independent" foreign 
policy. The United States began to complain about China's arms sales overseas 
and to worry about China's continuing support for the murderous Khmer Rouge in 
Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade and Students 
</P>
<P>
Whenever the two sides bicker, U.S. officials explain that ties with China 
remain strong. They point to the increasing trade between the two countries -- 
more than $13 billion this year -- and the high number of Chinese students, an 
estimated 32,000 to 40,000, being educated at American universities. 
</P>
<P>
One senior Reagan Administration official said last year that China and the 
United States now have a "mature" relationship, suggesting that the two 
countries are like a married couple, able to withstand a good fight once in a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
Some American scholars found such bland explanations irritating. "If I hear one 
more State Department official talk about a 'mature relationship' with China, 
I'm going to scream," said Robinson. "It's as if the Chinese were juveniles 
before now." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although U.S. officials have gone to great lengths to stress the calm 
and continuity in Sino-American relations, the underlying American attitudes 
toward China have been changing in some significant ways during the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deng Toured U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, U.S. officials pinned their hopes for China's future largely on 
China's top political leadership. Within weeks after diplomatic relations were 
established in 1979, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made a triumphal tour of the 
United States. U.S. officials were effusive in their praise of Deng and the 
reform program he was beginning to launch in China. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Deng is 84, and some American officials and scholars have suggested 
privately that he is becoming arbitrary and erratic in his leadership, in much 
the same way as did Mao Tse-tung in the final years before his death in 1976. 
Last spring, for example, Deng seemed to call for a lifting of price controls 
and then to pull back in the face of a spurt of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are also critical of some of the Chinese leaders who may succeed 
Deng. Speaking of Chinese Premier Li Peng, who was trained and educated in the 
Soviet Union, one Reagan Administration official said recently: "Li Peng just 
doesn't understand how a market economy works. Things won't really move in 
China until after his years in power." 
</P>
<P>
These days, American hopes for China seem to rest not on its political elite, 
but on broader, long-range developments in Chinese society -- particularly the 
tens of thousands of young students being educated in the United States and the 
market-oriented economic reforms that are taking hold in China at the 
grass-roots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Divided Over Policy 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there appear to be serious divisions among American 
policy-makers and scholars about how the United States should approach China in 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Some American experts say that the United States should now base its ties to 
China primarily on economic cooperation and shift focus away from strategic 
factors such as joint opposition to the Soviet Union. "The relationship (with 
China) from the beginning has been premised far too much on anti-Soviet 
factors," Lardy said. 
</P>
<P>
But one Reagan Administration official, who said that he personally agrees with 
this argument, acknowledged: "There are still people in senior policy ranks in 
the United States who view China strictly in strategic terms." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech in San Francisco, U.S. Ambassador to China Winston Lord 
declared: "Contrary to some fashionable pundits, I strongly believe strategic 
factors will remain crucial to our cooperation with China. . . . They are more 
muted and nuanced than before. But our two nations share a continuing stake in 
preserving global and regional balances." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, at the time they established diplomatic relations, the United 
States and China were drawn together by their eagerness to join hands against 
the Soviet Union. Now, American scholars say, nothing between China and the 
United States is quite so easy. 
</P>
<P>
"If people want a clear, compelling basis for U.S.-China relations these days, 
there just isn't going to be one," Harry Harding of the Brookings Institution 
said. "Except that we are two big countries that are going to have to live with 
one another."

GORBACHEV CALLS FOR 'GUMPTION' IN REFORM PUSH 
</P>

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a televised New Year's address 
Saturday, called on the Soviet people to stop sitting on the sidelines and to 
show greater "gumption" in pursuing his policy of economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev acknowledged that perestroika, his program to restructure Soviet 
society, had raised high hopes among the citizens that had not yet been met. 
The 57-year-old Kremlin leader, who took office in March of 1985, blamed 
conservative forces in part for the slow pace of reform. 
</P>
<P>
But, using tough language, he also said that every Soviet citizen should do 
more to improve the quality of consumer goods and to end the shortages that 
have typified Soviet life since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Greater Resoluteness' 
</P>
<P>
"One cannot just outwit life and sit back on the sidelines," Gorbachev said. 
"It is essential to act with greater resoluteness." 
</P>
<P>
He said his attempt to revamp Soviet society "lends wings to real champions . . 
. and gives them added energies and gumption. And this is just what we need now 
most of all." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks seem to respond to critics who complained bitterly to him during a 
trip to Siberia in September of long -- and often unsuccessful -- waits to 
obtain basic consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Those dramatic encounters were carried on Soviet television, and Western 
analysts said the complaints helped to push Gorbachev to make major 
governmental changes in October, putting reform-minded supporters in positions 
of power. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's year-end speech was broadcast across the country on Soviet 
television just minutes before midnight and was probably widely seen. New 
Year's Eve in the Soviet Union is a family holiday that traditionally includes 
the exchange of gifts and the viewing of special television programs until 
early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not want, and have no right, to paint a rosy overall picture," the 
Communist Party leader said in the broadcast. "Perestroika gave rise to great 
expectations to society, but changes are not coming as fast as we would all 
like them to . . . . Demand still outstrips supply, especially when it comes to 
quality goods. 
</P>
<P>
"This," he added, "is explained in a large measure not only by the inertia of 
the past but also by the novelty of problems and the real difficulties of 
organizing life in a new way." 
</P>
<P>
Letters to officials have revealed Soviet concerns about how perestroika would 
affect individuals in the society where everyone is guaranteed a job and the 
state subsidizes everything from bread to apartments. 
</P>
<P>
In his address, Gorbachev warned that perestroika would mean greater individual 
responsibility. He said the changes would include more reliance on "the 
pay-your-own-way system . . . and a broadened scope for initiatives and social 
enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Have to Get in the Mood' 
</P>
<P>
"We all have to get into the mood for such work," he added. 
</P>
<P>
On the topic of international relations, Gorbachev claimed that the Soviet 
Union, acting "in the spirit of the new political thinking," was largely 
responsible for the thaw in the Cold War between East and West. The Soviets 
have learned to listen to the positions of other countries while still "abiding 
by our own principles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the shadows of the past are present in world politics," the Soviet 
leader added. "But they are fading already. A new vision of the world is being 
established." 
</P>
<P>
On other subjects, Gorbachev referred briefly to the nationalist unrest that 
has torn parts of the Soviet Union. At least 31 people were killed in November 
in ethnic violence in the southwestern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are proceeding to another important phase of political reform, which will 
aim to harmonize inter-ethnic relations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also spoke of the Dec. 7 earthquake in Armenia, which the Soviet Union has 
said claimed tens of thousands of lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The end of the year was darkened by anguish," he said. "Our misfortune has 
evoked warmth, sympathy and response around the world."

GORBACHEV AND REAGAN EXCHANGE HOLIDAY GREETINGS

<P>
For the second consecutive year, President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev exchanged New Year's greetings for the Soviet and American people, 
each saluting the sharp improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange of videotaped messages, each about five minutes long, for 
broadcast on Soviet and American television, reflected the new ease with which 
Reagan, who took office as perhaps the most anti-Communist leader in recent 
U.S. history, has been dealing with the Soviet Union in general and Gorbachev 
in particular. 
</P>
<P>
As if recognizing this, Gorbachev said in his remarks -- a text of which was 
made public Saturday by the White House -- that "Americans seem to be 
rediscovering the Soviet Union -- and we are rediscovering America. Fears and 
suspicion are gradually giving way to trust and feelings of mutual liking. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was rich in momentous events. It also brought many good changes in 
relations between our peoples and countries," the Soviet leader added. "Today 
they are more dynamic and more humane. We have become closer, and we have come 
to know each other better." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Reagan told the Soviet people, "I am confident that relations 
between our two countries will continue on the positive course they have 
followed in the year just ending. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite our disagreements, we have been able to find some common ground," he 
added, singling out human rights, arms control, regional problems and 
U.S.-Soviet relations in general. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan-Gorbachev exchange was broadcast in full by ABC and NBC. CBS used 
excerpts from both talks on its evening news program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difference From Last Year 
</P>
<P>
In tone and specific content, the speeches by the two leaders reflected the 
positive course in relations, when compared with the addresses each delivered 
one year ago. At that time, Reagan used the Soviet airwaves to gently prod the 
Kremlin on such sensitive issues as human rights and regional disputes, while 
giving a condensed introduction to American society that offered the Soviet 
audience a glimpse of American holiday traditions and a miniature civics 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
And two years ago, Gorbachev declared that after the failures of the October, 
1986, summit conference in Iceland, superpower relations were too poor to 
justify an exchange of New Year's greetings. So, Reagan's message that year, 
broadcast on the Voice of America, was blotted out by electronic jamming in 
much of the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's 1989 message was videotaped on Dec. 15 in the White House Map Room, 
before the President flew to California for a two-week vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The President said that in human rights, "progress is being made in 
reunification of families, freedom of people to travel as they please, and in 
other areas." He also said that the halt in electronic jamming is a positive 
step. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Solutions Being Found' 
</P>
<P>
"In regional issues, from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf and southern Africa, 
solutions are being found to conflicts of many years' standing," Reagan said, 
challenging the Soviets to join "in the effort to bring peace, democracy and 
security to Central America" -- a region to which Gorbachev made no reference 
in his speech. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan also challenged the Soviets to go beyond the 500,000-troop cut in 
conventional forces that Gorbachev announced at the United Nations on Dec. 7. 
The troop reduction, Reagan said, is "certainly a step in the right direction 
of correcting the imbalances in the European military situation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Administration Change 
</P>
<P>
Both the American and Soviet presidents, recognizing the change in 
administrations that is about to occur in the United States, predicted that 
President-elect George Bush would bring an element of continuity to the two 
nations' relations. 
</P>
<P>
"We can look ahead with optimism to the future of our relations. This is what 
we talked about with President-elect Bush," Gorbachev said, referring to his 
meeting with Bush in New York on the day of the U.N. speech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Optimistic Approach 
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address broadcast in the United States, Reagan took a 
slightly less optimistic approach, stating that U.S.-Soviet relations can 
continue to improve, but "we must remain sober in our estimation of our 
negotiating partners and without illusion . . . about their goals and aims." 
</P>
<P>
Whether seeking reduced tensions in relations with the Soviet Union or in the 
Middle East, the Bush Administration will need congressional support and 
"appropriate levels of defense spending," Reagan said, adding, "Trust me, I 
know." 
</P>
<P>
The radio address was delivered from the Palms Spring estate of Walter and 
Leonore Annenberg, with whom the President and Nancy Reagan are spending the 
New Year's holiday, as they have for nearly two decades. The festivities 
included a black-tie New Year's Eve dinner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Policy of Peace Paying Off' 
</P>
<P>
As the New Year arrived, the President declared in the radio speech that "our 
economy is healthy, our defenses are strong and our policy of peace through 
strength is paying off in spades." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's optimism was tempered only by the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 on Dec. 
21. 
</P>
<P>
"Now if, as seems likely, our terrorists have crawled out of their hole to 
threaten American lives, I can promise them this: The pledge we made to seek 
out the truth and punish the guilty is a sacred one which George Bush shares," 
he said.

STATE HIGH COURT TAKES ANTICIPATED TURN TO THE RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The widely anticipated turn to the right by the newly aligned California 
Supreme Court emerged in strikingly clear form in a range of decisions issued 
during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, under a liberal majority led by former Chief Justice Rose 
Elizabeth Bird, business, insurers and law enforcement repeatedly suffered 
defeat. But last year, under a more conservative court led by Chief Justice 
Malcolm M. Lucas, yesterday's losers became today's consistent winners. 
</P>
<P>
The trend was underscored last week in the court's long-awaited ruling on 
wrongful discharge in which the justices limited the rights of workers to sue 
their employers for an unjust dismissal -- a decision with sweeping impact on a 
fast-growing area of employment law. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling followed the justices' far-reaching reversal last August of a 1979 
landmark ruling that had allowed accident victims to bring damage suits against 
the wrongdoer's insurance company for the bad-faith refusal to accept a claim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uphold Death Sentences 
</P>
<P>
On another front, the court, struggling to reduce a huge backlog of death 
penalty appeals, issued 56 capital rulings in 12 months, upholding death 
sentences 43 times. 
</P>
<P>
In the nine years ending in January, 1987, with the departure of Bird and two 
other justices defeated in the 1986 fall election, the court affirmed the death 
penalty only four times in 68 rulings. 
</P>
<P>
In other notable criminal law decisions last year, the court abandoned a past 
ruling that had restricted the use of improperly obtained confessions, opened 
the way for longer prison terms for repeat offenders and upheld a law aimed at 
curbing sex offenses by prohibiting loitering at public restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year, the justices showed little inclination to seek societal 
reform through ground-breaking court decisions -- a trademark of the court for 
the nearly three decades that it was under a liberal majority. The new court 
looked for guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court and courts in other states and 
expressed a desire to leave it to the Legislature to make bold changes in state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critics Disturbed 
</P>
<P>
The court's sharp turn disturbs critics who, while expecting some shift toward 
judicial conservatism, had hoped the change would not be so abrupt and 
wide-ranging. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Lucas court has taken over, we have had a series of decisions which 
operate to deprive individuals of their economic rights while benefiting large 
corporate institutions," said Steven J. Kaplan, a Los Angeles attorney who 
represented the employee who brought the wrongful-dismissal case decided last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"This court, at a visceral level, is much more sympathetic to the corporate 
world than its predecessor," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Laurence, director of a newly formed Death Penalty Project of the 
American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, raises concern over the 
record pace of capital case rulings and the court's tendency to uphold death 
verdicts even though a procedural error has occurred at trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised that the court is not taking a closer look at some of these 
cases," Laurence said. "This court is much more willing to find an error was 
harmless than was the previous court." 
</P>
<P>
But the beneficiaries of the shift on the court welcome what they see as a more 
balanced approach and a greater effort to clarify the law for judges, lawyers 
and litigants. 
</P>
<P>
"This court has a fuller appreciation of what's involved in a criminal 
prosecution and a real-life grasp of how a case moves through the judicial 
system," said state Chief Assistant Atty. Gen. Steve White. 
</P>
<P>
"In both the criminal and civil area of the law, the court is more inclined to 
be sensible about the impact of a ruling on the judicial process," White said. 
"It seems much more interested in supplying guidance to all parties so we can 
avoid error where possible." 
</P>
<P>
In an ironic twist, the court issued several rulings in 1988 that went against 
Gov. George Deukmejian, a leading critic of the Bird court who named the five 
justices to the seven-member court who formed a bloc that set a new 
philosophical course in the law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taken by Surprise 
</P>
<P>
This apparent assertion of independence from the influence by the Republican 
governor took some observers by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The justices ruled that Deukmejian's nominee for state treasurer, Rep. Daniel 
E. Lungren, could not take office with confirmation by only one house of the 
Legislature; held that a commission made up of Deukmejian appointees could not 
establish a "sub-minimum" wage for employees receiving tips, and twice refused 
to hear a Deukmejian Administration challenge to a 1981 Bird court ruling that 
struck down legislative restrictions on state-funded abortions for low-income 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the results in a broad range of decisions issued during the last 
year signaled a marked change in direction from the old court. 
</P>
<P>
In significant criminal law rulings, the court: 
</P>
<P>
* Upheld three of every four death penalty verdicts it reviewed and, while 
issuing no particularly far-reaching decisions, made clear that it will not 
overturn death sentences because of a procedural error that, realistically, 
could not have affected the outcome of the case. 
</P>
<P>
* Ruled that prosecutors may use improperly obtained confessions to challenge 
the truthfulness of a defendant's testimony at trial. The justices, abandoning 
a 1976 ruling barring any such use of incriminating statements, said that under 
Proposition 8, the 1982 victims' bill-of-rights initiative, state courts now 
are bound by less-restrictive U.S. Supreme Court decisions on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
* Reversed a 1986 ruling by the old court and held that trial judges may review 
a wider range of court records to determine whether convicted felons may be 
sentenced to longer prison terms because of previous commission of a 
residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
* Held that the state Board of Prison Terms properly rescinded the impending 
parole of "Onion Field" killer Gregory Ulas Powell based on new evidence that 
his release could endanger public safety. The decision overturned a contrary 
ruling by the Bird court in 1986 that had opened the way for the release of the 
convicted murderer of a Los Angeles police officer in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
* Reversing another decision under Bird, held that trial judges need not warn 
jurors that eyewitness identifications of suspected criminals may be unreliable 
and should be viewed with caution. The debate over the reliability of such 
identifications should be left to trial counsel and expert witnesses to argue 
before the jury, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
* Upheld the constitutionality of a state law making it a crime to loiter near 
a public restroom. The court rejected arguments by civil libertarians that the 
law would encourage discriminatory arrests against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
* Allowed the prosecution for manslaughter of a Christian Scientist parent 
whose child died after her mother rejected medical assistance in favor of an 
attempt to heal by prayer. Parents, the court said, have no right to exercise 
religious beliefs at the price of a child's life. 
</P>
<P>
In major civil decisions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
* Ruling in the milestone case of Los Angeles executive Daniel D. Foley, held 
that an employee who is fired without good cause, in violation of a company 
promise, can sue his employer only for lost pay and other economic loss. 
</P>
<P>
Awards for emotional distress and punitive damages, which could range into 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, may not be obtained, the justices said. More 
than 1,000 wrongful discharge suits are filed annually in the state. Attorneys 
predicted a sharp drop in such litigation because dismissed workers will have 
less incentive to file suit and attorneys, working on a contingency-fee basis, 
will be less willing to take on cases. 
</P>
<P>
* Overturned a major ruling by the Bird court and held that accident victims 
may not bring suit under state insurance law for the insurer's refusal to 
fairly settle a claim. The court noted that the previous ruling had been widely 
criticized and rejected by most other states that had considered it. In 
California, the justices said, the ruling had produced confusion, inequitable 
results and high litigation costs. 
</P>
<P>
* Turned down a challenge by state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to the 
$10.1-billion purchase of Getty Oil by Texaco in 1984, ruling that state 
antitrust law cannot be used to attack mergers by corporations. 
</P>
<P>
* Upheld the constitutionality of Proposition 51, the "deep-pockets" 
liability-reform initiative limiting damages for pain and suffering and other 
non-economic injury in civil injury cases. However, the court, limiting the 
immediate impact of the measure, ruled it will not apply to tens of thousands 
of cases that were pending when it was passed by the voters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
* Gave broad protection to prescription drug makers by holding that injured 
consumers cannot collect damages unless they prove that firms were negligent in 
making the drugs or in failing to warn of their potential dangers. In another 
victory for manufacturers, the court also held that cancer victims are not 
entitled to damages for injury from the drug DES unless they filed suit within 
a year after they first suspected harm from the substance. 
</P>
<P>
* In a case watched closely by religious groups, ruled in a milestone "clergy 
malpractice" suit that church pastors may not be held liable for the suicide of 
a despondent youth to whom they had given spiritual counseling. 
</P>
<P>
* Said that the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church can be sued for fraud 
for allegedly "brainwashing" unknowing recruits and tricking them into joining 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
* Barred a single man from suing for the negligence-related death of his 
live-in girlfriend, ruling that unmarried cohabitants are not entitled to the 
same rights that the law gives married couples to bring such suits.

"It's over," said Howard Kleinberg, the News' editor and an employee for 38 
years. "I think we gave it a good effort." 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't just another newspaper dying. It has a rich and proud history," 
Publisher David Kraslow said. "Our influence far exceeded our circulation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Circulation Declines 
</P>
<P>
The circulation of the crusading newspaper, winner of five Pulitzer Prizes, had 
declined 57% in a little more than two decades to about 48,000. The owner, Cox 
Enterprises Inc. of Atlanta, said it was unable to sell the News and was losing 
about $28,500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has said its antitrust division will look at the closing 
and whether Cox made a serious effort to sell the newspaper. But a federal 
judge Friday denied a private coalition's effort to get an injunction against 
the closing. 
</P>
<P>
The only apparent way to give the News a reprieve would be a Justice Department 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
Cox announced in October that the newspaper would be closed Dec. 31 if it was 
not sold. Under a recent amendment to a 1966 joint operating agreement with the 
Miami Herald, Cox would have become responsible in 1990 for the News' operating 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
But Cox will continue to share in profits of the Herald, a Knight-Ridder 
newspaper with a circulation of more than 400,000, through 2021 even with the 
News closed. Cox will earn an estimated $300 million through the agreement, the 
News reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affects News Staff 
</P>
<P>
The news staff, which numbered about 105 in recent weeks, is the main staff 
affected by the shutdown, since the business operation is shared with the 
Herald's. 
</P>
<P>
The News was born May 15, 1896, two months before the city was incorporated, as 
the Miami Metropolis. It lost some readers in the 1960s with its early, 
vigorous criticism of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Even with its employees job-hunting, the News broke several stories in its 
final days and was in the lead in reporting the Justice Department 
investigation and criticism of its own parent company. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a damn good newspaper," said columnist Mort Lucoff, 59, cleaning out 
his desk after 25 years at the newspaper. "It's pretty wrenching. I put a 
quarter-century of life into this newspaper."

BOMB BLAST KILLS 4 AT U.S. HOME OF BRAZILIAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL

A bomb exploded in the garage of a Brazilian Embassy lawyer early Saturday, 
killing her son and three friends who apparently were tinkering with the 
device, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The blast, which occurred at about 3:10 a.m., blew doors and windows out of the 
garage and hurled one of the youths into the driveway of the home rented by 
Vera Machado, the legal counselor for the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
They said Machado and her husband, Ronald, were asleep in an upstairs bedroom 
at the time of the blast and were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
One of the dead youths was identified as Gustavo Machado, 15, the couple's son. 
The others were identified as Samir Gafsi, Dov Fischman and Bruno Perrone, all 
either 17 or 18 years old and all college freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
The three older teen-agers were described Saturday as highly intelligent, 
science-oriented 1988 graduates of Bethesda's Walt Whitman High School. One of 
them, Gafsi, showed a recent interest in explosives, according to his 
girlfriend, Sharmi Banik. 
</P>
<P>
"He was telling me about the explosion on the Pan Am jet" that crashed in 
Scotland on Dec. 21 after a bomb went off, Banik said Saturday. She said Gafsi 
recently told her that he and his friends could "do better than that." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery County Police Sgt. Harry Geehreng said the blast was not caused by 
terrorists and appeared to be an accident. He said there was no indication the 
victims had been drinking or using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
He said the explosion damaged a car in the garage but there was no evidence 
that a bomb had been placed in or under the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is investigating the 
explosion, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials want to know how the device was made as well as "why was the device 
made," Geehreng said. "This device was much more than ordinary fireworks."

A controversial treaty intended to eliminate all trade tariffs between the 
United States and Canada over the next 10 years goes into effect today with the 
exchange of diplomatic notes implementing the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan instructed Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Saturday to 
dispatch the message putting the treaty into effect, the White House announced 
here, where Reagan is spending the New Year's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Reagan spoke by 
telephone Saturday morning with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, 
telling him, "Together, our governments have set an example for the world on 
how eliminating trade barriers can benefit all peoples." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. legislation approving the treaty was signed into law Sept. 28. The final 
Canadian action needed to implement the treaty was taken Friday by the Canadian 
Senate.

HIGH COURT SPOILED BID TO SOLVE BISHOP'S MURDER, SALVADORANS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials in the Salvadoran government say that the 1980 assassination of 
Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, which helped spark the nation's civil war and 
caused worldwide outrage, will remain unresolved because of a Supreme Court 
ruling that the testimony of a key witness is not valid. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, handed down Dec. 21, has caused an uproar in El Salvador, 
escalating the already heated presidential campaign rhetoric between the 
Christian Democrats of President Jose Napoleon Duarte and the rightist 
Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), the main opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the case is now closed and justice has been mocked," said Roberto 
Giron Flores, who, as attorney general, was investigating the case until he was 
fired Dec. 23 by the Arena-controlled National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, who invested much time and effort in the case, were outraged by 
the ruling and are making that displeasure known, but diplomatic and political 
sources say the Americans acknowledge that nothing can be done to revive the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Romero, a charismatic, outspoken opponent of rightist death squads and military 
repression, was killed by a single shot through the heart on March 24, 1980, 
while saying Mass. It was the most publicized killing of thousands carried out 
by the death squads, and Duarte had vowed to punish those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Ambassador Robert E. White asserted that the killing was ordered by 
Roberto d'Aubuisson, a founder of Arena and currently a legislator in the 
National Assembly. D'Aubuisson has denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, Duarte made public testimony given to investigators by Amado 
Garay, identified as the driver of the getaway car in the killing. Garay said 
that he worked for Alvaro Saravia, a cashiered Salvadoran air force captain and 
protege of D'Aubuisson. Garay said that after the killing, Saravia reported on 
the success of the operation to D'Aubuisson. 
</P>
<P>
D'Aubuisson declared at the time that Garay was lying and rejected the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Garay's testimony, after he passed numerous lie-detector tests and 
other elements of his testimony were investigated, the Salvadoran government, 
with U.S. help, asked for Saravia's extradition from Miami, where he was living 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Saravia was arrested in Miami for violating the terms of his visa, and has been 
held since, as the extradition request proceeded. He was to have been 
extradited in early January, according to legal sources. 
</P>
<P>
But the Salvadoran Supreme Court, described by knowledgeable diplomats and 
Christian Democrats as dominated by the far right, ruled Dec. 21 that there 
were no grounds for arresting Saravia if he returned to El Salvador and that 
the extradition request itself was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that delay in presentation of Garay's evidence, after "seven 
years, seven months and 24 days, completely undermines the credibility of his 
testimony" and resulted in no evidence linking Saravia to the killing. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem here is that we have to understand the judicial system has been 
totally dominated by Arena, which blocks the investigation and application of 
justice," said Antonio Morales Erlich, secretary general of the Christian 
Democrats. "I want to say as a lawyer that the witness and evidence presented 
in the Romero case were ample to proceed with an arrest order." 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 23, the assembly, in its last session of the year and with only the 
Arena deputies supporting the move, fired Giron Flores as attorney general, 
alleging "incompetence and immorality," and named Arena sympathizer Roberto 
Garcia Alvarado to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that I was fired for a simple and fundamental reason -- because 
the Romero case was about to be resolved," Giron Flores said. "Saravia was 
about to return and we were going to discover who was responsible. . . . The 
Romero case is now closed, and I was fired so the case could be closed." 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable observers say that Giron Flores is correct, because, by ruling 
that the testimony was too old -- although no Salvadoran law places time limits 
on the validity of testimony -- any new evidence or testimony will be thrown 
out on the same grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"On legal and procedural grounds, the case is dead," said one person familiar 
with the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, after a Mass on 
Christmas Day, said, "In the church, we think (Saravia) has valuable 
information on this act which convulsed the country." 
</P>
<P>
Arena's presidential candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, said that Giron Flores was 
fired for "demonstrable reasons showing he was not fit to continue in office," 
and Cristiani accused the Christian Democrats of throwing up a "smoke screen" 
and "politicizing" the matter by trying to link the firing to the Romero case. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation into Romero's killing was being handled by a special 
investigative unit that had received U.S. training. According to two people 
involved in the investigation, Saravia was also to be charged upon his return 
here with the kidnaping and murder in 1985 of Carlos Guerra Campos, a wealthy 
coffee grower. Investigators said that they planned to use the Guerra Campos 
case to force Saravia to give evidence in the Romero case. 
</P>
<P>
"It was to be our checkmate move," one investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also said that Garay had identified Dr. Hector Antonio Regalado, 
a dentist, as the triggerman in the murder, although they said that there was 
no hard evidence other than Garay's statement linking him to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Regalado, an expert marksman, was head of security at the Constituent Assembly 
when D'Aubuisson was president of that body in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, two men who worked in the assembly at that time said that 
Regalado ran right-wing death squads from the building.

KHOMEINI REINS IN A HIGH-RANKING COUNCIL

<P>
The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Saturday stripped some powers from a 
high-ranking council established in February to speed up Iran's decision-making 
process, Tehran Radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
Following criticism from parliamentary deputies and other radicals that 
formation of the 13-member High Council of Expedience was unconstitutional, 
Khomeini declared that it will no longer be allowed to legislate independently 
of the Majlis, or Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The official radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini, Iran's supreme leader, 
urged a return to constitutional law now that the need for a speedy 
decision-making process has decreased since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war 
with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini, who set up the council in February, said it should revert to its 
original role -- settling disputes between Parliament and the Council of 
Guardians, a panel of clergyman empowered to block laws they consider 
un-Islamic. 
</P>
<P>
"No problem is (now) so urgent as to be debated directly in that council 
without being debated in the Majlis and being supervised by the Council of 
Guardians," Tehran Radio quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The new decree takes effect Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The High Council of Expedience was founded to stop ideological arguments about 
the limits of government power from blocking important legislation. It was also 
authorized to issue decrees on urgent matters.

The youth leader of the main Sikh political party in Punjab was shot to death 
Saturday in an ambush by suspected Sikh extremists, police said.

Malkiat Singh, president of the youth wing of the Unified Akali Dal, was 
attacked as he drove toward Ludhiana, a central Punjab town that has been a 
focus of separatist violence.

Punjab Gov. Siddhartha Shankar Ray issued figures showing the 1988 death toll 
in a violent Sikh campaign for a separate homeland in Punjab was more than 50% 
higher than in 1987 and four times the 1986 toll.

'UNWANTED CHILD' BEQUEATHS $200,000 TO SAN DIEGO PLANNED PARENTHOOD UNIT

Mark Salo, the head of Planned Parenthood here, remembers well how he met 
Edward John O'Toole more than a decade ago when the frail man walked into his 
office dressed in bold plaids and a baseball cap -- and clutching an airline 
bag. Salo politely asked if he could be of any help to the old man. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be the other way around. O'Toole opened his Pan Am flight bag, 
and Salo found himself staring at a bundle of bonds -- $50,000 worth. "I want 
Planned Parenthood to have this money," O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
And so began a strange, 11-year acquaintanceship between Salo and the 
mysterious visitor, who died recently at the age of 91 and left the Planned 
Parenthood affiliate his life's fortune of nearly $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that he had been an unwanted child who had been left by his 
mother," Salo said. "He never went into details, but it seemed to bother him 
terribly that he had been abandoned. He didn't want that to happen to any other 
child." 
</P>
<P>
At O'Toole's request, Salo said, the money will be used for education programs 
that stress family planning and services such as prenatal care, birth control, 
sterilization and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. O'Toole was perfectly lucid," Salo said. "He said things in a 
straightforward way, and told us that this is what he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
The bequest followed an agreement reached by the two men at the first meeting 
on July 7, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Salo hesitated in accepting the initial gift of bonds, suggesting that O'Toole 
instead put the money in a trust that would pay him interest. Then, if O'Toole 
still wanted Planned Parenthood to have his fortune, Salo told him, the 
organization would graciously accept it upon his death. O'Toole then created a 
trust fund with $70,000 in bonds and a life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
Salo never did learn much about the enigmatic O'Toole, who never married and 
had no children. The two men rarely met, and during the last year Salo had 
heard nothing from him. 
</P>
<P>
"He came into my office maybe a total of six or seven times," Salo said. "He 
never wanted anything back. I would say, 'Hello, Mr. O'Toole, how are you 
today?' There was some small talk, and then he left. He was a nice old man." 
</P>
<P>
"In all the time I knew him, I think we spent less than three hours together," 
Salo said. "He never wanted to take up much of my time." 
</P>
<P>
In early December, Salo received a note from San Diego Trust &amp; Savings. 
Edward O'Toole had died Nov. 15, 1988, the note said, and Planned Parenthood 
was the sole beneficiary of his trust. Bank officials say the account is worth 
nearly $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that we don't know more about this man," Salo said. "All I know 
is that he had a very unhappy childhood. He wanted people to really think about 
having children."

A California man alleged to be a major supplier of cocaine to local casino 
employees has been arrested by narcotics agents. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the arrest of Myron C. Thompson, 27, of Stockton, in a Reno 
casino climaxed a one-year undercover investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who lists his occupation as self-employed, was being held in Washoe 
County Jail in lieu of $250,315 bail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Listed 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested for investigation of conspiracy, trafficking in cocaine and 
possession for the sale of cocaine. He also was held for investigation of 
passing a bad check. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Thompson operated a Reno automobile body shop at one time, but 
was forced to close down by state officials because of undisclosed violations. 
</P>
<P>
They said he made regular trips to Reno after moving to Stockton.

A Boston man charged with stealing a wedding limousine tried to escape from 
custody using a gun made of soap, but he was foiled by a deputy sheriff, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Callahan, 35, was being taken from a holding cell in the basement of 
Dorchester District Court on Friday when he pulled the bogus gun, officers 
said. Deputy Frederick Pollini disarmed him with a karate chop. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan faces new charges in the escape attempt. He already is charged with 
robbing a tailor shop Dec. 17, then stealing a limousine carrying a bride and 
three members of the bridal party. He left the four in front of the church.

TRAINS KILL 4, INCLUDING DAREDEVIL PLAYING 'CHICKEN'

Four people, including a woman on her way to work and a young man playing 
"chicken" with friends, were killed by trains in Southern California, two of 
them in Los Angeles County, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, at 7 p.m. Friday, Lorenzo Ruelas, 35, of Oxnard was 
killed when he was hit by an Amtrak passenger train traveling 70 m.p.h. outside 
Oxnard, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Carl Schoenberger said. It has not been 
determined why Ruelas was walking on the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later Shawn James Schultz, 21, of Escondido was playing the daredevil 
game "chicken" with friends when he put his head on the tracks and was struck 
and killed by a southbound Amtrak train in Oceanside, Officer Lori Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
The Amtrak train bound for San Diego from Los Angeles was traveling about 30 
m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h. as it moved through the city about 40 miles north of San 
Diego, said Police Sgt. Richard Derouen. 
</P>
<P>
The friends did nothing as the engine ran over Shultz because "the object of 
the game is to see how long you can stay down," Derouen explained. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 a.m. Saturday a heavily tattooed man lying on railroad tracks in Sun 
Valley was run over by a freight train and killed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The train's crew told officers they saw the man as the locomotive approached 
but were unable to stop in time, Sgt. William Meier said. The victim, who was 
carrying no identification papers, had not been identified by late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 a.m. Saturday, a woman walking to work was struck and killed by a freight 
train as she stumbled and fell across tracks in El Monte, Sgt. Steve Schuster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Louise Johnson, 30, of Temple City was pronounced dead at the scene, 
Schuster said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was carrying a small bag containing her lunch when she stumbled while 
walking across a triple-track area. She was hit when she reached to pick up the 
contents of the bag, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was still dark at the time," Schuster said. He speculated that she 
misjudged the speed of the train.

OREGON TRIES TO BLOCK DEFENSE ACCESS TO ECCLESIA YOUTHS

Oregon's Justice Department has entered the legal fight over whether defense 
attorneys in the upcoming manslaughter trial of four Ecclesia Athletic Assn. 
members should be allowed to talk to children taken from the group by the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
State Appellate Division attorneys filed a request Friday that the Oregon 
Supreme Court block a Dec. 7 order by Clackamas County Judge John Lowe giving 
defense attorneys access to children taken from the group's rural Oregon camp. 
</P>
<P>
Four adult Ecclesia members face trial Feb. 6 in Clackamas County in the Oct. 
14 beating death of Dayna Broussard, the 8-year-old daughter of the Los 
Angeles-based group's founder, Eldridge Broussard Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys for Willie Chambers, 35; Brian Brinson, 30; Frederick 
Doolittle, 28, and Constance Jackson, 37, have sought to interview some of the 
53 children taken into state protective custody at the group's farmhouse near 
Sandy, east of Portland, hours after the girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
The group originally organized the farm near Sandy as an athletic training 
center to train inner-city youths from Los Angeles. However, state officials 
have alleged that the children were subject to ritualistic abuse, some beaten 
hundreds of times while the others were forced to keep count. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorneys were in a race with the clock in trying to block interviews 
with the children as Clackamas County prosecutors have been ordered to appear 
in Circuit Court next Tuesday to show why they should not be held in contempt 
of court for failing to produce the children. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Wednesday were granted their request for the order after 
attempts to set up interviews with the children were stalled while prosecutors 
waited to see if the Justice Department would review the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Linder, solicitor general for the state Justice Department, said the 
Supreme Court previously has ruled against trial court judges in criminal 
proceedings ordering the Children's Services Division to produce children in 
its custody for defense interviews or parents to produce children for the same 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
The question still undecided by the court is whether such judges can order 
prosecutors to produce a child for interviews when the child is in state 
custody, as in the Ecclesia case.

The Arab League said Saturday that the return of Egypt to the Arab fold is 
imminent, giving new hope to Arabs at the start of the New Year.

<P>
The league's secretary general, Chedli Klibi, said the cease-fire in the 
Iran-Iraq War, progress on the Palestinian question and rapprochement between 
North African states are other reasons for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"New avenues of hope now lie open before our nation . . . with the imminent 
return of Egypt into the fold and her resumption of her great mission within 
the Arab family," he said in a New Year message to Arabs.

An unidentified 53-year-old Los Angeles man was shot and killed by police 
Saturday after he stabbed an officer with a screwdriver after a disturbance on 
an RTD bus, authorities said.

Two Los Angeles police officers approached the bus at Vermont Avenue and 8th 
Street about 4 p.m. after receiving reports that a screwdriver-wielding man was 
causing problems on the bus, Lt. William Lewis said. When the suspect got off 
the bus and stabbed Officer Michael Grosso, 31, in the shoulder, then tried to 
stab another officer, Grosso shot him in the chest, Lewis said.

PROF. T. BLAISDELL; HELPED PLAN RECOVERY OF POSTWAR EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. YBARRA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas C. Blaisdell Jr., whose half-century of public service and scholarship 
included a prominent role in planning the reconstruction of postwar Europe, 
died Tuesday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
Blaisdell was a distinguished professor of political science at UC Berkeley who 
continued teaching long after assuming emeritus status in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
After a long career in public service starting in the New Deal era and 
culminating in his leadership in helping plan European recovery after World War 
II, Blaisdell joined the UC Berkeley faculty in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Active in publishing and lecturing well into retirement, Blaisdell taught 
freshman seminars in political science and international relations as recently 
as last year. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1895 in Pittsburgh, Pa., Blaisdell graduated from Pennsylvania State 
College in 1916. He earned a master's degree in social history at Columbia 
University in 1922 and his doctorate there in 1932. He taught at Columbia from 
1925 to 1932. 
</P>
<P>
In 1933, Blaisdell went to Washington to join Franklin D. Roosevelt's "brain 
trust" in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Over the next two 
decades, he held a number of federal positions, working first on helping the 
nation recover from the Depression and then on European postwar reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Blaisdell was assistant secretary of commerce during the Administration of 
President Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was modest about his role in postwar European recovery, colleagues 
have called him one of the principal architects of the Marshall Plan, 
proclaimed in 1947 by Secretary of State George C. Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
A widely published author, Blaisdell's best known work was "The American 
Presidency in Political Cartoons." Written with Peter Selz, a Berkeley art 
history professor, the 1976 book received wide acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
No services have been set. 
</P>
<P>
The family asked that donations be sent to the Fund for Cal in the Capital, the 
Young Musicians Program, both at UC Berkeley, or the Harry S. Truman Institute 
in Independence, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Blaisdell is survived by a son, Thomas; a brother, William; two grandchildren 
and two great-grandchildren.

SOVIET DISSIDENT YULI DANIEL; IMPRISONED FOR PUBLISHING ABROAD

<P>
Yuli Daniel, a satirist and poet whose 1966 trial with Andrei Sinyavsky was a 
worldwide sensation and marked the beginning of a long crackdown on dissidents, 
died at his home Friday, his former wife said. 
</P>
<P>
Larisa Bogoraz, a veteran of the Soviet dissident movement who was Daniel's 
wife when he was sentenced to five years in prison and labor camp, said he died 
of a stroke. Daniel was 63 and had been in ill health for years. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel's most famous work, "This is Moscow Calling," satirically called for a 
"Public Murder Day," in which Soviets over the age of 16 would be allowed to 
kill someone as long as it was not a policeman or a public transport worker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Published Under Glasnost 
</P>
<P>
Under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater 
openness, some of Daniel's works written in prison camp were published in 
Moscow in July as he lay in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel and Sinyavsky, conscious of the ostracism of Nobel Prize-winning author 
Boris Pasternak for publishing his novel "Doctor Zhivago" abroad, used the 
pseudonyms Nikolai Arzhak and Abram Terts, respectively, to publish their works 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Despite persecution of writers such as Pasternak, Premier Nikita S. 
Khrushchev's years were relatively free for writers, and came to be known as 
"The Thaw." 
</P>
<P>
But Daniel and Sinyavsky were arrested in the autumn of 1965, less than a year 
after Khrushchev was ousted by a group of Kremlin leaders from which Leonid I. 
Brezhnev eventually would emerge as the most powerful. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel received a five-year term in prison and labor camp for illegally 
publishing his works abroad, and Sinyavsky was sentenced to seven years. It was 
the first time that criminal charges were brought against Soviet intellectuals 
for literary criticism of the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents, KGB agents and foreign correspondents huddled outside the Moscow 
courtroom where they were tried, and rushed to get word of the proceedings when 
the defendants' wives would come out during breaks. News of the trial was 
broadcast back into the Soviet Union by foreign radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin followed their trial with a long and determined crackdown on 
dissidents and unofficial publications, but during the late 1960s unofficial 
publications and the number of dissidents grew nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ended Dissident Activities 
</P>
<P>
Daniel lived and worked in Kaluga and Moscow after he finished his prison term, 
but did not take part in further dissident activities. Sinyavsky emigrated to 
Paris after serving his term. 
</P>
<P>
The publication Ogonyok, in printing Daniel's prison camp poetry, called him a 
"war veteran and man of difficult fate." 
</P>
<P>
Included in the poems published in July was "The Ring," in which Daniel 
appeared to be describing his trial as a boxing match. 
</P>
<P>
Bogoraz said that Daniel was survived by his wife, Irina Uvarova, a son and 
grandson.

THE 4 FRESHMEN; 
</P>
<P>
VISION OF COALITION COMES UNRAVELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One year ago, their election began the most complete overhaul of the San Diego 
City Council in a decade. Four educated, ambitious, politically savvy men -- 
they were the first group to take their seats together as newcomers since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
They were instantly nicknamed The Four Freshmen, and they almost as quickly 
predicted that they could become a force on the nine-member council. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going into office as a coalition of sorts," District 8 Councilman Bob 
Filner said the day after he was elected with the 2nd District's Ron Roberts, 
4th District's Wes Pratt and 6th District's Bruce Henderson. "People may wonder 
how or where the mayor and the current council members might get votes from us. 
But, on the other hand, with four of us coming in, we only need to pick up one 
vote to do what we want to." 
</P>
<P>
As Filner could best attest, it has not worked out that way. The freshmen's 
political differences soon dashed any semblance of a coalition forged in the 
heat of the campaign, and their fortunes have followed divergent paths. 
</P>
<P>
But each began to carve a niche for himself as the council fought and lost the 
battle to rein in growth, confirmed a new police chief, selected a site for a 
new Civic Center, grappled with an expensive sewage problem, authorized yet 
another study of how to relocate the airport, endorsed Mayor Maureen O'Connor's 
Soviet arts festival and raised hotel taxes to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look, in district order, at the Four Freshmen's first two semesters. 
</P>
<P>
The day after he was elected, District 2 Councilman, Ron Roberts promised to 
"hit the ground running." These days, it is said around City Hall, Roberts is 
running -- for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Friend to All Issues 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, whose district stretches from Point Loma to Mission Hills, greets 
returning warships, fires starter's pistols at track meets, cuts ribbons, 
accepts awards and gives speeches. His energy is so boundless, his presence so 
ubiquitous, his name in the news so often, that it is difficult to remember he 
has been on council only a year. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts has yet to meet an issue he doesn't like. Whether it is growth 
management, safety and noise at Lindbergh Field or sewage treatment and water 
reclamation, Roberts has studied it, and he has a plan for improving it. 
</P>
<P>
More than any of the four new council members -- perhaps more than any other 
council member except Gloria McColl -- Roberts has nimbly stepped into the 
power vacuum created by the city's weak mayor form of government and O'Connor's 
hands-off leadership style. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Reviews 
</P>
<P>
At year's end, he had positioned himself in a tenuous coalition of five 
moderate-to-conservative Republicans that could dominate the nine-member 
council if its members can overcome longstanding differences among them. At the 
same time, he remains close to O'Connor, who endorsed only him among the eight 
candidates in the 1987 election. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Roberts' adventures have backfired. An attempt to remove the city's 
highly successful Motion Picture and Television Bureau from the Chamber of 
Commerce led to an embarrassing defeat and ill will from the chamber. "I would 
do that differently if I had it all to do over again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth activists, who had high hopes for Roberts when O'Connor endorsed 
him as "someone who knows how to say 'no' to developers," now consider him the 
architect of some of Proposition H's worst features. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron Roberts talks like Mr. Rogers but votes like Attila the Hun," was a 
standard campaign stump line from Citizens for Limited Growth's Peter Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts deftly handles speculation about his ambition. "The things I'm doing 
are because that's how I interpret the job of being on the council. If there 
is, at a later date, a reward in citizens 
</P>
<P>
saying, 'We're willing to to let you step up to a higher office,' that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, who this month began a new four-year term in office, has heard the 
whispers about Roberts' ambition but is unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to tell you, I think they're all running for mayor. Everybody's running 
for mayor. Secretly, and I'll talk generically, any council member who serves 
as a council member has kind of a little, secret desire to one day be mayor," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy is 'good government is good politics,' " she added, "I work 
hard, I try to serve the community well. It's their choice. What will be will 
be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Profile Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Blessed with intelligence, drive and an All-American, good-guy personality, 
Roberts has benefited from the fact that the issues he is best able to tackle 
are among the city's most high-profile concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' district includes Lindbergh Field, so he is a natural to work on the 
pressing matters of noise and safety at the airport -- issues watched closely 
throughout the region. Point Loma is home to the city's only sewage treatment 
plant, so Roberts has become outspoken on the city's need for a $1.5-billion 
upgrading of its sewer-treatment system, and, more specifically, on the need to 
develop water reclamation technology. 
</P>
<P>
As an architect and former chairman of the Planning Commission, Roberts was 
installed as chairman of the committee that wrote Proposition H, the council's 
growth-management plan. He became the leading spokesman for it during the 
unsuccessful election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts' success is mostly of his own making. He worked with Point Loma 
residents and the Port District to fashion the compromise plan approved this 
month that will limit noise from takeoffs and landings at Lindbergh. He has 
ridden in an airplane cockpit to assess the danger, if any, posed by the Laurel 
Travel Center building at the foot of the airport runway. He is involved in 
discussions with the Navy to reshape the landscape at the foot of Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Roberts finds time for his district. He has worked to revitalize Ocean 
Beach and is helping Point Loma's planning board devise ways to lessen 
peak-hour traffic, caused largely by sailors, on Catalina Boulevard and 
Rosecrans Street. 
</P>
<P>
"That man is working day and night," said Ann Jackson, chairman of the 
Peninsula Community Planning Board. "I feel very fortunate that he chose to 
leave the architectural profession and try serving the city and the community. 
He's doing a wonderful job." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts points to a new downtown plan, a new waterfront plan, the 
growth-control debate and the airport as his major issues in 1989. He also will 
be heavily involved in the council's redistricting efforts and is rumored to 
want to add a chunk of downtown to his district. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Pratt took office, took one look at the crying needs in his impoverished 
council district and took to the streets of Southeast San Diego. He lectures 
schoolchildren on the evils of drugs, marches to protest gang violence and goes 
door-to-door exhorting homeowners in the battle against crack dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Long before district elections were approved by voters in the November, Pratt, 
the council's lone black member, focused his energy on the concerns of his 
largely minority constituents in the 4th District, which includes Southeast San 
Diego, Encanto, Paradise Hills and most of the California 94 corridor. If that 
meant that his colleagues would grab the limelight, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I would simply concentrate on district-related issues and getting 
out into the district," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His record is true to that decision. In his first year, Pratt sought more money 
for social services to AIDS victims, a growing concern of the minority 
community. He championed the losing Charter Review Commission ballot initiative 
for a tough police review board and was critical of the police shooting of 
Tommie Dubose during an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
He was actively involved in the negotiations to sell Southeast's San Diego 
Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital, and at year's end was leading the effort to 
have the city's Convention Center named for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the 
slain civil rights leader 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staying Above the Fray 
</P>
<P>
Pratt has developed a reputation for staying above the fray on City Hall's 10th 
floor, where the deal-cutting and alliance-building among council members can 
be fast-paced. That stance has allowed Pratt to acquire some power as a 
somewhat unpredictable swing vote on the nine-member council. It was Pratt, for 
example, who came back from his sickbed to break a 4-4 tie on the size of the 
increase of the city's hotel room tax. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't ask to be in that position," he said. "It's just the way I conduct 
myself in the City Council is to be pretty straightforward and not ally myself 
with one faction or another." 
</P>
<P>
Herb Cawthorne, executive director of the San Diego Urban League, believes 
Pratt "has done an exceptional job. He's surprised a lot of people with his 
ability to grasp the larger issues. He has a tremendous amount of pressure on 
him, because his balance makes him the swing factor a lot of times. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, as he matures, he will learn to exercise the power in more 
far-reaching ways," Cawthorne added. 
</P>
<P>
George Stevens, an aide to Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Pratt's opponent in 
the council race, praises Pratt for his stand on the police review issue and 
for his responsiveness to neighborhood needs. 
</P>
<P>
But Stevens believes that Pratt should be supporting a committee recommendation 
to include King's full name in the convention center title instead of Pratt's 
proposal of "San Diego King Convention Center." And he believes Pratt should 
have gotten an even larger share of this year's Community Development block 
grant money than the $2 million his district received. 
</P>
<P>
A rare politician who does not feel the need to give extended speeches before 
each vote, the quiet, burly Pratt has earned the respect of colleagues with his 
allegiance to doing what is right. 
</P>
<P>
"Wes Pratts don't come along very often," said Mayor Maureen O'Connor. "He's 
got a rare quality about him." And "99% of the time he's on the side of the 
angels," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically want to be about the business of good government," Pratt said. "I 
will continue to do that. I don't feel I have to wave a big flag. Wes Pratt is 
not going to be here forever. People have to take up the mantle and serve." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Henderson has taken a prominent role in some important citywide and 
district issues. Henderson was the architect of Proposition K, the advisory 
ballot measure calling for a mandatory, citywide program of staggered work 
hours to reduce peak-hour traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Along with several other council members, he has championed an ordinance to 
preserve single-family neighborhoods, which make up a sizable part of his 6th 
District, which includes Pacific Beach, Mission Beach and Clairemont. He led 
the fight to equip the city's police force with two helicopters captured from 
drug runners. One chopper is now operating and the other is being outfitted. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson continues to be the council's maverick on its $1.5-billion sewer 
system upgrade, insisting that the effort is not necessary. He also led 
opposition to a $1.5-million consulting contract to publicize the issue, 
narrowly losing his effort to sharply reduce the program, but managing to pare 
$300,000 from the price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that sizable first-year agenda, Henderson is best known inside City 
Hall for the publicity stunts, his long, sometimes unfocused speeches and his 
class-clown tendency to interrupt colleagues during council sessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blowup Sharks, Posters 
</P>
<P>
Henderson has filled the council chamber with the ominous background music from 
the film "Jaws" and adorned the room with inflatable sharks to make his point 
that "consultant sharks" are feeding on public tax dollars. He altered a "Jaws" 
poster to show the shark munching a dollar bill. 
</P>
<P>
His "Fly Me" poster focused attention on the helicopters. He handed out a 
commuter survival kit at a press conference to exhort voters to approve 
Proposition K. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson has "a sense of humor, a different way of doing things," said 
O'Connor, who concedes she has at times become exasperated trying to silence 
Henderson at council meetings. "He has fun and doesn't take it personally. . . 
. He does make you laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"He tries to exaggerate to make his point. And, through his exaggerations, he 
makes his points. That's his way of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson agrees that he's trying "just to have a little fun" during council 
meetings that can stretch eight hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
"The sharks captured the council's attention," he said. "I didn't win, but at 
least I saved the city $300,000." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admits to 'Fine Line' 
</P>
<P>
But, he acknowledges, "I have to be careful because there's a fine line between 
using them and amusing (council members) and over-using them and irritating 
(council members)." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the clowning, council members agree, is a keen mind and a financial 
acumen that many other council members lack. Henderson has also concentrated on 
his district, focusing on a traffic study of Mission Bay, Pacific Beach and La 
Jolla and closely scrutinizing requests for exemptions from the city's Interim 
Development Ordinance in his neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
He has also maneuvered himself into the chairmanship of the Public Facilities 
and Recreation Committee, where he will have a more direct impact on Mission 
Bay Park. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson was perhaps the council's most outspoken opponent of the 
growth-management plan, though he did vote for it after weeks of negotiation. 
"I didn't like H . . ., " he said of Proposition H. "I was very pleased by the 
voters, that they rejected it." Henderson called the voters' decision "a 
reaffirmation of representative democracy," because it put the future of growth 
management back in the council's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, "I think, has been less of an environmental supporter than we had 
expected," said Barbara Bamberger, the Sierra Club's conservation coordinator. 
"And we didn't expect much." 
</P>
<P>
This has not been Bob Filner's month. 
</P>
<P>
It started Nov. 29 when a coalition of five council members relieved him of 
$1.7 million in Community Development block grant funds that City Manager John 
Lockwood had recommended for his 8th District. The following day, the same 
group turned down O'Connor's suggestion that Filner head a council committee 
and installed Henderson as chairman instead. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, they were at it again, refusing to allow Filner to represent the 
council on the Metropolitan Transit Development Board. 
</P>
<P>
Filner's colleagues say they were trying to teach him a lesson. They say he is 
abrasive, that he takes political and philosophical debate and raises it to the 
level of personal attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob tends to personalize it: 'you're evil, you're bad, you're mean, you've 
broken the law, and I don't like you, and I'm going to take my football and go 
home,' " Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, one of the group of moderate-to-conservative Republicans who 
engineered Filner's thrashing, claims he was motivated by Filner's attempt, 
during back-corridor wrangling over committee chairmanships, to put together a 
slate that would have left Roberts without a chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convenient Target? 
</P>
<P>
Filner remains defiant, claiming that the group he has dubbed "the Gang of 
Five" was motivated by common ideological and political goals, not personal 
ones. As perhaps the council's most liberal member, Filner believes he makes a 
convenient target. 
</P>
<P>
"The defeat of the H and J has emboldened the pro-development forces on the 
council," he said, referring to council members Ron Roberts, Bruce Henderson, 
Judy McCarty, Ed Struiksma and Gloria McColl. "I think that's what is behind 
some of the recent votes with the Gang of Five. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an ideological, partisan effort to make sure I am kept weak," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He does not deny trying to put together a slate of committee chairmen without 
Roberts on it. "Why is my attempting to put together a slate that's helpful to 
me any worse or better than his trying to put together a slate that's 
beneficial to him?," he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that Roberts had the votes to win and Filner didn't. Votes are 
the bottom line, said Andrea Skorepa, executive director of a San Ysidro social 
service agency and a Filner antagonist who supported his opponent, Mike 
Aguirre, in the most recent election. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, for our community, he hasn't been as effective a representative as he 
could be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, Filner watched helplessly as the council overruled his 
recommendation and gave a publicly run recreation center in his district to 
Skorepa's organization. 
</P>
<P>
The internal conflict has overshadowed Filner's accomplishments in his large, 
meandering district, which stretches from Hillcrest through downtown and 
includes San Ysidro and Otay Mesa. A fanatical worker, he is perhaps the 
council's most cerebral member, who has a tendency to intellectual honesty even 
if his views are not politically popular. He is on leave from San Diego State 
University, where he teaches history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Filner was the only council member to oppose placing Charter Commission 
initiatives directly on the ballot without review, arguing that the position 
was an abdication of the council's responsibilities. In recent months, some of 
his colleagues have begun to agree. 
</P>
<P>
Filner guided the Balboa Park Master Plan to adoption, insisting that it call 
for maximizing open space. He has brought capital improvement funds to South 
Bay parks and worked on the revitalization of San Ysidro Boulevard. Last month 
he called for higher taxes to put more police on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
Filner has proven himself one of the council's most ardent slow-growth 
advocates and remains a solid pro-environment vote. He has defended the Sierra 
Club from attempts to oust the organization from its Balboa Park office. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Filner is one of the few consistent supporters, who has been out there and 
has been aggressively fighting for the preservation of open space and sensitive 
lands," said the Sierra Club's Bamberger. 
</P>
<P>
Filner pledged to soften his tone if it will mean more success for his 
district, which could be vulnerable in next year's redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to look at my own behavior," he said. "If it's hurting me from 
achieving things for my district, that will change." 
</P>
<P>
But he adds: "I'm an outspoken person. I represent a district that has 
historically been powerless. I'm going to continue to (be outspoken). If that 
gets me into trouble, so be it." 
</P>

SUPPORT FOR SHERIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was quite surprised at how uninformed the L.A. Times was in writing the 
editorial on Sheriff Duffy, ("It's Time to Hear From Sheriff Duffy," Dec. 11). 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Union reported a case where an ex-deputy was cleared by a jury of 
brutality. A victory for the Sheriff's Department. This jury saw through the 
absurdity of this lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
It should be against the law to file frivolous lawsuits. The courts are already 
overburdened. It's a waste of taxpayers' money. These claims of brutality are 
probably being blown out of proportion, never occurred, or cons trying to con 
the county out of money. In fact, I hope that the sheriff's deputies 
countersue. 
</P>
<P>
The Times says that Duffy should speak out. Well, I'm sure that the reason he 
or his designated official won't say anything is that anything they say might 
be detrimental to the cases. He has already won one case, and I'm sure he'll 
win more without saying anything. 
</P>
<P>
The Times wants to consider a civilian review board. A law enforcement 
officer's worst nightmare is to have a civilian, who is not trained in the law 
enforcement procedures, who does not have to deal with the bad side of the 
public, to judge whether the law enforcement officer was right or wrong. All 
The Times has to do is check their stories to see that the Sheriff's Department 
does "police" its own. The media have reported at least three cases, that I 
know of, where sheriff's deputies were fired from the department and/or cases 
taken to the district attorney for criminal charges to be filed. I say no to a 
civilian review board. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, the Sheriff's Department is doing a good job. To reiterate what 
I saw on a bumper sticker, "San Diego County Sheriff -- Law Enforcement at its 
Best."

A CHARGED IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An idea recently occurred to me that may be worthy of community support. 
Because San Diego is considering buying out San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, how 
about going ahead and acquiring the Chargers as well? Just ponder the plethora 
of possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
Lighting the stadium would be absolutely free, and Charger fans may be eligible 
to apply for a rebate on ticket prices from the Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
As part of incentive clauses for free agents, the city/Chargers could offer 
such bonuses as light bulbs, generators, consulting fees and preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, in her spare time, could coach the team. 
</P>
<P>
We could trade Tom Page and Steve Ortmayer for a Tucson utility and a 
substance-abusing linebacker to be named later. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the Russian arts festival, the Chargers might scrimmage with members 
of the Kirov Ballet. Perhaps the San Diego Chicken could hatch out of a giant 
Faberge egg during halftime and do a humorous rendition of Swan Lake. 
</P>
<P>
If all this wouldn't give that mean old ogre of a Howard Allen from Southern 
California Edison fits, I don't know what will. Think about it, San Diego. 
SDG&amp;E and the Chargers . . . what an electric combo! Why, everybody, not 
just the skinheads, could go out and paint the old town red.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT: CRUMBS FOR MIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dec. 18 article ("Breaking Camp") relating to the housing problem of 
migrant farm workers in North San Diego County was indeed upsetting, but not 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
During my four years as California state director of migrant education, I had 
the opportunity to visit many migrant camps and other farm worker housing 
throughout the state. The impressions leave a lasting dismal memory in my mind 
. . . as well as deep anger that our society can treat one segment of our 
population so callously. 
</P>
<P>
To the farmer, as well as the community, the workers are an implement to be 
used for bringing in the crops, then to be ignored, like machinery or farm 
animals. They are not perceived as human beings. . . . like you and me. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they are very human . . . perhaps most of them are more decent humans than 
many of us. They live in a close-knit family, loyal to each other, with high 
moral values, and of deep religious beliefs. They are a proud people, unwilling 
to take a "handout": welfare or social services for which they have not worked. 
Crime, drug or alcohol abuse is rare in these families. 
</P>
<P>
Housing is always a problem. They stay in a community for only part of a year. 
Thus, permanent housing is out of the question. Rental payment for middle-class 
apartments or houses is well beyond their means. So they are forced to live in 
camps, caves, shacks, trailers, their cars . . . wherever. Consequently, both 
they and their children tend to be of poor health, with little chance to learn 
English and not accepted as part of the community. 
</P>
<P>
During the '60s, over 20 camps were built for the migratory farm workers in the 
central valleys of California. The funds came from the federal government to 
the state, which built the camps cooperatively with the counties, which then 
managed the camps that were built on land donated by farmers. These facilities 
are fairly decent temporary housing, and far better than the alternative. Each 
camp houses about 100 families; and several hundred are turned away each year 
because supply does not meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, I am on the board of directors of the Coachella Valley Housing 
Coalition. We are a small, nonprofit organization, building farm worker 
housing, both apartments and self-help homes. Our first two projects, built 
with federal and state funds, provided very decent multi-bedroom housing for 
100 families, and we are funded for an additional 140 units. Five hundred 
families applied for the first 50 units. We'll keep building until all families 
are out of the ditches and shacks and filthy camps . . . or until the money 
runs out. 
</P>
<P>
So I read about the solution used in North San Diego County: bulldoze the only 
housing the farm workers have been able to provide for themselves! Assure that 
14,000 workers and their families are homeless. Despite the rationalizations by 
the local officials, this action is the most brutal which has yet come to my 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
I guess Congressman Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) speaks for the majority of the 
folks in that area when he throws the responsibility for finding housing and 
meeting health regulations back on the migrant workers. I wish he could spend a 
few days living under their circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
There are solutions. Let the growers, who need the workers, donate a few acres 
each for camps. At the state level, Proposition 84 specifically provides $10 
million for the construction of migrant farm labor camps. It wouldn't take 
much, in terms of federal or state spending. And, provide something more decent 
than the current proposal down there: a 14-foot plastic unit to house a family 
of four. Unbelievable! Would Congressman Packard move his family into such a 
unit? 
</P>
<P>
Just think! If readers of this letter are compassionate, or if they are 
Republicans who believe the private sector should solve all problems . . . if 
all those readers contributed $10 each; then that money might be sufficient to 
house an awful lot of workers who provide the food on our table, and who live 
worse than any other segment of our population. 
</P>
<P>
But then, who really cares?

LINGUISTS DELVE MANY MILLENIA INTO PAST TO FIND MAN'S MOTHER TONGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If this renegade group of linguists could board a time machine, they probably 
would press the accelerator to the floor -- moving backward through the ages to 
a time before Sanskrit, English, Punjabi or Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Hurtling back to a remote part of the past before people ever learned to farm, 
past the era when humans first used fire to a period 100,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
That is the time they think they will find the critical evidence, the seedlings 
that produced all of the world's languages, something they like to call the 
Mother Tongue of Man. 
</P>
<P>
Such a discovery, this group of mostly Soviet and East European researchers 
believe, would prove what is called the monogenesis of language, the evolution 
of the spoken word from a single tongue. 
</P>
<P>
But while even these scientists think the 100,000-year mark could eventually 
prove to be too deep in the remote past, they have made headway in 
reconstructing hundreds of words they believe were spoken 15,000 to 30,000 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Historical linguist Vitaly Shevoroshkin of the University of Michigan in Ann 
Arbor sees a host of applications for biology and anthropology in the work he 
and his colleagues in the Soviet Union have done. 
</P>
<P>
For one, the evolution of language not only shows "how some words have become 
petrified," by not changing much over time but also how people have migrated 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he laments the work has generated little interest in the West. 
</P>
<P>
To hear Shevoroshkin tell it, only a handful of Americans are interested in 
learning the words spoken by early Homo sapiens sapiens, the prehistoric humans 
whom paleobiologists believe first appeared 100,000 years ago and are the 
direct ancestors of modern people. 
</P>
<P>
Shevoroshkin theorizes that it is possible to pinpoint at least a few original 
words of man, elements from a language that served as the progenitor for all of 
those ever spoken on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to reconstruct the proto-proto-proto language, if you will, the 
Mother Tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"A proto language means a language family like Indo-European. If you say 
proto-proto that's an ancestor of a family, not everybody accepts that idea 
especially people in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you say proto-proto-proto, that's something completely different. 
Perhaps we may not find the mother tongue, the language of the world, maybe we 
can go back only 30,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a big gap between people speaking some type of language 30,000 years 
ago and one spoken 100,000 years ago. That is a very big gap and we don't know 
how to fill it." 
</P>
<P>
As part of his quest, however, Shevoroshkin hopes to find the links that tie 
the world's languages together and link them to the past. 
</P>
<P>
To this end, he is building on the work of Soviet linguists Sergei Starostin, 
Vladislav Marakovic Illic-Svityc and Aaron Dolgopolsky who more than 20 years 
ago tediously reconstructed a language spoken 15,000 years ago they call 
Nostratic, which means "our language." 
</P>
<P>
Shevoroshkin said 1,000 words of Nostratic have been reconstructed by analysis 
of common elements from languages he and other scholars believe grew out of the 
ancient tongue. 
</P>
<P>
Nostratic, they believe, gave rise to the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, 
Kartvelian, Euralic, Dravidian, Altaic and Eskimo-Aleutian language families. 
Hence, making Nostratic a superfamily of languages, or as Shevoroshkin would 
put it -- a proto-proto language. 
</P>
<P>
His hope is to continue on to the proto-proto-proto stage, if he can find the 
clues that will link him to the remote past. 
</P>
<P>
Language is unique to the human species, Shevoroshkin said, and one of the 
primary characteristics like upright walking and a highly evolved brain that 
set humans apart from their cousin primates, the Great Apes. 
</P>
<P>
He believes by way of a technique called deep reconstruction, he can tap into 
the vocabularies of ancient humans, seeking first those elements that exist in 
every language in the world -- first and second person pronouns and names for 
parts of the body. 
</P>
<P>
Such studies produced one of the startling findings in Nostratic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By studying the word for "eye" in many languages, Soviet researchers were able 
to surmise what the word was in Nostratic. 
</P>
<P>
"In English, the word is eye. But in German it is auge, very similar. In old 
Russian it is oko and in Nostratic we believe it was huka." 
</P>
<P>
Words for nature also lend themselves to historic analysis, he said, 
emphasizing that because there was no agriculture before 10,000 years ago there 
are no words for domesticated animals other than dog. 
</P>
<P>
Nostratic scholars have been able to trace that noun among others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But even Shevoroshkin admits this is an arduous task and acknowledges that many 
historical linguists doubt he can delve too deeply into the remote past to find 
a language before Nostratic. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford University linguistic anthropologist Joseph Greenberg, who has 
developed a technique called mass comparisons for analyzing various languages, 
is one who questions how well Shevoroshkin will do. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, himself interested in the evolution of the various languages of the 
world, prefers not to seek the vocabularies of early humankind but to classify 
Earth's myriad tongues past and present. 
</P>
<P>
His work produced the classification of African languages in the 1950s, the 
groupings generally accepted by linguists today. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg would not call the efforts of Shevoroshkin and his co-investigators 
futile but allowed the exercise could prove tedious. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough to show that all human languages have a common origin," said 
Greenberg. "I think the really interesting part comes in constructing a family 
tree (of languages)." 
</P>
<P>
But the problem with family trees, Shevoroshkin said, is that it is easy to 
leave out vast groups of languages and never show how one is related to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"Linguists divide languages into several families such as Uralic, Indo-European 
or Afro-Asiatic, and so on. They usually say they are not related and if they 
are there is no proof. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to find the proof and to go beyond that," Shevoroshkin 
said of his endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
"People in this area usually talk about relationships and that makes little 
sense to me," offered Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
But linguist Merritt Ruhlen, formerly of Stanford, acknowledged recently in the 
journal Science that Shevoroshkin probably is right, that there is an ancient 
link tying the world's languages to a common tongue.

TRYING TIME FOR NEW COURTHOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY, BUILDER BATTLE OVER UNFINISHED VAN NUYS PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At its unveiling in mid-October, it was hailed as one of the finest court 
buildings in the nation, a gleaming glass-and-granite edifice to justice that 
would thrust the San Fernando Valley into the forefront of courthouse design. 
</P>
<P>
But the new $52-million Van Nuys Municipal Courthouse may become the subject of 
litigation unless a multimillion-dollar dispute between the contractor and Los 
Angeles County officials is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, plans had called for Municipal Court personnel to move into the 
plush, 11-story, 23-court building, which has its own helipad, 10th-floor 
balcony and state-of-the-art security system, in August. 
</P>
<P>
But 4 months later, the new building is still occupied by construction workers. 
The Municipal Court staff continues to use cramped, makeshift quarters in 
bungalows and trailers and on a floor of the Van Nuys Superior Court building 
next door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Locked in Negotiations 
</P>
<P>
County officials and Sylmar-based Tutor-Saliba Corp., the contractor, are 
locked in negotiations over claims that each side is responsible for the delays 
and owes the other millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The county on Dec. 1 assessed Tutor-Saliba with late penalties of $3 million 
for failing to have the building ready by Aug. 15, the completion date 
specified in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
The penalties will continue to mount at the rate of $28,000 for each day beyond 
the completion date, said Thomas V. Schriber, the county's chief manager on the 
courthouse project. The total by the end of December was $3.8 million, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Such penalties are standard in construction projects and were spelled out in 
the 1985 contract between the county and Tutor-Saliba, the low bidder for the 
project, Schriber said. 
</P>
<P>
The penalties represent the cost to the county of not being able to occupy the 
building, he said. For instance, the county must keep inspectors and project 
managers at the site, lease space elsewhere and pay other costs because the new 
building is not yet open, Schriber said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Contested 
</P>
<P>
Tutor-Saliba is contesting the extra charges and accuses the county of causing 
the delays. Tutor-Saliba has filed a claim seeking $1.7 million from the county 
for costs that the company says it has incurred because of the delays. 
</P>
<P>
"On numerous occasions over the past 8 months, this office has advised your 
firm . . . of our serious concern over your firm's lack of progress on 
completing this project," Schriber wrote in a Dec. 1 letter to Tutor-Saliba. 
</P>
<P>
Schriber's letter said work was not complete on courthouse communications and 
elevator systems, nor on mechanical, fire, safety and electrical systems. 
</P>
<P>
It cited the need to replace damaged glass windows, carpets and doors that were 
not inspected for fire safety. 
</P>
<P>
"To our view, the contractor is not performing as well as we would like," said 
Jim Abbott, senior deputy director of the county Facilities Management 
Department. "It's fair to say the quality of the work is fine; it's just that 
it's taking longer to get the work done than we feel it should have. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the courthouse dedication was held," Abbott said, Tutor-Saliba "lost 
their concentration on the job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
President Blames County 
</P>
<P>
Ronald N. Tutor, Tutor-Saliba's president, scoffed at the charges and accused 
the county of "trying to cover up their own inadequacies" by blaming the 
contractor for delays. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a bunch of nonsense. The job is being finished up in spite of the 
county, not because of it," Tutor said. "The county couldn't build a building 
on time if it tried. 
</P>
<P>
"They know they don't have a prayer in hell of collecting any part" of the 
penalty fees, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Tutor said the project has taken longer than scheduled because the county has 
repeatedly changed specifications, a charge that Abbott denies. Tutor claims 
that the company is entitled to more time to complete the project without late 
penalties because the county has required so many changes. 
</P>
<P>
The delays are inconveniencing Municipal Court personnel in Van Nuys, said 
Aviva K. Bobb, the court's presiding judge. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned by the 6-month delay in occupying the building. We are 
anxious to move in as soon as possible," Bobb said. "The major hardship has 
been that the court is spread all over the block. . . . It causes a lot of 
delays, inefficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
The county has also had to delay plans to renovate the Superior Court building 
and to open Juvenile Courts in bungalows now occupied by Municipal courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The latest tentative plans call for the county to occupy the courthouse in 
mid-January and open it to the public in mid-February, said Peggy Shuttleworth, 
Valley division chief of the Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The building still has to pass inspection by county employees and state fire 
marshals, Abbott said. It has failed several preliminary fire inspections in 
part because doors were not properly fitted and certified as fire-resistant, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The county is trying to resolve the problems through negotiations with the 
company's top management, Abbott said. If negotiations break down, a lawsuit is 
one of several options that would be considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Tutor-Saliba fails to finish the job, Schriber said, the county would 
suspend the firm's contract and have the work done elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The building was formally dedicated Oct. 14 at a ceremony attended by more than 
500 people, including county and court officials, politicians and state Supreme 
Court Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Graffiti-Resistant Interior 
</P>
<P>
The new courthouse features a graffiti-resistant interior; electronic message 
boards, similar to those used at ballparks, to provide information on court 
services, and a specially designed, high-security courtroom featuring a 
bulletproof glass shield to separate spectators from trial participants. The 
court's advanced security system features metal detectors, baggage X-ray 
machines and closed-circuit cameras in public hallways and high-volume 
courtrooms as well as custody areas. 
</P>
<P>
The courthouse was funded by the sale of public bonds and by the Robbins 
Construction Fund, which adds a penalty assessment to traffic and parking 
tickets, said Jerry Orland, head of the project management division of the 
Facilities Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time that Tutor-Saliba has been accused of foot-dragging on 
a county courthouse project. The contractor is building a $19-million Los 
Angeles Municipal Courthouse in Cerritos, which is 6 months behind schedule and 
has engendered similar charges and countercharges, Orland said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the same boat there," Orland said. 
</P>
<P>
Tutor-Saliba is one of the largest general contractors in California, ranking 
70th nationwide in 1987 with $305.3 million in contract awards, according to 
Engineering News-Record, a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
Tutor-Saliba was awarded an $18.3-million contract by the state Department of 
Transportation to widen a 2-mile stretch of the Ventura Freeway from Valley 
Circle Boulevard to White Oak Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built Airport Terminal 
</P>
<P>
The company built the $125-million Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los 
Angeles International Airport and is doing $124 million worth of work on the 
Metro Rail subway project in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the items cited in the county's Dec. 1 letter have since been fixed, 
but some problems remain, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent tour of the courthouse, county inspectors pointed out such defects 
as seams and discolorations on carpets, scratches on glass windows and walls 
that needed touch-up paint. Other problems included double doors that must be 
replaced because they were too narrow to lock and wheelchair lifts that failed 
to function during a recent inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, a lot of the changes are just cosmetic stuff and 98% of the 
work is already done," said Mike McNeil, county building inspector. "But when 
you're talking about a $52-million building, that 2% adds up to a lot of little 
things left to be done."

GETTING TO KNOW HIM; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIARITY WITH CURTIS R. TUCKER JR. MAY BE IN NAME ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is Curtis R. Tucker Jr.? 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, he was a little-known legislative aide whose father -- Curtis 
R. Tucker, the feisty political patriarch of Inglewood -- was on his way to an 
eighth term as assemblyman from the 50th District. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the younger Tucker is considered the heavy favorite in a special 
election to replace his father, who died of cancer in October. One of the 
state's most powerful politicians, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco), has made it clear that he intends to use his financial and 
political muscle to get Tucker elected. Brown even persuaded Gov. George 
Deukmejian to move up the election from April 11 to Feb. 7, shortening the time 
that other candidates have to raise money and campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's heavy support for Tucker appears to have discouraged several other 
potentially strong candidates from entering the race. The four candidates who 
decided to run against Tucker are considered unlikely to raise enough money to 
compete with Brown's resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little-Known Candidate 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, many elected officials and others in Inglewood -- the political 
heart of the district -- say they know little about Tucker. The other 
candidates in the race plan to exploit the voters' lack of familiarity with 
Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
"Why hasn't he made himself known?" asks candidate Rod Wright, a veteran 
political consultant. "You don't say, 'My father did this and this, so vote for 
me.' That's not the way it works in America." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker acknowledges that he has kept a low profile in the district. While his 
brother-in-law, John Gibbs, served as the assemblyman's legislative aide in the 
50th District, Tucker worked five years as an aide to mid-Wilshire Assemblyman 
Mike Roos, the Assembly speaker pro tem, before going to work for Assemblywoman 
Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) in the neighboring 49th District eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't spent as much time in the (50th) district as I would have liked," 
Tucker said. "But I am known in the district. I know the players." 
</P>
<P>
The heir apparent is 34, a tall, husky, bearded man with glasses. In an 
interview last week, he seemed comfortable with his new role in the limelight. 
He talked freely about the issue that may dominate the abbreviated campaign: 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"If they spend all their time making me an issue, fine," he said. "I'll be 
talking about the real issues: health, crime, airport noise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Brown's Puppet 
</P>
<P>
Of his critics and rival candidates -- who dismiss him as a puppet of Brown 
whose only credential is his name -- Tucker said: 
</P>
<P>
"They're discounting what I've done for the past six years, who I know, and how 
the real world works. It's sour grapes." 
</P>
<P>
Asserting that most people in politics have a mentor, he added: "They have to 
realize the nature of politics and remember how they got where they are." 
</P>
<P>
Rival candidate Lois Hill-Hale, an Inglewood school board member and former 
aide to state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), said voters will resent 
Brown's "big boss" tactics. She said she has never encountered Tucker during 10 
years of political work in Sacramento and in the 50th District. She said many 
voters do not know that the elder Tucker has died, and she predicted that her 
opponent would exploit that confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's going to keep as low a profile as possible and hope that as many 
as people as possible will not find out that his father has passed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker responded: "A lot of people have told me, don't use 'junior' on your 
name, don't change the color of your father's campaign signs, don't use your 
picture on literature. But I'm not trying to fool anybody. I'll always be 
junior." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow Father's Agenda 
</P>
<P>
Tucker promises to carry on his father's policies, particularly the careful 
attention to constituents that was the foundation of the assemblyman's 
strength, along with big war chests financed by the health industry and labor. 
Tucker says his legislative office will provide "one-stop" service for 
constituents who need help. He says his differences with his father are largely 
a matter of style, though he considers himself slightly more conservative on 
issues such as crime. 
</P>
<P>
"He favored capital punishment, but I'd be more likely to use it," he said. "I 
believe it's a deterrent, and I believe it's cheaper to throw the switch than 
to pay to keep someone in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's upbringing was steeped in politics. His family was known as "the 
Tucker army" because of their involvement in the career of their father, who 
was appointed Inglewood's first black councilman in 1972, was elected to the 
Assembly two years later and eventually became Health Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
As the third of five children and the only son of a "very strong" father, 
Tucker says he was restless and resisted his father's pressure to follow a 
rapid career path. Instead, he attended several colleges, finally earning a 
bachelor's degree in history from Cal State Dominguez Hills in 1980. He also 
worked in construction for Pacific Telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see what was out there," Tucker said. "I liked climbing poles and 
filling manholes. It gave me a different perspective on life. My father didn't 
like it, but he knew I'd eventually get tired of getting wet and dirty." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who is married and has two children, entered politics in 1983 as a 
legislative assistant based in Roos' 46th District field office. He acted as a 
liaison with community groups on several projects, according to people who 
worked with him, including a 1986 bill (AB 2700) to toughen penalties on 
apartment owners who did not cooperate with police against drug-dealing 
tenants. He also worked on preparing a 1987 bill (AB 1700) that provided 
incentives to the Los Angeles Unified School District to build multistory 
school buildings rather than tear down neighboring homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives the school board money to build more creatively on less land," Tucker 
said. "It suppresses the need of cutting further into housing stock." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praised Effort 
</P>
<P>
A legislative staffer who knows Tucker's work praised his efforts on that bill. 
"The school district was happy and the homeowners were happy," the staffer 
said. "I'd give Curtis an 'A' on that one." 
</P>
<P>
The staffer described Tucker as intelligent and capable. But Tucker's work 
sometimes suffered because of absenteeism and a seeming lack of motivation, the 
staffer said: "There was some concern about the quality of his work. . . . I 
think he has the chance to be an above-average assembly member. He has the 
intellect. The question is, does he have the drive, the fire in the belly?" 
</P>
<P>
Tucker responded: "I would say that's one person's opinion. Everyone is not 
going to thrilled with your performance. That goes without saying." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, George Allen, executive director of the Wilshire Chamber of 
Commerce on which Tucker served as Roos' representative, had nothing but 
praise. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding young man and a hard worker," Allen said. "I highly 
recommend him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Positioning for Future 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Tucker's early doubts about a future in politics, he said his move 
this year to Assemblywoman Moore's office was calculated to bring him closer to 
the 50th District and position him for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why his father did not hire him as an aide, Tucker said they both 
believed it was better they did not work in the same office for both political 
and personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"The press would have had a field day with it," he said. "One family member 
shouldn't work directly for another." 
</P>
<P>
But the family had a synchronized political agenda, Tucker said. Having turned 
70, Assemblyman Tucker intended his 1988-90 term to be his last; in 1990, the 
plan was for Curtis Jr. to take center stage. 
</P>
<P>
"My father always wanted to be mayor of Inglewood," Tucker said. "He would have 
run for mayor, and I would have run for Assembly in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
But the elder Tucker's death has "speeded up the process tremendously," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's sudden emergence appears to have frustrated the ambitions of potential 
rivals, such as Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent and Councilman Daniel Tabor, 
both of whom have carefully built their careers toward a run for the Assembly. 
Both have said Tucker is not entitled to the seat simply because of his name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Has He Paid His Dues?' 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity to select among a qualified field of candidates has been 
eliminated," Tabor said. Alluding to the predominantly black voter base in the 
district, he added: "The real question is, how well does the African-American 
community manage the process of preparing leaders for the future? You tell 
people to go out and pay dues. Has he paid his dues?" 
</P>
<P>
Tucker says he has. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no prerequisite course for being a member of the Assembly," he said. 
"There should be a need to serve and a desire to do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker hopes to win election Feb. 7 by capturing more than 50% of the vote, 
thus avoiding an April 11 runoff against Mike Davis, the only Republican 
running. Tucker says his campaign plans to spend between $100,000 and $150,000 
on the race and will use an adviser from Brown's Sacramento operation, as well 
as political consultant Parke Skelton, who ran the elder Tucker's last 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Tucker said he will follow his father's lead in giving special 
attention to health matters; he hopes to work on a comprehensive package of 
health-care legislation being prepared by Brown that will be named after the 
elder Tucker. He also said that although his father had a mild aversion to 
publicity, especially television, he plans to have a higher profile and use the 
media to report on what he is doing in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's opponents look forward to confronting him on equal footing at debates 
scheduled for next month. They say Tucker's advantage will crumble when voters 
compare the candidates in person. 
</P>
<P>
But Frank Lewis, an Inglewood dentist and longtime Tucker ally, said Tucker 
will live up to his father's legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's quiet," Lewis said. "But he knows politics. He's well-versed. People are 
going to be surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said: "So many people who go into politics have a puffed up sense of 
self-worth. My father never took himself seriously. . . . And I'm still the 
same person who hung off telephone poles. I have no illusions about who I am." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TUCKER ON RECORD 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't spent as much time in the (50th) district as I would have liked, but 
I am known in the district. I know the players." 
</P>
<P>
"(My critics) are discounting what I've done for the past six years, who I 
know, and how the real world works. It's sour grapes." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have told me, don't use 'junior' on your name, don't change 
the color of your father's campaign signs, don't use your picture on 
literature. But I'm not trying to fool anybody. I'll always be junior." 
</P>
<P>
"(My father) favored capital punishment, but I'd be more likely to use it. I 
believe it's a deterrent, and I believe it's cheaper to throw the switch than 
to pay to keep someone in jail." 
</P>
<P>
"My father always wanted to be mayor of Inglewood. He would have run for mayor, 
and I would have run for Assembly in 1990. (But the elder Tucker's death has 
"speeded up the process tremendously."

Officials of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles say they have been 
patient with Antonia Martin, but their patience has run out. 
</P>
<P>
They want the 59-year-old Torrance woman to pack her bags and leave the 
church-owned Torrance house where she has lived for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Martin says she can't afford to move. 
</P>
<P>
So on Jan. 11, the archdiocese will ask a South Bay Municipal Court judge to 
evict her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid No Rent 
</P>
<P>
The 600-square-foot wood-frame house at 20535 Anza Blvd. is on the grounds of 
St. James Catholic School, where Antonia's late husband, Angel, was a custodian 
from 1968 until his death in July of 1987. The church allowed the couple and 
their two daughters to live there rent-free while he worked at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he is gone, the church wants Antonia Martin out of the house so it can 
be used for school faculty meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who lives alone, contends that a priest at St. James Catholic Church in 
Redondo Beach, which runs the school, told her in November that she could stay 
until she could afford to move. Now, she said, church officials have gone back 
on their word. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that the church would be more sensitive toward me," said Martin, who 
came with her husband to the South Bay from Cuba in 1967. "I thought they would 
be more considerate." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who said she has a back ailment that prevents her from working, lives 
on $340-a-month disability checks. She said she can't find a suitable apartment 
that she can afford. 
</P>
<P>
"I would move if I could afford it," she said. "I just can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stay Until June 
</P>
<P>
Martin said she only wants to stay in the home until June, when she turns 60 
and becomes eligible for Social Security benefits. She said she does not know 
how much the payments will be, but she hopes the money will enable her to 
afford an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Blaney director of real estate for the archdiocese, said that if the 
priest -- who is on vacation and could not be reached -- did promise to let 
Martin stay, he did not mean she could stay until June, nearly two years after 
her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to give this house to her rent-free forever," he said. 
"Months have gone by, and we have had no indication that she has found or 
intends to find other housing." 
</P>
<P>
The church referred Martin to the Catholic Charities social service agency in 
Long Beach, but Lupe Macker the regional director, said Martin has "not been 
very cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
Macker said Martin was offered several housing options, including group housing 
for the elderly and care and board facilities, but none appealed to her. 
</P>
<P>
"She has not accepted the reality that she has to move," Macker said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said she wants to stay in the Torrance area and the housing offered by 
the agency was too far away or had other drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Todd, a paralegal working for the archdiocese, said the church has offered 
to allow Martin to stay in the home rent-free until Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"But that is our final offer," he said. "I think the church has been very 
lenient. There is no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Kirby, a Hermosa Beach attorney who has taken Martin's case, says 
Martin should be allowed to stay in the house until June because church 
officials told Martin "to take all the time you need." 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," Kirby said, "if the school has been without a meeting place for 20 
years, why can't they wait a few more months?" 
</P>
<P>
Kirby said Martin cannot find other housing because of her limited income. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to find an apartment for $340 a month and see how you do," she said. 
Martin has applied to several retirement homes, but they were too expensive or 
had long waiting lists, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said she does not want to seek help or move in with one of her two grown 
daughters, one in Lomita and one in Cerritos, because "they have their own 
lives, and I don't want to burden them." 
</P>
<P>
Both church officials and Martin said they are willing to negotiate. But if 
negotiations fail and the case goes to court, Martin said, "I just hope God's 
grace is with me."

FLORA OF THE VALLEY: COCKLEBURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cockleburs, a common plant in fields and riverbeds, along roadsides and near 
reservoirs, is easily recognized by its prickly burs. 
</P>
<P>
With numerous species, cockleburs are plentiful throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The most frequently seen in California are Xanthium strumarium and Xanthium 
spinosum. Xanthium is a Greek word meaning yellow and was the ancient name of a 
plant used to dye hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Although their origin is unknown, cockleburs are not considered native plants. 
Often pesky, they can develop solid stands on river flood plains covering many 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
Because each bur-like fruit contains two seeds that produces its own generation 
of offspring, cockleburs are difficult to eradicate once started. One of the 
seeds requires much more oxygen than the other and remains dormant for a year 
longer than its twin. Seeds are protected by airtight coats. 
</P>
<P>
Cockleburs are bushy plants that grow to about 3 feet tall. Their inconspicuous 
flowers are greenish and minute. 
</P>
<P>
The hairy, egg-shaped burs are about half-an-inch long and covered with hooked 
prickles that attach themselves to animal fur, manes and tails. 
</P>
<P>
The stems are covered with tiny hairs. The oval to wedge-shaped leaves are 
toothed and 2 to 5 inches long. They are thick in texture and usually are 
three-lobed. 
</P>
<P>
Cockleburs in the seedling stage are poisonous to animals. MAYERENE BARKER

TRAIN KILLS MAN PLAYING 'CHICKEN' IN OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Escondido man, who was apparently playing a game of dare with 
friends, was killed Friday night when he put his head on a railroad track and 
was struck by a southbound train passing through Oceanside, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn James Schultz, while playing a game of "chicken" with friends about 11 
p.m., laid down and placed his head on the tracks at Oceanside Boulevard, 
between Cleveland and Myers streets, Sgt. Reggie Grigsby said. 
</P>
<P>
He was struck and killed instantly by the Amtrak train bound for San Diego from 
Los Angeles, police said, adding that the train was traveling 30-40 m.p.h.

JIM MURRAY: 1988: IT WAS VINTAGE YEAR FOR LOSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hello 1989, I thought you'd never get here. 
</P>
<P>
1988? I thought you'd never leave. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, it was the Year of the Loser. In order, they were: 
</P>
<P>
1. Ben Johnson -- Oh, rare, Ben Johnson. How can anyone lose more devastatingly 
than at the very hour of achieving his life's ambition? When it all falls to 
ashes just after all one's dreams are realized, when the world is at his feet, 
when what you have worked for, strived for, dreamed of all your life has just 
come true -- and someone comes in and tells you it's all been a mistake. Ben 
had just won the Olympic gold medal, set the world record and identified 
himself as the greatest sprinter of all time when suddenly a man in a white lab 
coat turns it to nightmare. When they stripped Jim Thorpe of his medals, he 
became an object of pity. Ben Johnson became an object of scorn. He lost more 
than a medal. He lost respect. Ben makes loser-of-the-year unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
2. Dave Stieb -- Would you classify as a loser a pitcher who lost a no-hitter 
with two-out in the bottom on the ninth to a bad-hop single through the 
infield? OK, how about a pitcher who lost two no-hitters in a row that way? 
That, my friends, is major-league losing. Just a twist here and you're looking 
at the second guy in major-league history to pitch back-to-back no- hitters. 
You are looking at Johnny Vander Meer II. You are looking at a guy who will 
become the answer to a trivia question through 2000 A.D. Alas! The ball hopped. 
</P>
<P>
3. Pat Dye -- How do you become a loser-of-the-year when you have the ball on 
your opponents' 13-yard line, 3 points behind, with 4 seconds left to play? 
Right! You kick a field goal. A losers' play. You go for the tie. You strike 
your colors, fold your hand, cry uncle. It's what Auburn coach Pat Dye did in 
last year's Sugar Bowl against Syracuse. Whatever happened to "Winning isn't 
everything, it's the only thing?" Whatever became of Fight, fight, fight? 
Stonewall Jackson would never understand. Neither would George Gipp. Woody 
Hayes would hit somebody. 
</P>
<P>
4. Davey Johnson -- How would you like to be in Game 7 of the playoff series 
for the National League pennant and have a pitcher on your staff who is known 
as "Dr.K," who has struck out more than 1,000 batters, won 18 games in the 
season and is only 23 years old. He is on the bench with 3 days rest. The 
opposition is starting its best pitcher who has had only 3 days rest and has 
already pitched 3 times in the series. Nevertheless, Manager Davey Johnson 
doesn't start Dwight Gooden in the most important game of the season. The Mets 
manager starts Ron Darling with predictable results. He doesn't save Gooden 
anyway. Dwight gets in the game with the score 6-0 and the pennant gone. In the 
other dugout, Manager Tom Lasorda plays the ace -- Orel Hershiser. Davey 
Johnson makes loser-of-the-year by acclamation, the pinup boy for every 
second-guesser east of the Tehachapis. 
</P>
<P>
5. Dennis Eckersley -- How would you like to be the best relief pitcher in the 
American League with a league-leading 45 saves, an ERA of 2.35, a record of 
having only walked 11 batsmen all year and a record of having finished 53 of 
the 60 games you appeared -- and in the ninth inning of the first World Series 
game, you are breezing along with a 4-3 lead and have just retired the first 
two batters to face you, one by strikeout, the other by weak grounder. You need 
an out to, maybe, just clinch the whole World Series when up comes this batter 
who has hit just .196 all year with no great reputation for power (he has hit 2 
home runs and has 17 runs-batted-in). He strikes out a lot (once every 4 1/2 
times at-bat). 
</P>
<P>
This is not Babe Ruth but you, you, unaccountably, begin to pitch to him as if 
he were. The next thing you know, you have just walked Mike Davis and put the 
tying run on first base. But, never mind. Get a load of the guy who's coming up 
to pinch-hit. He looks like a guy leaving a train wreck. He can hardly walk. He 
winces just lifting the bat. He's only going to tap the ball into play some 
place and hope for a big break. This is the only at-bat he'll get in the whole 
Series and he doesn't look as if he can handle even this. You get two quick 
strikes on this refugee from the disabled list and this looks like a mismatch. 
The chances are good he couldn't get around on a medium-good fastball if you 
sent it up there with stamps on it. So, for some reasons best known to the 
gremlins of baseball, you decide to try what you call a "backdoor slider" on 
him. Now, the slider is the pitch the late Fresco Thompson used to say was 
going to put * lot of .270 hitters in the Hall of Fame. It was, he said, the 
pitch that let Maris break Babe Ruth's home-run record. 
</P>
<P>
It has been variously described as the "nickel curve," the "downtown pitch," 
and, when it doesn't work, as "the slop slider." This one you let go of is all 
three. At the bat, Kirk Gibson can't believe his good luck. His eyes get big, 
his groin doesn't hurt any more. He dreams of pitches like this. As Joe 
Garagiola would say, "you couldn't order a better one from room service." 
Gibson swings. Not hard, just about like a guy lofting a 9-iron to a trapped 
green. It is out of the lot the minute it leaves the bat. It is one of the 
historic home runs of baseball history. It wins, to all intents and purposes, 
the World Series. It is a pitch Dennis Eckersley probably wanted to run after 
and retrieve the minute he let go of it. To call time. Pray for an earthquake. 
Anything to get that ball back in his glove before it goes into the right-field 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
That pitch is one of the great losers of 1988. It is a game-loser and a 
Series-loser. They don't get any worse than that.

CHICAGO ROLLS PAST PHILADELPHIA AS FOG BLANKETS SOLDIER FIELD 
</P>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You just couldn't see the Chicago Bears beating the Philadelphia Eagles 
Saturday in their National Football Conference semifinal playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the Bears won, 20-12. You just couldn't see it. 
</P>
<P>
Or much of anything else on a day when fog, rolling in off Lake Michigan, 
severely hampered visibility at Soldier Field. Veterans in the press box said 
it was the worst they'd seen, or rather not seen, at this stadium in half a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows? When they review the film, they may yet discover Philadelphia won. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka vs. Buddy Ryan? This was more like Sherlock Holmes vs. Professor 
Moriarty. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, as is often the case at Soldier Field, blue sky or no sky, the 
game came down to the Bear defensive unit. Ranked No. 2 in the National 
Football League, it lived up to its ranking, intercepting 3 Randall Cunningham 
passes and holding the Eagles to 52 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
And the Eagles helped out by constantly breaking down offensively. Penalties, 
dropped passes, missed opportunities -- Philadelphia was guilty of all that as 
it failed to reach the end zone despite the fact that Cunningham completed 27 
of 54 passes for 407 yards. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the players couldn't even see the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"What I could see was about 20 yards downfield," Cunningham said. "If you take 
your 10-yard dropback, you could see only about 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to change to our short routes. They knew that. But let me say first, we 
beat ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
And much to the delight of the crowd of 65,534. Or at least that portion of the 
crowd that could see what was going on. Pity the poor fan who shelled out $30 
to sit in a seat and watch the blurry figures fade in and out of the mist. Kind 
of like paying for a big fight to be beamed into your living room only to have 
the picture go out on your television set. 
</P>
<P>
In the press box, the media were reduced to listening to reports from the field 
or watching monitors. 
</P>
<P>
How often do you hear the public address announcer say, "There's word of a flag 
on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Never mind instant replay. Saturday's game may begin a debate over the use of 
radar. 
</P>
<P>
It was a great day for getting away with holding, 12 men on the field or the 
hidden-ball trick. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been a great afternoon for legendary Bear runner Red Grange, 
known as the Galloping Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the home-field advantage. The fans can't cheer for what they can 
only hear. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely enough, the day began with a bright blue sky and the temperature in 
the 30s. 
</P>
<P>
It was under those conditions that the Bears took an early lead. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mike Tomczak, starting his first NFL playoff game, made his first 
completion a memorable one, connecting with Dennis McKinnon on a 64-yard 
touchdown pass play in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a problem with the coverage, and I think we might have had the right 
play called," Tomczak said. (Receiver Glen) Kozlowski cut underneath, and I 
think the corner (Roynell Young) was starting to move inside, apparently 
thinking Dennis was also going inside. Dennis just headed upfield and had the 
corner beat. It was a great fake on Dennis' part." 
</P>
<P>
It also helped that safety Andre Waters, the only man with a shot at McKinnon, 
fell down. 
</P>
<P>
He got up after McKinnon had caught the ball at the Philadelphia 40 and had a 
shot at the Bear receiver but missed the tackle, leaving McKinnon to celebrate 
the last 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Tomczak completed 10 of 20 for 172 yards before he was forced out in 
the third quarter on a play in which he had his third interception, this one to 
Terry Hoage. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie White hit Tomczak, reinjuring the left shoulder that Tomczak had 
separated several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McMahon, originally forced to the sideline with a twisted knee and then 
kept there by Tomczak's success as a starter, finished the game. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka, the Bear coach, said he would wait to see how severe Tomczak's injury is 
before naming a starter for next week's NFC championship game, where the Bears 
will play host to the winner of today's Minnesota Vikings-San Francisco 49ers 
game. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up the bomb to McKinnon, the Eagles responded with their own 
aerial attack. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, the sun was still out at this point, and the end zone was clearly in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond reach. 
</P>
<P>
On their first drive after the touchdown, the Eagles wound up with nothing when 
Luis Zendejas missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia got the ball back on the first play of the Bears' next drive on 
Seth Joyner's interception. 
</P>
<P>
Then came one of the Eagles' most frustrating drives of the season, exceeded 
only by its next drive. 
</P>
<P>
More about that later. 
</P>
<P>
Taking over at the Chicago 30, Philadelphia drove to the 9, where Cunningham 
hit Cris Carter with a pass in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent touchdown was called back because of illegal motion by running 
back Anthony Toney. 
</P>
<P>
So Cunningham came right back and fired it into the end zone again. This time, 
4 men touched the ball. Defenders Dave Duerson and Mike Richardson got a hand 
on it. Carter also got a piece, batting the ball into the arms of fellow 
receiver Mike Quick. 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown at last? 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. Again a penalty. Again Toney. This time holding. 
</P>
<P>
So the Eagles settled for Zendejas' 42-yard field goal. In all, he would kick 
4, the others coming from 29, 30 and 35 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' frustration, however, was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
On their next drive, they reached the Chicago 4, where they faced a fourth and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham kept the ball on a draw and was hit at the line by Dante Jones. 
</P>
<P>
The officials brought out the chains. And measured. And checked. And checked 
again. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict? 
</P>
<P>
Short by an inch. 
</P>
<P>
On their next drive, the Eagles again apparently had a touchdown in their 
grasp. Keith Jackson was wide open in the end zone, but he jumped too soon for 
Cunningham's perfect pass and dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago took the ensuing kickoff and drove to another touchdown, Neal Anderson 
going in from the Eagle 4 off left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
By now the fog rolled in, and the Eagles were ready to roll out of postseason 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears added 6 points on Kevin Butler's field goals of 46 and 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan, a former assistant at Chicago, where 
he had a long-running feud with Ditka, was asked if he had shaken hands with 
his former head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"What," he asked, "was there to shake about?" 
</P>
<P>
NFC Playoff Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago interceptions were by Mickey Pruitt, Vestee Jackson and Maurice 
Douglass. . . . Keith Jackson, despite his drop, had a big day receiving with 7 
catches for 142 yards. Running back Keith Byars made 9 catches for 103 yards. 
Byars was Philadelphia's leading ballcarrier with 34 yards in 7 carries. . . . 
Thomas Sanders led Chicago with 94 yards rushing, 58 coming on a second-quarter 
run.

Prior to this season, Geoff Courtnall, the Washington Capitals' hard-hitting, 
high-scoring left wing was mainly used as a checker and a guy who would give up 
his body to go into the boards and create havoc with opposing players. If he 
scored, all well and good, but his main job was disturbing the other team's 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
This year all of that has changed and Courtnall is the leading scorer on the 
Capitals and one of the driving offensive forces in the team's surge for first 
place in the Patrick Division of the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
"My job in the past was to go after the other guy," said Courtnall, who has 19 
goals and 19 assists entering Tuesday night's game at the Capital Centre at 
Landover, Md., against the Philadelphia Flyers. "My concern was not scoring, 
but stirring things up. I like it much better this year. I like being involved 
in the scoring. I always had a good shot and I always believed I could score, 
but that wasn't my primary role. I did what I was supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
In his previous five seasons with the Boston Bruins, Courtnall, 6-feet-1, 
195-pound, a native of Victoria, British Columbia, scored 82 goals and handed 
out 85 assists in 271 games. Last season, one which he split between Boston and 
Edmonton, was his best scoring year with 36 goals and 30 assists. Barring 
serious injury, he should easily surpass both figures this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals acquired Courtnall, 26, from Edmonton for Greg Adams last July. 
</P>
<P>
"Geoff Courtnall has added a new dimension to our power play and has been our 
most consistent scorer," said Capitals Coach Bryan Murray. "He is a very aware 
hockey player. He sees so much of the ice. Not only is he a very adept passer, 
but he has a tremendous shot. He really has a gun as he has demonstrated on 
many occasions this season. He has been a very welcome addition to our hockey 
club." 
</P>
<P>
Courtnall, whose twin brother Russ plays for the Montreal Canadiens, leads the 
Capitals in home scoring with 12 goals and 10 assists and had the second 
longest scoring streak in team history when he scored in 15 consecutive games 
earlier this season. He leads the team in shots with 120 and collected his 
200th National Hockey League point Dec. 7 against the New Jersey Devils. He 
also has nine power-play goals. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, in his eighth season with Washington, achieved his 300th NHL coaching 
victory Dec. 15. He has coached 581 games and is tied with Tommy Ivan for 16th 
on the all-time victory list. Ivan coached Detroit and Chicago from 1947 until 
1958. 
</P>
<P>
Voting for the teams that will compete in the 40th NHL All-Star game Feb. 7 in 
Edmonton, Alberta, will end Sunday. Voting began in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Wales conference All-Stars will be coached by Terry O'Reilly of the Boston 
Bruins and the Campbell conference team will be coached by Glen Sather of the 
Edmonton Oilers. Norm Ullman and Bruce MacGregor, both former NHL players, have 
been named honorary captains for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford wing Sylvain Turgeon underwent surgery on a separated left shoulder 
Thursday and will be sidelined for three months. The Whalers recalled Dallas 
Gaume from Binghamton of the American Hockey League to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Where are they now? Reggie Leach, who scored the most goals in a season (61 in 
1976) for the Philadelphia Flyers and played 13 seasons with the Flyers, 
Boston, California and Detroit. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1976 when the 
Flyers won the Stanley Cup by beating Montreal, 4-0. He scored 666 points in 
934 games, including 381 goals. Leach owns Sports Lawn Service in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey fans in Pittsburgh have missed Wayne Gretzky two years in a row. Last 
season, when he was with Edmonton, he missed the Oilers' only game in 
Pittsburgh because of an injury, and this season he missed the Kings' only game 
in Pittsburgh because of his grandmother's funeral. Gretzky said that his 
grandmother, Mary Gretzky, used to sit in a chair and play goalie for him when 
he practiced his shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Petr Klima of the Detroit Red Wings has been going through some highs and lows 
lately. Last week, he went to the airport to meet his parents, Josef and Kveta 
Klima, for a reunion. He had not seen them since he defected from 
Czechoslovakia in August 1985. The next day, he was in court, pleading guilty 
to a drunken driving charge and leaving an accident scene. It was his second 
conviction.

SPORTS COLD WAR IS BEGINNING TO THAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider it a positive development in international relations that the Soviets 
have become frequent tourists. Familiarity has diluted contempt. Alas, it also 
has dulled the expectations of such meetings. 
</P>
<P>
When Mikhail Gorbachev stepped out of a limousine to shake hands with U.S. 
citizens during his recent visit, he followed the inclination of his nation's 
athletes. For more than a decade, they have enjoyed North American hospitality 
in increasing numbers. Until the advent of glasnost, they just lacked the 
freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is as much interest, if not more, in what they say as in the way they 
play. When the Central Red Army team meets the New York Islanders at Nassau 
Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., Thursday night, the focus will be on defenseman 
Vyatcheslav Fetisov, not only because he may be the best in the world at what 
he does, but also because he has made public his frustration in being prevented 
from joining the New Jersey Devils. "If it weren't for Gorbachev," he said 
Wednesday, "this (discussion) would be impossible." 
</P>
<P>
But the sports exchanges between East and West preceded the improved dialogue 
between government officials. This marks the seventh tour of NHL rinks by one 
or more Soviet clubs in the last 13 years, and that doesn't include such 
special events as the Challenge Cup, the Canada Cup or the Rendez-Vous '87 
series. And hockey is merely the tip of the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Soviet teams have competed in basketball, volleyball, boxing, 
wrestling and, yes, even baseball on U.S. soil. The U.S.S.R. has sent us 
wrestlers and weightlifters, among others, in the past. A decade ago, it even 
entered a team in World Team Tennis. The team wasn't very good, but it was the 
only one in the league that managed to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
And now we have in our midst the Red Army team and Dynamo Riga team, which 
played the second game on a western swing Wednesday night in Edmonton, Alberta. 
The NHL is billing it as a Super Series, but it's more superfluous than 
anything. We have passed the point where either side has much to prove in terms 
of superiority. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the case in 1972, of course. The Soviets were regarded as amateurs 
(in the most derisive sense of the word) by the Canadian hockey establishment 
when the NHL agreed to make available its seasoned pros in an eight-game hockey 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
Officials laughed at the Soviets' equipment before the first game at the 
Montreal Forum, and at least one newspaper columnist promised to eat his words 
if Team Canada lost as much as one game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our first training camp," Islanders President Bill Torrey recalled 
Wednesday. "We watched the game at the beautiful Holiday Inn in Peterborough 
(Ontario). We went up 2-0 and everyone was saying this is going to be a piece 
of cake." 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviets stormed back to win the first game in a rout, and the NHL's 
best didn't clinch a 4-3-1 series victory until the final minute of the final 
game, played in Moscow. "That was my last year of midgets," said Bryan 
Trottier, then a 16-year-old in rural Saskatchewan. "I remember the last game 
was on at 11 o'clock. The whole school shut down and we all went to the 
auditorium to watch it on television." 
</P>
<P>
The drama, intensified by the belief that the teams were upholding a way of 
life, was riveting. And the lack of previous contact between the groups led to 
suspicion. There was the story of Wayne Cashman, who, convinced his hotel room 
in Moscow was bugged, located a foreign-looking object underneath the carpet 
and proceeded to unscrew it, sending a chandelier in the room below toppling to 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
From a sporting standpoint, the cold war between East and West ended on the ice 
in Moscow. The World Hockey Association sent a team of all-stars to Moscow two 
years later and, in 1976, the Soviets sent two club teams to tour North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening before the Red Army made its initial appearance at the Coliseum 
almost 13 years ago, Islanders owner Roy Boe hosted a reception for the 
visitors. "If you want plenty of beer or vodka," he said, "we'll do what we can 
to help." 
</P>
<P>
North American teams have since gone beyond providing alcohol for the visitors. 
Last summer, the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association 
worked to rehabilitate the Achilles injury that had sidelined Soviet center 
Arvidas Sabonis. He returned from the injury in time to lead his country to an 
upset of the U.S. team in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Such consideration didn't make everyone in the United States happy. John 
Thompson, for one, was critical of Americans giving aid to the enemy even 
before the team he coached was ambushed in Seoul, South Korea. But, as the 
Trail Blazers explained, they were only protecting their own investment. They 
had drafted Sabonis and were hopeful that he would be permitted to wear a 
Portland uniform after the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
They're still waiting, as are the Devils for Fetisov. Many on both sides 
believe it's inevitable that individual Soviet athletes will be permitted to 
play for professional teams in North America, further blurring the distinctions 
in lifestyle that once gave such bite to games between the East and West. 
</P>
<P>
"In the actual situation of world extension, of the relationship between our 
countries," Soviet forward Igor Larionov said Wednesday through an interpreter, 
"it's a good step." Larionov has been drafted by the Vancouver Canucks. Is he 
interested in playing here? "Why not?" he replied, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps some day there will be Soviets sprinkled throughout the NHL, the NBA 
and other professional leagues. And perhaps at such a time the presence of even 
the leader of the U.S.S.R. won't halt traffic in New York.

DYNAMO RIGA PROVES TOO MUCH FOR KINGS, 'COACH' MCNALL, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owner Bruce McNall was behind the Kings' bench for the game against the Soviet 
team Saturday night, wearing a sweater proclaiming him, "Coach." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, when they presented him with the chance to coach the team in this 
exhibition game, they expected it to be a pleasant experience. The Kings were 
supposed to beat Dynamo Riga. 
</P>
<P>
The big surprise was that Dynamo Riga defeated the Kings, 5-3, before a crowd 
of 11,490 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches wanted me to see what it was like behind the bench," McNall said. 
"I found out that it's confusing. It's upsetting. I don't know how they do it. 
. . . It was interesting. But I guess I did something wrong. Anyway, they told 
me that's the last time I coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty humiliating for me to be canned after my coaching debut." 
</P>
<P>
It was pretty humiliating for the Kings to lose to Dynamo Riga, a young team 
that was playing its fourth game in 5 days after traveling from Calgary to 
Edmonton to Vancouver to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dynamo Riga, the weaker of the two Soviet teams making a tour of the National 
Hockey League, had been losing ground with every game. The visitors opened with 
a 2-2 tie at Calgary, lost at Edmonton, 2-1, then lost at Vancouver, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
But against the Kings, they jumped out to a 5-1 lead before Wayne McBean and 
Wayne Gretzky narrowed the gap with third-period goals. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Robbie Ftorek of the Kings said: "We weren't trying to make light of this 
game by asking Bruce to coach, but we thought it would be a good time to let 
him see what happens during a game. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have given the impression that this game was not important to us, but 
it's only not important until you step on the ice. Then you want to win. 
</P>
<P>
"We have three big (Smythe Division) games coming up, and we wanted to play 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the third period, we asked the guys to go out and try to win the period 
to put us in a good frame of mind for going to Calgary, and they did that," 
Ftorek said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings won the final period, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
But that was after the Soviets won the first, 2-1, and the second, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Dynamo Riga Coach Vladimir Yurzinov said: "I am satisfied with how my team 
played tonight. It was a very important game for our team from a psychological 
point of view. If we had lost this game, it would have put us in a difficult 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the difference between the 2 teams, Yurzinov said: "The L.A. Kings 
were not fast tonight. The difference in their speed and ours was just about 
the same difference as between us and Vancouver." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets struck for 2 quick goals in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
On the first goal, Anatoli Semenov put his stick on the ice to deflect a pass, 
which sent the puck flying over goalie Mark Fitzpatrick's left shoulder at 
14:38. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei Lomakin got an unassisted goal at 15:31 when Fitzpatrick apparently 
thought he had made the stop, but the puck had another couple of inches of 
momentum. It glanced off his stick and into the corner of the goal . 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls scored the first goal for the Kings at 16:26 of the first 
period, a wrist shot from the left circle. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets took a 3-1 lead in the second period, taking advantage of the power 
play after Mike Krushelnyski was called for hooking. Sergei Selyanin lifted a 
left-handed slap shot over the outstretched glove of Fitzpatrick at 6:47. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets went ahead, 4-1, when Alexi Frolikov picked up a loose puck, turned 
and fired from 40 feet away. Dynamo Riga made it 5-1 when Alexander Smirnov 
sent the puck from the blue line, through traffic, and past Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Left wing Bob Carpenter of the Kings suffered a bruised right wrist early in 
the third period and was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center for X-rays.

MORNING BRIEFING: SOME WINNING QUOTATIONS FROM 1988 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Happy New Year. Here are some selected one-liners from 1988: 
</P>
<P>
 Frank King, chairman of the Calgary Winter Olympics organizing committee: 
"Wherever I go, people are waving at me. Maybe if I do a good job, they'll use 
all their fingers." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Valvano, North Carolina State basketball coach and athletic director, on 
college administrators: "Monday through Friday, they want you to be like 
Harvard. On Saturday, they want you to play like Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
Julius Erving, on Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers: "When Charles 
first came into the league, his body proportions were out of whack. He looked 
more like Dom DeLuise. Now he looks like Michelangelo's statue David. The only 
thing that is fat now is his head." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino, to a woman who saw him washing the windows at his home and asked 
him how much he charged: "Lady, the woman in this house lets me sleep with 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Martin, asked if he had a drinking problem: "The only problem is that you 
run into a guy who's a banker in the afternoon and thinks he's King Kong at 
night. If one of those guys tries something with me, I'll drop him." 
</P>
<P>
Golfer JoAnne Carner, crediting Martin with teaching her how to win: "The only 
thing I never learned from Billy Martin was how to knock a guy out in a bar." 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Mike Scott of the Houston Astros, after the attendance figure of 1938 
was put on the scoreboard in Atlanta: "I didn't know if that was the attendance 
or the year Nolan Ryan was born." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manger Tom Lasorda, asked by Chicago reporters how fast Don Sutton was 
pitching: "We had him clocked at 92 -- 45 going to Rick Dempsey and 47 coming 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Thompson of Georgetown, on the criticism he's received: "It doesn't 
bother me. The more I'm criticized, the more my speaking fee goes up." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rodman of the Detroit Pistons, asked if he would kiss Magic Johnson on 
the cheek as Isiah Thomas did: "I think we should get engaged first." 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Jackie Mason, claiming Michael Spinks didn't train properly for Mike 
Tyson: "He should have taken voice lessons, so he could have yelled for help." 
</P>
<P>
CBS announcer Jim Nantz, at a roast for Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson: "The only 
time Jimmy didn't run up the score was 27 years ago, when he took the SAT." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Lou Holtz of Notre Dame, on his youth: "You hear people talking about an 
inferiority complex. Me, I didn't have a complex. I was inferior." 
</P>
<P>
David Letterman: "Baseball was an exhibition sport in the Olympics this year -- 
sort of like it was in Baltimore." 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher of the Dodgers, on Kirk Gibson's ninth-inning home run in Game 1 
of the World Series: "I wanted to go out and kiss the guy, but he never 
shaves." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's Jose Canseco, on Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser: "I'm going to hire 
him as my personal hitting coach." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Fertig, former USC quarterback and assistant coach who is the new 
associate athletic director at UC Irvine: "There's a rumor we're going to start 
playing football. The first call I get is from Terry Donahue. He wants to 
schedule us." 
</P>
<P>
Lou Holtz, asked the effect the suspension of two players for being late to a 
team meal had on the team's punctuality: "At the next pregame meal, our guys 
came and watched them prepare it."

STRUGGLING BILLS MAY HAVE THEIR DIFFICULTIES AGAINST THOSE ORNERY OILERS 
</P>

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Houston Oilers are coming, the Houston Oilers are coming. 
</P>
<P>
America's incorrigibles are on the road again, their reputations preceding 
them, threatening another hometown darling. Today it's the Buffalo Bills, 
playing their first playoff game at home in 22 years before their wild, crazy, 
longest-suffering, ready-to-party-hearty fans. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills are 3 1/2-point favorites, although a look at their recent record 
makes you wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Meet the Paper Bills? 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo had the league's best record -- 11-1 -- until losing 3 of its last 4. 
The Bills were outrushed in the losses, 232 to 110 yards, 110-39 and 53-19, an 
ominous sign for a conservative team. Also, Shane Conlan, the inside linebacker 
who was a key to their rushing defense until he missed all of the late losses, 
is expected to sit out again; quarterback Jim Kelly is under increasing fire, 
and some of it is coming from a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
That's halfback Robb Riddick, who recently told a TV station in Rochester, 
N.Y., "I just don't feel Jim is doing the job he is being paid to do." 
</P>
<P>
Riddick was upset that the backs weren't being thrown enough passes, although 
you have to wonder which games he has been watching. More than one-third of 
Kelly's completions have gone to his backs. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Marv Levy was upset with the timing of the remarks and said there was 
nothing to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Robb came back and called Jim Kelly that night," Levy said. "He told him the 
remarks came out much different than he'd expected and apologized for whatever 
embarrassment there was. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim said, 'Forget it, I know how these things happen, we've got more important 
things to deal with than that.' " 
</P>
<P>
That Kelly is a brick, isn't he? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he may have been a tiny bit more perturbed than Levy said he was. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly is generally considered one of the game's best young quarterbacks, has 
just made the Pro Bowl over such candidates as Dan Marino and John Elway . . . 
and has been getting ripped in letters to the editor and on radio talk shows by 
the arch-supportive Bills faithful. There's a reason for it too -- try 15 
touchdown passes against 17 interceptions, compared to the 41-28 ratio he 
compiled in his first 2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Irony: As he starts to get his greatest praise since entering the league, he's 
drawing his most heat, too. 
</P>
<P>
Bottom line: He's getting angry about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so tired of hearing about negative things," he said last week, when the 
Riddick question came up. 
</P>
<P>
But hadn't Riddick called to apologize, etc.? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Kelly, without enthusiasm, "he called." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Bills still have Bruce Smith (11 sacks in 12 games), 
Cornelius Bennett (9 1/2), Fred Smerlas and the rest of that rock-ribbed 
defense that got them here. The Oilers, renowned, warm-weather warriors, will 
face a more forbidding day than they got last week at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills are already braced for all of those Oiler tough-guy tactics, vowing 
not to retaliate, as the Browns' Ernest Byner did, earning back-to-back 
roughing penalties and killing a drive. However, you might conclude that the 
Oilers' Raider-type reputation is already working for them: the Bills are 
spending all this time worrying about what the Oilers will do and how they'll 
handle it. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Oilers have been on their best behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Glanville, fresh from eliminating the Browns and bringing down their 
coaching staff, took it easy on Buffalo, where he was an assistant 1 season. He 
said nothing bad about the town, which has provided fertile material for so 
many comedians, except to remark that he was leaving tickets for the late Jay 
Silverheels, the local actor who used to play Tonto. 
</P>
<P>
For a change, the most hated Oiler isn't their macho little coach but General 
Manager Ladd Herzeg. It was Herzeg who, in 1987, was accused of having made an, 
uh, impolite gesture during an argument at the team's hotel with members of a 
wedding party. 
</P>
<P>
Assault charges were filed against Herzeg but dropped by a Buffalo judge, on 
the condition that Herzeg stays out of local trouble. 
</P>
<P>
If those wedding receptions quit hassling him, he'll be fine. 
</P>
<P>
AFC Playoff Notes 
</P>
<P>
Come Back, Shane: the Bills sent Shane Conlan to Birmingham, Ala., last week to 
have Dr. James Andrews look at his injured arch which isn't responding to rest 
or therapy. Said Coach Marv Levy: "We're not counting on him, but we haven't 
counted him out." . . . Classic confrontation: Houston's offensive line, with 
its three, high No. 1 picks (Pro Bowl guards Bruce Matthews and Mike Munchak, 
and tackle Dean Steinkuhler) against the Bills' defensive front, which has four 
No. 1s (Pro Bowl players Bruce Smith, Cornelius Bennett, Conlan and Art Still) 
and two No. 2s (Pro Bowl player Fred Smerlas and Darryl Talley). . . . Key 
matchup, or Battle of the Bruces: Oiler left tackle Bruce Davis, the former 
Raider, vs. Bill right end Bruce Smith, second only to the Eagles' Reggie White 
in potential to disable an entire offense by himself. Smerlas, the colorful 
nose tackle, faces center Jay Pennison, who the Raiders considered the Oiler 
line's weak link. Of course, the Raiders thought Smerlas was a hype, too. . . . 
The Bills are 11-1 when they have rushed for more than 100 yards. However, the 
underrated Oiler defense was No. 1 in the American Football Conference against 
the run. . . . Levy, on defensing the Oilers: "They're not one dimensional. 
There's no one thing to stop. We can't say something like, 'Stop Eric Dickerson 
and you'll stop the Colts. It's not that simple. They have a superior offensive 
line, great receivers, a fine quarterback (Warren Moon) who gets better all the 
time and that tremendous stable of runners."

IT HAS BEEN QUITE A REIGN FOR DUKE; 
</P>
<P>
BIG TEN COMMISSIONER WILL RETIRE WHEN A REPLACEMENT IS CHOSEN 
</P>

One of Wayne Duke's most prized possessions is the clipping from Sports 
Illustrated that pictures him with John Wayne at the Rose parade. John Wayne 
sent him the clipping and signed it, "To Wayne Duke from Duke Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Duke, commissioner of the Big Ten, smiles when he tells about that 
now-fading momento. 
</P>
<P>
So you see, Duke does have some fond memories of the annual trip he has made to 
California for the Rose Bowl every year for the past 18 years. But ask him 
about the highlights and lowlights of his New Year's Day ritual and he gives 
that familiar Wayne Duke grimace. 
</P>
<P>
He had been in town less than 3 hours Wednesday and he had already been asked 
why the Big Ten can't win the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Since announcing his retirement last summer, a retirement that will become 
effective in the upcoming year when a successor is chosen, Duke has had plenty 
of opportunities to review his tenure as leader of the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
The conference boasts the largest football and basketball attendance in the 
country, and that comes from winning a lot of games. 
</P>
<P>
Duke was chairman of the NCAA basketball tournament committee that expanded the 
field to 64 teams and upped the TV rights so that the tournament now brings in 
about $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
Duke was on the committee that put together a $103 million TV package between 
the Big Ten and the Rose Bowl that will run through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl game is truly dear to his heart. Duke has always been able to 
refer to the game as "the granddaddy of them all" without cracking a smile at 
the corny sound. He believes it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a traditional matchup, and Duke believes that college football should be 
more traditional, should match schools and school spirits for the pride and the 
memories and the glory, not an abstract No. 1 and No. 2 for a mythical title. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have a 'national championship' game in Phoenix this year, or, from 
time to time, in Miami, but this game will be sold out year after year after 
year," Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl is his kind of college football. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Byers, the longtime executive director of the NCAA, now retired, who 
strongly influenced Duke during his early years in the NCAA office, told the 
Chicago Tribune: "We both came from the romantic era in sports. Emphasis was 
placed on values to be learned from the game. You competed because you enjoyed 
it." 
</P>
<P>
While he can get quite philosophical about the over-emphasis on winning and 
losing, even at the level of eighth-grade soccer his grandson plays, Duke 
cannot deny the impact it has on him to have to see his teams lose. 
</P>
<P>
"I go in the dressing rooms," Duke said. "I try to go to our team's dressing 
room after any game I see in the conference. I always go down after the Rose 
Bowl game. And there's a disappointment in there after a loss. People who are 
critical of our bowl record, or even people who are critical of the team's 
performance that day, don't have to see, first hand, the terrible 
disappointment that is felt by the players and the coaches who have put so much 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy up in the stands who has been tailgating all day and who thinks he has 
all the answers, doesn't have to see what losing does to the players and the 
coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Or what it does to Duke, who has come back up to the pressbox looking so 
distressed that writers have joked about keeping an eye on him so he doesn't 
jump from the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Duke tries to keep smiling. "Tom Hansen (commissioner of the Pacific 10) tells 
me I'm a very good loser," Duke said. "I tell him, that's because I've had a 
lot of practice." 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't get easier. 
</P>
<P>
As he flipped through the pages of his memories, Duke could not seem to 
separate good times and bad times in Southern California from the wins and the 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you the contrast," Duke said. "The first year we were here and 
something that happened just last year make a good contrast." 
</P>
<P>
The first year Duke and his wife, Martha, came out for the Rose Bowl game, 
Stanford beat Michigan. It was after the 1971 season. 
</P>
<P>
For the Duke family, it was an emotional time, anyway. He had become Big Ten 
commissioner on Sept. 1, 1971, after 8 years as commissioner of the Big Eight 
and 11 years of service in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. office. They 
had just sold their home of 19 years to make the move to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
After all those years of going to Miami every holiday season for the Orange 
Bowl, they were in Southern California -- where it was raining. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan team was having to practice in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was looking too rosy. 
</P>
<P>
And then, the all-important game. In the final minutes of the game, Michigan 
got a safety to go ahead of Stanford, 12-10. But Don Bunce, the Stanford 
quarterback, took Stanford down the field and Rod Garcia kicked a field goal to 
beat the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
"Martha and I had been talking about how the final standings would go if 
Michigan lost, and we knew that Big Eight teams were going to be 1-2-3," Duke 
said. "We'd been talking about that for days. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Lawrence Welk was grand marshal of the parade that year, and he was at 
the Tournament House that night for the party. He stood up there and said, 'A-1 
and a-2 and a-3,' and Martha burst into tears." 
</P>
<P>
Not a happy memory. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes decided in subsequent years to skip the party at the Tournament 
House. It was a celebration. Often the Big Ten contingent didn't feel like 
celebrating. The Dukes would go back to the presidential suite at the Pasadena 
Hilton to spend the evening with Big Ten guests. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, when Michigan State beat USC, they again skipped the Tournament 
House celebration. It wouldn't look right to show up only after a victory. 
</P>
<P>
So the Dukes were back in their suite that evening, savoring a victory that, 
admittedly, was a "blue collar win . . . a game we won after USC fumbled, but 
we'd lost a lot of games that way" when there was a knock at the door. 
</P>
<P>
"All the Rose Bowl officers -- Harriman Cronk and all the rest -- came to bring 
me my Rose Bowl watch," Duke said. "That was a highlight. They left their 
celebration to bring that to me, and I appreciated that." 
</P>
<P>
There were some points in their long relationship when some of the Rose Bowl 
folks were not too happy with Duke, when he sided with the movement to exclude 
the exclusivity clause from the Rose Bowl contract. 
</P>
<P>
Some feared that allowing Big Ten and Pac-10 teams to compete in other bowls, 
also, would dilute the impact of the Rose Bowl. Duke believed that the Rose 
Bowl, matching the champions of the conferences, would remain as strong as ever 
while letting more teams compete would be of benefit to both conferences. 
</P>
<P>
He was right, as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, Big Ten and Pac-10 schools have claimed an average of 
40% of the total bowl pot of about $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Duke points out that opening opportunities was good for parity in his 
conference, good for attendance, good for recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had just been named commissioner of the Big Eight, and I was only 34 
years old at the time, one of the first things I faced was the news that the 
Orange Bowl was terminating our exclusive contract," Duke said. "They wanted to 
be able to invite the top teams, to have a 'national championship' game. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports Illustrated wrote that the loss of that contract would be the death 
knoll of the Big Eight. Actually, it turned out to be a boon to the Big Eight. 
It opened up vistas for other bowls. We went to the Cotton Bowl, the Sugar Bowl 
and the Orange Bowl. It was great for our conference." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Rose Bowl changed its policy, and the Big Ten started to compete in 
other bowls in 1976, Big Ten schools have taken 56 bowl berths. 
</P>
<P>
Duke and his wife have been at a bowl game on New Year's Day for the last 26 
years. They might attend a bowl game just for fun next year. Or they might not. 
</P>
<P>
If he's not at the Rose Bowl next year, he says he'll miss it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to most of the bowl games at one time or another," Duke said. "I've 
been to all the major bowls -- Orange, Cotton, Sugar. . . . And this is not to 
degrade any of the others. But I think the Rose Bowl is special."

FOOTBALL GIVES OKLAHOMA BLACK EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a proposal for the governor of Oklahoma, the honorable Henry Bellmon. 
Roll up your sleeves, take a broom from the maintenance shed and, in one quick 
motion, sweep out the entire administration of the state university ... 
specifically the interim president, athletic director and football coach. Not 
under the rug, but out the door. 
</P>
<P>
It's particularly distressing that violations of recruiting rules have once 
again brought deep embarrassment to the school, its faculty and proud alumni. 
The University of Oklahoma has been slapped with a three-year probation for 
blatant disregard of the NCAA code. Too bad. 
</P>
<P>
There's something wrong in the thought process when Oklahoma puts such an 
emphasis on winning football games that it pays $1,000 to an athlete and 
provides an individual scalping service for varsity players so they can 
conveniently pocket the ticket money. If the governor isn't ashamed, then he's 
not conversant with what's going on in the state that elected him to provide 
proper guidance and supervision. 
</P>
<P>
It's personally distressing because we never met a man (or woman) from Oklahoma 
we didn't like. We once hitch-hiked from Tulsa to Claremore to visit the Will 
Rogers Museum in an effort to learn more about the old rope-spinning, 
yarn-telling cowboy philosopher. Our interest in Oklahoma has been so extensive 
that it resulted in the state's officially confirming upon us the title of 
"Honorary Okie," with an actual certificate and button to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
Now Oklahoma, in a football way, has gone and inflicted injury to itself by 
drawing still another suspension. This is the fourth time the football program 
has been penalized in as many decades. How much longer is this type of 
despicable conduct going to continue? 
</P>
<P>
The violation shows Oklahoma has found still another way to disgrace itself. 
It's also reminiscent of what the former OU president, speaking facetiously, 
once said: "We're going to build a university the football team can be proud 
of." Humorous or not, it's disgusting that education at Oklahoma is besmirched 
by what's going on in the hunt for prospects who can block and tackle. 
</P>
<P>
As for Coach Barry Switzer, the NCAA statement declared he "failed to exercise 
supervisory control." It's as though he went out to lunch and stayed when the 
problems were occurring. The duty to conduct a clean operation belongs to him. 
If his assistants and office help were involved in illegal tactics, then he is 
the one who should be compelled to pay the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
If it was the military and something such as this happened, then the duty 
officer in charge would be brought up on allegations of incompetency and maybe 
even stripped of his commission. Switzer should be taking the rap for what has 
happened. How can he be held blameless? 
</P>
<P>
The governor should ask for his resignation by nightfall and advise him to take 
his services to Texas A&amp;M, Houston or SMU. The assessment of the charges, 
bringing severe discipline, tells the public Switzer doesn't know what's going 
on in his own shop, or coaching offices. It's time to assess Barry's value to 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
It would be within the bounds of the governor's authority to suggest Switzer 
clean out his desk and be off the parking lot before the band strikes up the 
refrain of "Bye-Bye, Barry." It's obvious the transgressions need to be 
addressed from the governor's office and dealt with expeditiously. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma has been thrown for a severe loss. And what did the president, David 
Swank, who has the role on a temporary basis, say about it? He reacted by 
disclosing the university could lose between $750,000 and $1 million in each of 
the next two seasons. Athletic Director Donnie Duncan said, "I think the way of 
summing up the way I feel is they wanted us and they got us." 
</P>
<P>
This is a play for sympathy, trying to paint a picture of the NCAA 
investigators as being biased against the Sooners. That's a cop-out. When one 
of the dominant football-playing universities in the land puts itself in this 
position, how can it permit the man it pays to head its football show to open 
his arms and say he didn't know what the men and women he hired were doing? 
</P>
<P>
There has to be a line of responsibility somewhere. And the man out in front 
leading the entire effort is the head coach, Switzer. Does he walk away while 
two assistant coaches, Mike Jones and Scott Hill, and a recruiting coordinator, 
Shirley Vaughan, who was removed from her job, are painted as scapegoats and 
burned at the goal post? 
</P>
<P>
Switzer is an adult and has been at Oklahoma for 16 years. He knows the burden 
is on his shoulders. The university should consider terminating his contract 
and suspending football for the next five years. This would demonstrate good 
faith and do wonders for reclaiming the clean and ethical reputation Oklahoma 
deserves to have.

<P>
Alabama may have defeated Northeast Louisiana, but the Crimson Tide took a 
beating off the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
Thieves broke into Bryant Hall, the school's athletic dormitory, before 
Thursday night's game and stole about $2,000 worth of property belonging to 4 
Alabama players, campus police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Mark Shockley of the University Police Department said the thieves entered 
two rooms Thursday between 6 and 7 p.m., just before the beginning of the 
Crimson Tide's 80-65 victory over Northeast Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some electronic items stolen, some clothes, shoes and items of that 
nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Wimp Sanderson said the thieves stole a television and video cassette 
recorder belonging to freshman Robert Horry. Another freshman, Marcus Webb, 
lost a gold watch and other items. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the guys lost clothes," Sanderson told the Tuscaloosa News. "Some lost 
just about everything they had." 
</P>
<P>
Shockley said Bryant Hall "appeared to have been open" at the time of the 
heist. "The rooms which they entered also appear to have been open," he added. 
"Some other rooms appear to have been tampered with but we are not sure about 
that at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson said the thieves "had to be . . . fairly familiar with the dorm. They 
would seem to have known where the basketball players live, when they would 
have been out of the dorm and they knew the football players and some of the 
staff were out of town for Christmas. The basketball players were the only ones 
who would have had things there." 
</P>
<P>
University police are investigating the crime, and Sanderson also is trying to 
help recover some of the stolen items. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is anyone out there who knows how to help these guys get their things 
back, then I will post a reward," the coach said. "We would really just like to 
recover their property."

STEVE PATE RETURNING TO SAN DIEGO AREA -- ONE OF HIS FAVORITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mal Florence 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's understandable if Steve Pate is partial to the San Diego area. The PGA 
Tour was in its early stages last year and he had already won two tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
The former UCLA All-American won the MONY Tournament of Champions at La Costa 
followed by a victory in the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open, formerly known as the 
San Diego Open. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal last year was to win twice and I did it in San Diego, so I'd have to 
say it's been a pretty good area for me," Pate said. 
</P>
<P>
Pate would, of course, like the new year to be as rewarding as 1988. Winning 
early certainly eases any anxiety he might have as to how he's progressing. 
</P>
<P>
Pate, 27, who will defend his title in the Tournament of Champions starting 
Thursday at La Costa, has steadily advanced on the money list in his 4 years on 
the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
He earned $89,358 in 1985, $176,100 in 1986, $335,728 in 1987 and $582,473 in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"After that great start I was hoping to win more," Pate said. "I guess I was a 
little greedy, but I had a good stretch at the end of the year even though I 
didn't win. Coming back to La Costa puts me in a winning frame of mind again." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has any long-term goals, the Simi Valley resident said: "I'd like 
to win every week but, obviously, that isn't going to happen. I'd like to win 
more than once this year and defend one of my championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't made any major changes in my game, or mental approach. I'm just 
getting better at it, like refining my swing. And I don't let bad things bother 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Pate says the T of C is the best quality field of the year. To qualify one must 
win a PGA Tour tournament, or the British Open in the 12 months since the last 
Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
And there's quite an attrition rate from year to year. Of the record 38 
qualifiers in 1988, only 13 will return to shoot for the first prize of 
$135,000 and a total purse of $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pate, who finished 12th on the money list in 1988, played in 30 tour events in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try to play less than 30 tournaments this year, but I hate to 
read about people making all that money while I'm sitting at home." 
</P>
<P>
The Nabisco Championships last November at Pebble Beach paid Curtis Strange 
$360,000 for winning a playoff with Tom Kite. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Nabisco tournament unfairly tilts the money winning total, Pate 
said: "I think it does. That it can swing that much in one week I don't think 
is particularly fair. But if I had to make a decision of not having the 
tournament, or having it, I'd have it the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Pate is sometimes confused by galleries with Jerry Pate, a former U.S. Open 
winner, whose career has been curtailed by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Pate takes it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I look a whole like Jerry," "A lot of people follow me because 
they think I'm Jerry. In an offhand way it gives me more recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people even ask me about diving in a lake." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Pate made a famous splash after winning the Tournament Players 
Championship in 1982 -- and the memory lingers on. 
</P>
<P>
As for Steve Pate, he might not be adverse to diving in a lake if he shoots 
consecutive rounds of 66 as he did last year on his way to winning the rain 
abbreviated T of C by a stroke over Larry Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
After he won last year, taking a check for $90,000, Pate said: "I'm not going 
to lie to you that I was disappointed that the last round was canceled. A win 
is a win. You take it any way you can." 
</P>
<P>
He has been sharp lately, shooting a 64 to tie the course record at Kapalua in 
Maui in the Kirin Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
It was also a memorable year off the course for Pate. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the fifth hole playing in the Honda tournament when I got word that 
my wife, Sheri, was about ready to have our first child. I ran off the course, 
set a speed record driving to the Miami Airport and just missed the plane by 2 
minutes," he said. "I had to wait 4 hours for the next flight. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles, I raced to the hospital from LAX and missed my daughter 
Nicole's birth by an hour. Fortunately, Sheri and Nicole came through in great 
shape, but I was a nervous wreck." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes

Orel Hershiser, the Dodger Cy Young Award winner; New York Mets catcher Gary 
Carter and Julius (Dr. J) Irving, the former star forward for the Philadelphia 
76ers, will be among celebrities in the 30th annual Bob Hope Chrysler Classic 
to be held Jan. 11-15 over four courses in the Palm Springs area. Other 
celebrities include baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth, and former 
professional sports stars Don Meredith, Johnny Bench and George Blanda. Former 
president Gerald Ford is among the traditional participants. . . . Howard 
Cosell's Day with the All-Americans celebrity tournament precedes the Bob Hope 
tournament on Jan. 10 at the Morningside resort course at Rancho Mirage.

Rare eagles: Cliff Rettig eagled a 495-yard par-5 hole at the San Luis Obispo 
Country Club. Not that newsowrthy in itself. However, his wife, Pat, eagled the 
same hole the next day with a 7-wood shot from 135 yards. . . . Jim Porter has 
been named director of golf at Oakmont Country Club. He replaces Skip Whitt,

BENIRSCHKE HAS MASTERED HIS NEW JOB, DOWN TO THE LETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Rolf Benirschke, the excellent former kicker for the San Diego Chargers, is 
going to be the new host of the daytime "Wheel of Fortune." A bit of a surprise 
choice, wouldn't you say, considering that Rolf Benirschke is not exactly a 
household name -- unless you're in the Zendejas house. Really, let's say you're 
spinning the wheel, and the puzzle's a name, and B, N, R, S, C, H and K are 
already lit, and you buy the I and E. Now you're looking at the whole name, and 
you still can't place it or pronounce it, so you're thinking: It has to be a 
trick puzzle. "Pat, I'd like to buy an A." 
</P>
<P>
Last year in an interview, Vanna White was asked what tips she would give to 
Wheel wanna-bes, and she said, "You have to know the whole alphabet." 
</P>
<P>
Of course! 
</P>
<P>
How stupid I was to think I could get away with stopping at S. 
</P>
<P>
The way Benirschke got the gig is pure Hollywood. He was a guest on an L.A. 
morning TV show, chatting about staying healthy -- you might remember 
Benirschke's near-fatal bout with ulcerative colitis -- and who should be 
watching the show but jaunty little rich guy Merv Griffin, creator of "Wheel of 
Fortune." Merv was so taken by Benirschke, he offered him the host's job on 
"Windfall," Merv's newest game show. According to Benirschke's assistant, 
Debbie Marshall, "Merv conveyed this to Rolf: 'You're a genuine, sincere person 
who loves people, and that's what I'm looking for.' " Gosh darn it, that's what 
separates Merv from the pack, the ability to see all that in one guest shot. 
</P>
<P>
As well he should have been, Benirschke was slightly embarrassed. He hadn't 
gone to college and majored in zoology to be a game-show host. (Years ago I did 
a story on Rick Barry, who told me his ambition was to be a game-show host. He 
was the first real, live person to say that to me. Before that, I assumed 
game-show hosts were bionic Ken dolls.) But Benirschke agreed to do an 
audition. "It was my illness jumping in," Benirschke said, explaining, 
"Surviving my illness taught me how neat life really is, and that you should 
live it and enjoy all of its experiences and possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Benirschke's audition was so impressive that Merv suggested he forget about 
"Windfall" entirely, and aim higher: at The Wheel. In all, 30 tried out for The 
Wheel, including Jimmy Connors. (Hard to believe Jimbo knows all 26 letters. He 
usually gets stuck on "I"; he must have gotten coaching.) Why Benirschke? This 
is a direct quote from Shannon Williams of Merv Griffin Productions: "They 
liked his open and sincere quality. He was real sincere with Vanna. He looks 
good with Vanna -- that's very important -- they make a good look. (They make a 
good look?) Vanna likes him. And he understands the game." Excuse me, the 
people who don't understand the game, what stumps them, is it tricky consonants 
like J and V? Do they think the game is unfair, that it aims too high up the 
intelligentsia ladder? 
</P>
<P>
Some will ask if Rolf Benirschke was really the most qualified man to fill Pat 
Sajak's shoes. (We're talking gigantic shoes in game-show annal.) Merv liked 
him, and that's good enough for me. Don't laugh. Dan Quayle got to be vice 
president because George Bush liked him, and that was good enough for you. Come 
to think of it, Dan Quayle looks just like a game-show host. Anyway, what are 
the qualifications? The ability to spell his own name seems to overqualify Rolf 
Benirschke for "Wheel of Fortune." Anybody can spell Vanna White. Well, that 
double-N might be too much for some people, but it's not like the only thing 
keeping if off PBS. 
</P>
<P>
A fine, bright and charitable fellow -- the NFL's "Man of the Year" in 1983 and 
co-chairman of the National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis -- Benirschke 
has maintained his sense of humor about his new job. The other day he was asked 
if it didn't feel a bit preposterous to be a game-show host, and he said, 
"Obviously it does. My father (Dr. Kurt Benirschke) is an internationally known 
professor of pathology, a physician, an author, and his son is asking people: 
'Do you want to buy a vowel?' " 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, it's a breakthrough. Other athletes have become actors, such as Ed 
Marinaro, Mike Warren, Fred Dryer and Alex Karras. But game-show hosting is a 
whole new field for jocks to consider. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie (Silent Movie) Murray, for example. He's well suited for a non-verbal 
show like "Win, Lose or Draw." Tommy Lasorda could guest-host, and they could 
change the name of the show to "Win, Lose or Eat." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, who's in more "Jeopardy" than Jerry Tarkanian? 
</P>
<P>
"The Newlywed Game" is a natural for veterans Joe Montana or Hal Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
George Steinbrenner could host "The Price Is Right," and yell out, "Billy 
Martin, you sly boots, come on down . . . again!" 
</P>
<P>
Mike and Robin absolutely have to co-host "Love Connection." 
</P>
<P>
For "The Dating Game," the leaders in the clubhouse are Wade (Mr. Polaroid) 
Boggs and Mark (Do You Think I'm Sexy, Or Simply Stupid) Gastineau. 
</P>
<P>
So Rolf, good luck, we'll be watching. And remember, it's A, E, I, O, U and 
sometimes Y.

BRILLIANCE ROUTINE FOR MARIO LEMIEUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF JACOBS, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rob Brown, who resembles Benjamin Franklin and is almost as quotable, looked at 
the questioner as if he were some kind of heretic. 
</P>
<P>
"Does ANYTHING Mario Lemieux do on the ice surprise me?" Brown, 20, a 
Pittsburgh Penguins winger, said, repeating the question. "People who only see 
him play once in a while may be shocked when they see Mario make some 
incredible move or score some unbelievable goal. But when you see him play all 
the time and he's on your team, you are not surprised. You are just thankful 
that you can expect his greatness." 
</P>
<P>
What Brown is describing is routine brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
Routine brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
Those two words aren't compatible, because there is nothing humdrum about 
greatness. But it is within the domain of night-in and night-out performance 
that Lemieux has risen to such a consistent level that even at 23 he is 
knocking on the door of immortality. It is difficult to describe this 6-foot-4, 
215-pound skating octopus any other way. Lemieux's combination of size, reach, 
skill and strength handling the puck are unique. 
</P>
<P>
He's a playmaker with a feathery touch and field of vision second only to Wayne 
Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
He can work free in front of the net and unleash a sniper's bullet a la Phil 
Esposito in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
And he uses what seems like 15-foot rubber arms to control the puck and the 
tempo of the game like no one else in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
"God only knows what's going to come from Mario Lemieux next," Edmonton's Craig 
Simpson said of his former Penguins teammate. 
</P>
<P>
"When Gretzky broke 200 points and went on to set the record (215 points in 
1985-86), everybody wondered if it would ever be broken," Hartford Whalers 
President and General Manager Emile Francis said. "Forget in Gretzky's 
lifetime. Lemieux might do it while Wayne's still in his prime." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his NHL career, the critics complained the kid didn't care enough. 
He didn't have enough heart. He was two zones away while his team was on 
defense. He turned it on and off as his mood hit and, like the Penguins, folded 
down the stretch. All that has changed the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne Gretzky taught Mario how to win," said Mr. Hockey, Gordie Howe. "In my 
mind, Mario became a hockey player at last year's Canada Cup. Before he was a 
talent, a great talent. But he was weak defensively and didn't seem to be 
involved at all times. Now, he's damn near as good a hockey player as Wayne is. 
</P>
<P>
"And he can do things that Wayne isn't physically able to do. The way he uses 
those arms and his strength to control the puck when it's about five feet away 
from him is unbelievable. That big son of a gun is something else." 
</P>
<P>
As much as the Universal Gretzky Adoration Society does not want to admit it, 
the time has come when Lemieux perhaps should no longer be held in comparison 
to Gretzky. At this point, Gretzky probably should be compared to Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
After being limited to one assist in a 2-2 tie in New Jersey on Friday, Lemieux 
entered Monday night's game against the Whalers at the Hartford Civic Center 
leading the NHL with 92 points (36 goals, 56 assists) in 33 games. If Lemieux 
doesn't miss any more games to injury, his 2.79-points-a-game pace would give 
him an NHL record 217 points. His goal pace is headed for 85, which would be 
second only to Gretzky's 92 goals in 1981-82. All those projections won't mean 
a hill of beans if Lemieux rips off another 41-point barrage like he did in the 
first 12 games of this season before missing a few games with a wrist injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win the scoring title, with Gretzky (82 points), Bernie Nicholls 
(83) and myself there's a challenge," Lemieux said. "I want to be the best I 
can. But after a while all the Lemieux vs. Gretzky (comparisons) can get a 
little old. I'm sure Wayne feels the same way. I really admire him. But I want 
to be recognized as Mario Lemieux and judged on what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
"There's got to be some friendly competition between the two," Brown said. "But 
Mario hears it so much. Wouldn't you get tired of it, too?" 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that Gretzky served as a teacher in Lemieux's maturation process. 
Gretzky showed Lemieux the door to immortality, but Lemieux had to be the one 
to open it. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1987 Canada Cup, Lemieux played on Gretzky's wing. They pushed each 
other to a higher level. As Team Canada Coach Jean Perron said at the time, 
"Buckle up because we're going into hockey space." 
</P>
<P>
The two complemented each other. They challenged each other. Much of it was 
done not in words, but in the reflex actions of peerless talents. Lemieux 
scored 11 goals in nine games. Gretzky assisted on nine of them. 
</P>
<P>
For purists, the three-game Canada Cup series against the Soviets may well have 
been the greatest hockey ever played. And the riveting overtime thriller in 
Game 2 at Hamilton may have been the greatest single game in hockey history. 
Lemieux won it. Gretzky assisted. In the final minute of the decisive third 
game, Canada broke the deadlock. Goal Lemieux. Assist Gretzky. Match to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no denying how much winning at the Canada Cup meant to me," Lemieux 
said, criticized in the past for turning down invitations to the world 
championships after Pittsburgh had failed to make the NHL playoffs. "Wayne was 
terrific. It gave me confidence that I could play with the best in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Howe is big buddies with Gretzky. It would be a major upset for him to admit 
publicly that Lemieux is better. But others have said it. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, Mario Lemieux is the best player in the world," Detroit Coach 
Jacques Demers said. 
</P>
<P>
A Lemieux vs. Gretzky poll in the Whalers' locker room earlier this season 
showed that more players believed Lemieux's talent was No. 1, but that they'd 
still want Gretzky when it mattered most. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Liut said you don't surpass Gretzky. You can only match him. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Peterson said, "For the regular season, I'd take Lemieux. For the 
playoffs, I'd take Gretzky." 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux cannot be shocked by such talk. Even though Gretzky missed 16 games 
because of injury last season, Lemieux scored NHL highs of 70 goals and 168 
points to break Gretzky's run of eight Hart Trophies as league MVP. And his 
six-point performance in last year's All-Star Game in St. Louis was frightening 
in its dominance.

The Paris-Dakar rally moved into Sebha, the boyhood home of Libyan leader 
Moammar Kadafi, with Belgian Jacky Ickx holding the automobile lead and 
Spaniard Carlos Mas edging ahead in the motorcycle division. 
</P>
<P>
Upon reaching the checkpoint after a day's drive through the desert, exhausted 
rally drivers were greeted with promises from Kadafi for a special New Year's 
Eve day banquet for the racers and for permission to exclude the drivers and 
their support teams from the ban on alcohol in his Islamic society.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

<P>
LOUISVILLE ROLLS OVER KENTUCKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Cornelius Holden knew Louisville fans were looking for a big victory over 
Kentucky Saturday. He and his teammates were more than happy to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
"People didn't just want us to beat them," Holden said. "They wanted us to blow 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
It might not have been a blowout, but the No. 14-ranked Cardinals used a 
balanced scoring attack and their superior depth to score a decisive 97-75 
victory at Louisville's Freedom Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville had not beaten Kentucky since a 71-64 victory in Freedom Hall Dec. 
15, 1984. The Wildcats, who had won the last 3 meetings, still hold a 14-6 
series advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The victory is a step in the right direction because we finished December 
undefeated," said Pervis Ellison, who led Louisville with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville's reserves, paced by Everick Sullivan with 15 points, outscored 
Kentucky's reserves, 31-3, as the Cardinals (7-2) won their seventh straight 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville Coach Denny Crum said his ability to send in fresh players at will 
forced Kentucky (5-7) into an up-tempo game. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing we wanted them to do was to run and shoot in an 
up-tempo game," Crum said. "We took advantage of our depth and got good play 
off our bench." 
</P>
<P>
Consecutive 3-point shots by Derrick Miller pulled Kentucky to within 54-43 
with 1:43 left, but Louisville scored 11 of the next 14 points to put the game 
out of reach, 65-46, at the 11:20 mark. Kentucky never got closer than 12. 
</P>
<P>
Miller led Kentucky with 34 points, including 5 3-pointers. Freshman scored 13 
points for the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri 96, Morgan State 66 -- Lee Coward scored 7 points and Gary Leonard 
added 4 during a 20-2 run that gave the Tigers a 36-13 lead with 5:18 remaining 
in the first half, and No. 11 Missouri went on to rout the Bears at Columbia, 
Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, a senior center whose previous career high was 17 points, led the 
Tigers (12-3) with 23. Morgan State's James McCoy led all scorers with 27 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan State (4-5) was outrebounded, 44-28. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Little Rock 89, Marshall 79 -- Johnnie Bell scored 20 points and had 
13 rebounds to lead the Trojans past the Thundering Herd in the championship 
game of the Arkansas Little Rock tournament at Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans were ahead, 66-50, with 11 minutes left when Marshall mounted a 
comeback to pull within 82-76 with 1:29 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State 72, Clemson 58 -- The victory at Portland late Friday night gave 
the Beavers their second straight Far West tournament title. It was their 17th 
title in the tournament's 33-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The championship also was the seventh for Ralph Miller in his 19 seasons at 
Oregon State. Miller, 69, is retiring at the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State (7-3) took the lead for good at 44-41 with 15:40 to play on one of 
Gary Payton's 4 3-point shots. The basket started an 18-9 run that gave the 
Beavers a 59-50 lead on another Payton 3-pointer with 7:26 left. 
</P>
<P>
Payton, a junior guard, scored 18 points, had 7 assists and was named the 
tournament MVP. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers are 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois 96, Hawaii 87 -- Senior guard Kenny Battle scored a career-high 29 
points and Nick Anderson added 26 as the No. 4 Illini remained unbeaten at 12-0 
by winning the Rainbow tournament late Friday night at Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
With 14:06 remaining in the game, Chris Gaines gave Hawaii a 60-58 lead when he 
scored on a fast-break layup. Anderson, who scored 18 of his points in the 
second half, then made a 3-point play with 13:48 to go, giving Illinois a lead 
it never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii (7-4), which lost its first home game, was led by Reggie Cross with 24 
points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Georgia Tech beat Purdue, 72-69, for third place.

Zola Budd says she would like to run again for Britain but that she never will 
denounce apartheid despite pressure from opponents of the racial separation 
laws of her native South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview telecast on Britain's ITV network, the former world champion 
middle-distance runner said that although her personal beliefs do not favor 
apartheid, she would refrain from public criticism of the South African regime 
or its policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never regret not denouncing apartheid," she said. "I have strong views 
about South African politics and I still don't feel I need to make public 
statements." 
</P>
<P>
Budd returned to South Africa from Britain last spring after anti-apartheid 
groups applied pressure to keep her from competing for her adopted country in 
the world cross-country championships in New Zealand.

STEROID REPORT A REVELATION TO CIF HIERARCHY; 
</P>
<P>
'EPIDEMIC' SURPRISES ADMINISTRATORS, COACHES

The heads of 2 commissions that oversee athletics in all public high schools in 
Southern California said that they were surprised by the findings of a recent 
national survey indicating that 1 of every 15 boys in 12th grade has used 
anabolic steroids. Both said that they have never received a report of a 
student using the muscle-building drug. 
</P>
<P>
But a national expert on drug abuse said that steroid use among high school 
students is rising sharply and is at epidemic levels in some Southern 
California communities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a frightening situation," said Dr. Forest S. Tennant of West Covina, a 
leader in the treatment of substance abuse. Tennant has treated many 
professional athletes for cocaine dependency, including former Dodger pitcher 
Steve Howe and NBA star Walter Davis. "I have seen blood-test results from 
users of anabolic steroids. I have been shocked to see the dramatic effects 
they have on the human body." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant, who operates a drug abuse treatment center in Van Nuys, said that his 
studies have shown steroids to have a dramatic impact on the adrenal gland and 
the immune system and to cause cholesterol levels to soar in most users. 
</P>
<P>
A study published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., 
purported to be the first nationwide survey of steroid use among high school 
boys, found that of the 3,403 seniors interviewed at 46 schools, 6.6% of them 
said that they were using or had used steroids. Most said that they took the 
drug to enhance their athletic performance, but 26.7% were non-athletes who 
said that they used steroids to build muscles and improve their physical 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Thomas, the commissioner of the of the California Interscholastic 
Federation Southern Section -- which oversees more than 500 schools -- said 
that his organization has never had a report of steroid use by a local high 
school athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"None. Not a single report," Thomas said. "But I am certain it goes on. It's 
like marijuana use in your high school. You'd be crazy to say it doesn't go on. 
It's the same thing with steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am just overwhelmed to hear those numbers. The numbers are scary." 
</P>
<P>
Hal Harkness, the director of interscholastic athletics for the City Section -- 
which oversees 49 Los Angeles School District programs -- said that he knows of 
no incidents involving steroid use by athletes in city schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had no calls about it, ever," he said. "I have heard absolutely no 
comments in over two years in this position from anyone in our schools 
regarding steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that the reason for the lack of reports on steroid use by students 
is that coaches and administrators don't know what they're looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are waiting to get reports on steroid use like they get reports of 
kids using marijuana or cocaine, then they will never get any reports," Tennant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Steroids are not taken in that manner, at lunchtime or at smoke break at 
school. Steroids are taken in a very programmed way, at a very intentional time 
and place, most likely away from the school. Users of cocaine and marijuana 
take those drugs when they are passed to them." 
</P>
<P>
The study reported that more than one-third of the seniors who said they have 
taken steroids took them both orally and by injection. Only one-fifth of those 
who claimed to use steroids said they got the drugs from a health-care 
professional. The majority obtained the steroids from other athletes, coaches 
and people who frequent gyms, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that he began to see widespread steroid use among adolescents 4 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The figures in the national study just released are not only believable, but 
in Southern California I think they are higher than that," he said. "It is 
spotty. In some communities people have never seen or heard about anabolic 
steroids. In others, it's an epidemic. As long as four years ago, I had 
substantiated reports of parents and coaches giving steroids to Little League 
baseball players and Pop Warner football players. 
</P>
<P>
"This study is a validation of something I have seen for the last four years. I 
support what it said and I agree with its findings." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant was especially alarmed at the reasons some steroid users gave for 
taking the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"The most frightening aspect of steroid use is that adolescents are using them 
to alter their basic physical appearance," he said. "They perceive that doing 
that will make them more sexually attractive or give them some success in life 
that they can't achieve otherwise. It symbolizes something that has gone sour 
in our society, that our natural body and our natural talents are not worthy 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Redell, a veteran high school football coach who recently resigned from 
his post at Crespi High, said that he encountered only 1 player at Crespi whom 
he suspected of using steroids. But he said that the results of the national 
study are not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't surprise me a bit to see those numbers," said Redell, who also 
played and coached in the defunct U. S. Football League. "The pressure on the 
kids today to win, and to perform well, is greater than ever. There are parents 
who pressure their own kids into taking steroids, not only not condemning 
steroid use but actually encouraging it. The pressure is to gain major college 
scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon High Coach Harry Welch, who has run the Valley-area's most successful 
football program for the past 7 years, said that he has never encountered 
steroid use among his players. 
</P>
<P>
"We discuss drugs but I haven't discussed steroids because I've never seen the 
need," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Welch added that he condemns steroid use, equating it with so-called 
recreational drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It really scares me," he said. "I've read that it affects the reproductive 
system. To even flirt with using something that could affect your sexual 
identity or the future of your children . . . I would condemn it in the 
harshest way." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland High Coach Steve Landress found it difficult to believe the 
statistics, saying that he has never heard of high school athletes -- or 
students -- using steroids during his 13 years of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
He especially ruled out athletes, saying top players have no need for such 
drugs at the high school level. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys who are Division I-type players are so much better than other players 
they don't need it," he said. "Even a few years ago when it wasn't such a big 
thing to say you used steroids, I never heard anyone talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said that the Southern Section has never discussed the issue of steroids 
with coaches and has never sent memos to coaches informing them of indications 
of steroid use by players. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we felt it should be common sense," Thomas said. "If a kid goes from 
165 pounds to 205 pounds in six months, a coach should have a clue that 
steroids might be involved. I guess we assumed they would know. But I'm not 
satisfied anymore with where we are with this issue. We have to do more." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, however, said that the Southern Section has no firm plan to deal with 
steroid use. He said that the organization is involved in an educational 
program sponsored by the Los Angeles Amateur Athletic Foundation and is 
participating in another steroid awareness program sponsored by the Orange 
County Sheriff's Deparment. 
</P>
<P>
"We have run articles about steroid use in our football game programs," Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Testing players for steroids has never been seriously considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly have to admit we have been remiss in the world of drug abuse," 
Thomas said. "Drugs are a problem in our high schools in general, but the CIF 
Southern Section should take a leadership role (against) drug abuse, including 
the use of steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Harkness said that the City Section may implement a steroid awareness program 
early next year. There will be no drug testing, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not even consider voluntary drug testing," he said. "To begin with, 
voluntary testing is not effective. Those individuals who even think they might 
test positively for steroids simply won't volunteer for the testing. And 
mandatory testing is absolutely out of the question. We just don't have the 
right to do that and it wouldn't even be considered." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that the solution is a massive and immediate educational program. 
</P>
<P>
"The educational pitch is simple," he said. "No. 1, sports are here only to 
spend a little time in your young years competing, learning team spirit and 
discipline and fitness and competition. Anabolic steroids just don't have a 
place in that. They don't belong, and don't use them. Ever. They will hurt you. 
</P>
<P>
"And we have to repeat that message to our kids, over and over. Repetition. 
That's how we got people to wear seat belts and to brush their teeth and to 
lose weight. You keep giving them this message, again and again: Don't use 
steroids."

BASKETBALL RACE SHAPES UP AS RERUN; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDING CHAMPIONS VENTURA, SANTA MONICA FAVORED IN REALIGNED WSC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Santa Monica and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
That is the answer, which comes without hesitation, from Western State 
Conference basketball coaches asked to name the favorites in this season's race 
for the WSC title. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two are head and shoulders above everyone else in the conference 
talent-wise," Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin said. "Everybody else is right 
there together." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica and Ventura shared the championship last season with 11-2 records, 
and no one affiliated with the conference is bold enough to predict that it 
might not be a similar scenario this time around. 
</P>
<P>
The WSC has been slightly realigned after the defection of Allan Hancock 
College to the Central Valley Conference and the entry of Valley and West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Valley, which played in the Southern California Conference last season, and 
West L. A. will join the South Division, which also includes Santa Monica, 
Canyons, Glendale and Bakersfield. The North Division comprises Ventura, 
Moorpark, Cuesta, Santa Barbara and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Coach John McMullen grudgingly admits that his Corsairs may be the 
team to beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose on our preseason record and returning lettermen that's the case," 
said McMullen, whose team is 15-3 and has won the Rancho Santiago, Compton, 
Merced and Pasadena tournaments. "If that's true, we're not that far ahead of 
anybody else. I've seen Valley, Canyons, Moorpark and Glendale, and they're all 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, all of the Valley-area teams have tasted success during the 
preconference schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (9-8), though plagued by inconsistency, has looked spectacular at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars finished 8-5 in the WSC last season and made the playoffs for the 
fourth year in a row. This season, they finished second in the Glendale 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Smelser, in his 20th season as coach at Canyons, said the WSC likely will 
be one of the best conferences in the state. Whether his team will be among the 
best in the conference, however, will depend on its ability to eliminate 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a manner of transition, trying to be halfway decent and struggling," 
said Smelser, whose team opens WSC play Tuesday at West L. A. "We haven't been 
able to put the whole package together. That's been kind of frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
For a variety of reasons, Glendale (9-6) lost 4 players -- potentially, a 
strong nucleus -- from a young team that finished 6-7 in the WSC last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros, who open WSC play Wednesday at Santa Monica, are once again a 
young outfit, but the team has shown steady improvement despite its youth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing all right considering what happened," said Beauchemin, who is in 
his 10th season with the Vaqueros. "The players are starting to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Valley (10-6), which joins the WSC after competing in the Southern California 
Conference, has a talented team led by center Oral Elrington and could give 
some teams trouble if the Monarchs are able to develop depth. Valley's first 
test comes Wednesday at Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (8-7 entering the weekend), though dominated by freshmen, should 
improve steadily under Al Nordquist, who is in his 22nd season with the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Roger Thomas, a freshman from Leuzinger High, is averaging 10.9 
points a game to lead the Raiders. Moorpark opens its conference schedule 
Wednesday at home against Cuesta. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard, which finished 1-12 last season, is the most improved team in the WSC. 
Santa Barbara won its own tournament and also is considered a conference dark 
horse. 
</P>
<P>
But in a conference with Santa Monica and Ventura, every team is a long-shot to 
displace the reigning co-champions. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (13-2 entering the weekend) might have lost conference MVP Cedric 
Ceballos, but the Pirates have been buoyed by the play of all-conference point 
guard Tony Walker, who is averaging 9.6 assists, and freshman forward Reggie 
Betton, who is averaging 13.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, which opens WSC play Wednesday at Santa Barbara, has won the Cypress 
and Ventura tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica has 7 players back from a team that lost to Merced in the 
quarterfinals of the state tournament last season, including All-WSC forward 
Keith Amerson, forwards Von Shuler and Kemo Patrick and guards DeShawn Pullard 
and Troy Batiste, all of whom average more than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks to me as if this is one of the strongest conferences overall in 
Southern California," McMullen said. "I feel that everybody has a team that can 
beat anybody else on a given night."

FACES TO WATCH NEXT SEASON: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOLS 
</P>
<P>
Chris Alexander, Hawthorne track -- The state's dominant track team continues 
to produce blue-chip talent. The latest could be Alexander, who was on the 
state champion relays last June as a freshman. He also plays football, but a 
broken arm ended his season early. 
</P>
<P>
Piper Hahn and Kristal Attwood, Mira Costa volleyball -- Mira Costa bowed out 
in the CIF 5-A finals, but then this was a rebuilding year with an entirely 
underclass lineup. Hahn figures to be one of the top prep players in the nation 
next year, with Attwood not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Clover, Rolling Hills basketball -- The junior guard has blossomed into 
one of the Southland's top 3-point shooters and will be a coveted college 
recruit next year when he will be out of John Hardy's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Leslie, Morningside basketball -- College coaches will have to wait for 
the next dominating center, because she'll only be a high school senior next 
year. The 6-foot-5 Monarch is already rated in the top handful of female 
players in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Nkosi Littleton, Carson football -- The Colts' all-star defensive tackle may be 
the most athletic lineman around next year. The only non-senior on the All-City 
first team, the 6-2, 210-pound junior is also one of the school's best 
basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
John Ma'ae and Derek Sparks, Banning football -- Opponents have to cringe at 
the thought of quarterback Ma'ae, who will be a three-year starter, handing off 
to the powerful running back Sparks, who emerged this year as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
Marcel Bridges, Harbor College football -- It was difficult for a receiver to 
stand out in Harbor's offense, but the talented freshman earned all-conference 
honors and all-state honorable mention. Now if the Seahawks can only find a 
quarterback. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Frank Dolce, El Camino College football -- El Camino has been "Quarterbacks R 
Us" for most of the decade, and Dolce will return with some impressive stats. 
Most impressive -- he led the Warriors to their second straight PONY Bowl 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Haro, El Camino College soccer -- The L.A. high school player of the year 
wasted no time establishing himself on the community college level, leading the 
Warriors to the Southern California Conference title while earning SCC Player 
of the Year honors. 
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSITIES 
</P>
<P>
Devon Akita, Dominguez Hills volleyball/basketball -- Two programs trying to 
establish themselves are counting on the 5-7 sophomore. She may have the talent 
to earn all-conference honors in both sports. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Barksdale, Dominguez Hills basketball -- In Dick Vitale slang, the Toro 
sophomore guard is a "Dow Joneser" -- up and down. But by the time he's a 
senior the 6-foot-1 Barksdale could be the best shooting point guard in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Miah Bradbury, Mike McNary and Tim Williams, Loyola Marymount baseball -- The 
Lions have had a string of All-Americans in recent years, and this trio is 
bidding to join them. Bradbury, a strong-armed, heavy-hitting catcher, was one 
of the hitting stars of the NCAA Regionals last spring. McNary, a poised 
sophomore right-hander, toils in lefty Steve Surico's shadow but figures to be 
a staff mainstay. Line drives jump off the bat of Williams, also a sophomore, 
who is looking for a home either at first or in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Donlon, Loyola Marymount volleyball -- The Lions' men's team is trying to 
turn the corner, and Donlon may be the cornerstone in becoming more 
competitive. The 6-6 sophomore may be Loyola's best player since Olympian Paul 
Sunderland in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Flanagan, Dominguez Hills soccer -- The Toro forward was outshined this 
year by the scoring of transfer Willie Ayala -- who also returns -- but 
Flanagan figures to end his senior year leading the Toros in virtually every 
career offensive category. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell Lowery, Loyola Marymount basketball -- Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and Jeff 
Fryer figure to be filling up the basket again next season, but the key man in 
Paul Westhead's offense is the point guard, and the slender freshman figures to 
be the one getting them the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Kristi White, Dominguez Hills soccer -- The midfielder has earned post-season 
honors for the Toros, but Coach Marine Cano is still waiting for her to develop 
the scoring touch he anticipated. If she blossoms as a senior, the Toros could 
have a devastating attack. ALAN DROOZ

GRANADA HILLS SCOUT RATES FOOTBALL PROSPECTS TO PROVIDE SHOPPING ASSISTANCE BY

<P>
Foster Andersen at a high school football game: He draws a bead on an offensive 
lineman's feet. Are they quick feet? Or slow feet? Then he focuses on a 
defensive back's hips. How fast can they switch gears from forward to reverse? 
Next, he zeroes in on a receiver's hands. Soft or hard? And the quarterback's 
arm. How strong? 
</P>
<P>
To Andersen, winning isn't everything, anatomy is. Every week during the 
football season, he sees a minimum of 3 high school and 2 junior college games. 
He doesn't care about results. He doesn't root. He just scrutinizes hands and 
feet and hips and arms and puts all the body parts together to form a 
well-rounded opinion of a player. 
</P>
<P>
As the owner of Sports Search, a scouting service he runs out of his Granada 
Hills home, Andersen judges football prospects and sells his evaluations to 
major colleges such as USC, UCLA and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
This past season, he and 2 associates analyzed the college potential of 400 
high school and 400 junior college players in the vast football caldron of 
Southern California. That's a lot of body parts. 
</P>
<P>
"But I never get tired of going to games," says Andersen, 48, a two-way lineman 
for UCLA in the early 1960s and former head coach at Cal State L. A. "It's the 
parking that bugs me." 
</P>
<P>
Scouting services such as Andersen's are in vogue -- USC subscribes to about 50 
-- because the NCAA has tightened the screws on recruiting. As of this year, 
colleges cannot even scout a prospect until Nov. 1. To cover ground quickly and 
thoroughly, they buy reports from scouting services, which rate the best 
players. Andersen sells his service for as much as $800 a year for voluminous 
compilations or as little as $75 for, say, a breakdown on quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our reports allow a college staff to prioritize its time," Andersen says. "We 
tell them who they should concentrate on and who's a waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
The fear of missing a blue-chip player also drives colleges to subscribe to 
scouting services. "We cross-reference players rated by the various services," 
says USC recruiting coordinator Jack Himebauch. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen assigns a rating to each player he scouts. The best is a 1+, which 
represents "the guys I'd want if I were coach at USC or UCLA," he says. Players 
rated as a 1 or 1- are Division I caliber. A 2+ would be the best player 
available for Division II schools. Of the 400 high school players he has 
evaluated this year, "150 are capable of playing in Division I and maybe 30 are 
rated 1+," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But his ratings are not chiseled in stone. Colleges use scouting services as an 
aid, not a directive, often disagreeing with or ignoring their recommendations. 
"Coaches still make their own evaluations," Himebauch says. "They don't rely on 
somebody else's opinion to offer a player a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Andersen says he was pushing Jack Swan of El Camino Royal High as 
"the best offensive lineman in the Valley." But neither USC nor UCLA recruited 
him, Andersen says, because at 6-3, he was shorter than their prototype 
lineman. But one of Sports Search's subscribers, the University of Georgia, 
gave Swan a scholarship and "think they stole him out of Southern California," 
Andersen says. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen puts all his information in an IBM computer in the family room of his 
ranch house. Players are listed alphabetically and by position. Aside from 
ratings, Andersen includes capsule comments on each player, "little bits of 
information coaches like." Typing on the computer keyboard -- "I had to learn 
to type to go into this business," he says -- Andersen called up Hart High 
tight end Brian Allen. The comment read: 
</P>
<P>
"Catches with hands. Doesn't look like he'll fill out for different positions 
because of body type." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen explained, "Coaches don't necessarily like receivers who catch the 
ball against their pads, and they also want to know if a prospect has the 
potential to play other positions," such as offensive or defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
In the analysis of Crespi running back Russell White, Andersen mentioned that 
he could also be "a great defensive back." White, of course, got Andersen's 
highest rating despite nagging injuries and a "weak offensive line" this 
season. "I watched him in practice," Andersen says, "and his work ethic is 
very, very good." 
</P>
<P>
But who is the best back in the L. A. area? Andersen likes Hawthorne 
quarterback Curtis Conway, projecting him as a college tailback. Andersen's 
computer comment says Conway "may be the next Marcus Allen." 
</P>
<P>
An assistant coach at USC under Ted Tollner, Andersen was out of a job when 
Larry Smith brought in his own assistants 2 years ago. So Andersen, along with 
computer expert Dick Laugens, started Sports Search, hiring former USC 
assistants Larry Bryan and Nate Shaw to help with the scouting. They specialize 
in Southern California players "because California supplies 15% of the players 
in Division I," Andersen says. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen has opinions on where to find the best players in the area. "Banning 
and Carson have the premier concentration of athletes in public schools," he 
says. "In private schools, it's Loyola and Crespi. They have good coaches and 
an administration that wants football to be a unifying force on campus." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen says that San Fernando High has the best talent in the Valley this 
year and Orange County "is where you'll find the great linemen." Inner-city 
schools, he says, "traditionally produce great running backs and receivers." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen sometimes disagrees with all-star teams, which he says are based on 
"politics." For instance, the Golden League put defensive lineman Sean McCune 
of Canyon High on its second team. "I think he'd leave some of the first team 
in the dirt," Andersen says. He gave Granada Hills defensive lineman Anthony 
Hall a 1+ but Hall didn't make All-North Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 1988 season is behind him, Andersen will not be taking it easy 
until the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Scouting is a full-time, year-round job. "We're working on our spring list -- 
juniors in high school," he says. So he will be attending spring practices -- 
and watching lots of body parts.

With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in 
1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven reasons the Padres' 1989 season will be different from 1988: 
</P>
<P>
1. They won't have to worry about a club president making an obscene gesture to 
the fans on Fan Appreciation Night. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Padres no longer have a club president. Chub Feeney resigned last 
fall within hours of wagging an obscene right-hand gesture at some heckling 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Feeney has reportedly moved back to the comforts of San Francisco, 
where his gesture is the social equivalent of a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
Third, if club officials are smart, they will hold this year's fan appreciation 
activities during an afternoon game. Even if Feeney chooses to fly down for an 
encore, he'll probably be napping at that hour if last year's routine is any 
indication. 
</P>
<P>
2. They won't have to worry about a manager engaging in a fist fight with any 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bowa is gone. Stanley Jefferson is gone. 
</P>
<P>
And the last person dumb enough to mess with Jack McKeon, Bowa's replacement, 
still has the cigar burns to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
3. They won't have to worry about firing a manager at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It worked with Bowa, who was canned on May 28 in New York while still in his 
pajamas. But it won't work with McKeon. Virtually every day on the road at 7 
a.m., he's in church. Considering the erratic history of Padre management, 
that's not a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
4. They won't have to worry about losing a starting third baseman for 3 days 
with a bruised tooth root. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Brown is gone. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, the Padres also won't have to worry about losing a 
starting third baseman for a week because he twisted his heel walking off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Or worry about losing a starting third baseman for a week because he hurt his 
thumb sucker-punching one of the club's reserve outfielders (Marvell Wynne). 
</P>
<P>
Or worry about losing a starting third baseman for 5 minutes during the middle 
of the game because of a broken jockstrap. 
</P>
<P>
Where did Chris Brown go? 
</P>
<P>
Does it matter? 
</P>
<P>
5. They won't have to worry about their home-run hitter turning a cartwheel 
after a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Moreland is gone, having been shipped with Brown to Detroit. In Detroit, 
the players turn cartwheels following every home run, delighted that they have 
just trotted 360 feet in public without being shot. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' new home run hitter, Jack Clark, turned his first and last 
cartwheel when he found he was being traded here from the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon was dumb enough to try a cartwheel just once, and he has the cigar 
burns to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
6. They won't have to worry about any frustrated manager or fan wanting to tear 
Jimmy Jones' face off. 
</P>
<P>
The mild-mannered and erratic starting pitcher has been traded to the New York 
Yankees. The latest New York Post insta-poll says his face won't make it to the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
7. They won't have to worry about pitcher Andy Hawkins' shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins became a free agent and signed with the New York Yankees for about 
double what he would have been paid in San Diego, partially because the Padres 
were worried about a right shoulder that caused him trouble in 1987 and may 
have hindered him late in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In his first press conference as a Yankee, he said he was looking forward to 
moving out of San Diego and settling his wife and family in New York. The 
Yankees aren't worried about his shoulder -- they are worried about his head.

AMERICA'S CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in 
1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven reasons why the 1988 America's Cup defense was a farce: 
</P>
<P>
1. It did not occur to New Zealand's Michael Fay that Stars &amp; Stripes would 
be a catamaran. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand had made its surprise challenge in a 90-foot monohull in July 1987, 
assuming Sail America would respond in kind. 
</P>
<P>
The Kiwi challenge, based on a literal interpretation of the America's Cup Deed 
of Gift, was upheld in the New York Supreme Court in November 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But the same literal interpretation of the Deed of Gift caused Sail America to 
respond with the catamaran. 
</P>
<P>
2. San Diego, home of the San Diego Yacht Club, was left hanging for months on 
whether the 1988 races would be held off the San Diego coast. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the City of San Diego was actually rebuffed in court in an 
attempt to assert its right to be a party to the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on Jan. 22, Sail America announced that the races would be held off 
either Long Beach or Hawaii. In March, Sail America finally announced that the 
races would be off the San Diego coast in September. 
</P>
<P>
3. Michael Fay complained about Stars &amp; Stripes' commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Marlboro logo on Stars &amp; Stripes, New Zealand hoisted a 
sail that said: "Surgeon General's Warning: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly 
Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health" in the days leading up to the first race. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, Stars &amp; Stripes skipper Dennis Conner was race commodore for an 
American Cancer Society regatta. 
</P>
<P>
4. Michael Fay whined and complained about how horrible this mismatch was going 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
For months and months, he complained. 
</P>
<P>
Encountering a couple of women bicyclists near the Kiwi compound, he said: "Do 
you ladies know what this race will be like? Why, it will be like you two 
racing your bicycles against motorbikes." 
</P>
<P>
Just before the racing, Fay announced the results of a Kiwi-commissioned Gallup 
Poll which concluded that 53% of Americans thought the race was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
He did not make a big issue of the fact that 51% of Americans polled were 
unaware of any such controversy. 
</P>
<P>
5. The races were horrible mismatches. 
</P>
<P>
Stars &amp; Stripes won the first race by 18 minutes 15 seconds on Sept. 7 and 
concluded a sweep of the best-of-three series with a 21-minute 10-second 
victory 2 days later. 
</P>
<P>
6. Sportsmanship was as horrible as the competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Kiwis accused Conner of intentionally sandbagging to keep the margin of 
victory from being even greater than it was. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider what they did to be disgraceful," skipper David Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have gone out there and beaten us by 1 1/2 to 2 hours," designer 
Bruce Farr said. 
</P>
<P>
That was after the first race. After the second race, a press conference turned 
into a literal and verbal shoving match with grown men called each other liars 
and losers. 
</P>
<P>
7. It's not over. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Michael Fay went back to the New York Supreme Court to ask that the 
race be forfeited to New Zealand because of how unfair it was that his monohull 
had to race against a catamaran. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the outcome of this continuing legal hassle will provide a farcical 
beginning to 1989. DAVE DISTEL

SOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS ELLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in 
1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Six steps that made the Sockers' spring and summer seem like a walk through 
the Twilight Zone, or the Museum of the Hard-To-Believe: 
</P>
<P>
1. There's a sign post up ahead, and your next stop is ... 
</P>
<P>
The first indication this would not be a typical year came April 25. Ron 
Fowler, the chairman of Sockers' Management Inc., filed for protection from 
creditors in a Federal Bankruptcy Court under Chapter 11. This action came 
despite the Sockers' status as one of the most successful franchises in league 
history. 
</P>
<P>
2. They come back, but Segota goes. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 7 of the Western Division finals on May 28, Branko Segota, the Sockers' 
leading scorer, injured his shoulder and was lost for the remainder of the 
playoffs. The Sockers advanced to the MISL Championship Series against the 
Cleveland Force without him, beating the Kansas City Comets, 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
There was a sign the Kansas City series would be bizarre in Game 3, when the 
Sockers blew a 6-1 lead in the fourth quarter and lost in overtime, 7-6. Kansas 
City had a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series before the Sockers rallied. 
</P>
<P>
3. Break up the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
The great all-star Sockers team of the 1980s played its last game together on 
June 7 and produced a 7-4 victory over Cleveland, wrapping up a four-game sweep 
of the MISL Championship Series and a sixth title in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Because of salary cutbacks, it was apparent that players such as Segota, Juli 
Veee, Hugo Perez, Kevin Crow, Fernando Clavijo, Zoltan Toth and Jim Gorsek 
would not all be able to come back for another season. 
</P>
<P>
But Cleveland saw the Sockers at their best in the final game. Waad Hirmez 
notched a hat trick, and Perez broke a 4-4 tie with 3:34 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
4. Fowler makes his bid ... 
</P>
<P>
After it became obvious that nobody else was interested in buying the 
franchise, Fowler announced an offer to buy it out of bankruptcy for $825,000 
on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler's bid was eventually lowered to $470,000. He will also threatened to 
withdraw it on June 29. 
</P>
<P>
5. . . . but on second thought . . . 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of July 8, Fowler arrived in court and was told by local 
reporter that the Tacoma Stars and Chicago Sting had folded, leaving the league 
with seven franchises. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who maintained all along that the league must have at least eight 
franchises to exist, called a press conference that afternoon and announced 
that soccer in San Diego was pretty much dead. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a week later, a group in Tacoma announced that it was going to try 
and re-start the Stars. So Fowler kept his offer alive. 
</P>
<P>
Tacoma was eventually re-started, but Cleveland folded on July 22. After a 
weekend's worth of meetings, the league decided to try another season with 
seven teams. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who had come this far, elected to stick it out, and his second bid is 
accepted by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter W. Bowie on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
6. Back to soccer. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 5, after the team's most tumultuous off-season, the Sockers opened 
their 1988-89 season against the Los Angeles Lazers. Gone were Gorsek, Hirmez, 
Veee, Perez, Clavijo, Brian Schmetzer, Raffaele Ruotolo and Jacques Ladouceur. 
</P>
<P>
As if to put on exclamation point on the summer's activities, ex-Sockers Hirmez 
and Gorsek led the Lazers to a 5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 22, the Sockers signed Steve Zungul, the top scorer in the history of 
the game. Reunited with Segota, Zungul goes on a scoring spree (six goals in 
his first six games) and the Sockers are 7-7 going into the New Year. CHRIS

With apologies to David Letterman, we offer lists detailing what happened in 
1988 and, in some cases, how 1988 will impact 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything else you wanted to know about but were afraid to ask: 
</P>
<P>
1. A Pair for Pate. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Pate thought San Diego was a great golf town. 
</P>
<P>
On windy Sunday Jan. 17, after three delays because of rain and one because of 
hail, the Tournament of Champions was called off, and Pate was declared the 
winner after 54 holes at La Costa. Pate was awarded the $90,000 first prize for 
his 14-under-par score of 202, one stroke better than Larry Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 21, Pate sank a 6-foot putt for a birdie on the final hole for a 
1-stroke victory over Jay Haas in the Shearson Lehman Hutton Andy Williams Open 
at Torrey Pines Golf Course. Pate became only the second golfer to win the San 
Diego double -- the T of C and the Andy Williams. (Tom Watson did it in 1980.) 
Pate's putt gave him a final round of 68 and a 72-hole total of 19-under par 
269. 
</P>
<P>
Pate also will be the last Andy Williams winner. After a 21-year affiliation, 
the Century Club of San Diego announced Nov. 22 that Williams has ended his 
involvement as host of the tournament. It will now be known as the Shearson 
Lehman Hutton Open. 
</P>
<P>
2. The meet belongs to Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
A host of track and field stars showed up at the Michelob Invitational outdoor 
track meet in June. 
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee took just three long jumps. 
Two were fouls, but her first -- 24 feet 3 inches -- was just 2 1/2 inches 
short of her American record. After competing, Joyner-Kersee attended the 
wedding of UCLA's Gail Devers, formerly of Sweetwater, and Ron Roberts, a 
former Bruin distance runner. 
</P>
<P>
Florence Griffith Joyner -- Flo Jo -- gave an indication of Olympic glory to 
come, winning the 100 meters in 10.89 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Decker Slaney had an easy time in the 2,000 meters, winning in 5 minutes 
36.35 seconds. Ramona Pagel became the first American woman to surpass 20 
meters in the shot put with a throw of 66-2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
3. And the rest of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joan Hansen, a Solana Beach distance runner, decided not to try to compete 
in her second Olympics in 1988, opting instead to help start the San Diego 
National Athletes Fund, a nonprofit corporation designed to raise money for 
local athletes in training. In '84, Hansen ran in the 3,000-meter race with 
Mary Decker. Both fell, but few knew about Hansen because of the controversy 
surrounding Decker, who didn't finish. Hansen did, placing eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Major League Volleyball was a major league bust in May. Just 254 fans 
showed up for a match between the New York Liberties and the Chicago Breeze. 
The Breeze won. The MLV lost. The paltry attendance figures didn't entice San 
Diego investors to support a team here. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In June, it was announced that San Diego State and USD would not play each 
other in men's basketball for the first time in 9 years. The rivalry was put on 
hold for a year because the two schools could not agree on a date. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An estimated 3,000 athletes descended on San Diego to participate in 13 
sports at 25 venues in the inaugural California State Games in mid July. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the men's open division championship of the 35th Over-the-Line 
tournament at Fiesta Island July 17, the Beachcomber team of Steve Miner, Billy 
Bright and John Torchia came out of the loser's bracket to defeat the Pennant 
Pups for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Christy Erb of Bonita and Kevin Kemp of Greensboro, N.C. won the girls' and 
boys' 15-17 divisions of the Optimist Junior World Golf Championships at Torrey 
Pines July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With 8 seconds to play and the game tied, 14-14, Torrey Pines fullback Tim 
Walker kicked a 39-yard field goal to give the San Diego Section All-Stars a 
17-14 victory over the Los Angeles City Section team at Mesa College July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roger Gunn of Napa won the Buie San Diego County Open with a 6-under-par-66 
on the North Course at Torrey Pines Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stephanie Rehe breezed by Ann Grossman, 6-1, 6-1, to win the Virginia Slims 
of San Diego singles title Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some top names were missing Aug. 12, but after a 4-year hiatus, the NBA 
returned to the San Diego Sports Arena for an all-star game that included 
former Aztec Michael Cage and Morse High alumnus Cliff Levingston (35 points, 
MVP). 
</P>
<P>
 -- A local all-star team returned home in mid August after winning the 
International Boys' Baseball Friendship Tournament in Bejing, China. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Dodd, who attended SDSU, and Tim Hovland won $50,000 in the Cuervo 
Gold Crown volleyball series Sept. 17 at Mission Bay's Mariner's Point. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two drivers in the championship race of the Miller High Life Thunderboat 
Regatta at Mission Bay Sept. 18 escaped serious injury when the 
turbine/jet-powered hydroplanes boats they were racing flipped over and broke 
apart after being launched by a gust of wind. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wayne Gretzky had a goal and an assist for the Los Angeles Kings, who lost, 
5-4, to the Winnipeg Jets in an exhibition before a sellout crowd of 13,155 at 
the Sports Arena Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut was the first gymnast inducted into the 
International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in Oceanside on Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rockers Bobby Blotzer of Ratt, "Motor City Madman" Ted Nugent and Tommy Lee 
of Motley Crue finished 1-2-3 in the Dodge International Star Challenge car 
race on Oct. 22 at the Del Mar Fairgrounds. The next day, Tom Hessert won the 
championship race of the Camel Grand Prix of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former world record-holder and 2-time Olympian Tom Petranoff of Oceanside, 
along with several other track and field athletes, was suspended indefinitely 
by The Athletics Congress for participation in a series of meets in South 
Africa. TAC serves as the U.S. agent of the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation, which does not sanction meets in South Africa because of that 
government's official policy of racial separation. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, and DON

CHINO ENDS POINT LOMA'S HOME WINNING STREAK AT 143 GAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
There is nothing discrete about the state championship banners that hang in the 
high school gym at Point Loma High. The four gold-and-maroon flags represent, 
in part, the accomplishments of the Pointer girls' basketball teams, which 
until Saturday afternoon had won 143 consecutive games there. 
</P>
<P>
But Chino (12-0), the defending Southern Section 2-A champion from the Baseline 
League in Pomona Valley, wasn't intimidated by the banners, the streak or the 
gym and said so in a resounding 50-39 victory for the championship of the Ben 
Fisher tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"They have those four banners hanging here," Chino Coach Joe Murillo said. "We 
wanted to see what it would be like to come down here and play a ranked team." 
</P>
<P>
They found out. Using a zone defense to negate Point Loma's speed, Chino was 
able to curtail the scoring of Monica Filer and Tyeast Brown, who were held to 
6 and 11 points, respectively. Sophomore Chris Drumm led the Pointers with 15, 
including a fourth-quarter 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't match up with them," Point Loma Coach Lee Trepanier said. 
"Big people wear you down, and they did a good job of it." 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma's tallest player is Brown at 5-feet 11-inches. Chino has four 
players who are taller than 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tall," Murillo said. "Sometimes the kids don't realize we can take 
advantage of that. In the third quarter, we started taking advantage of our 
size." 
</P>
<P>
The third quarter proved to be Point Loma's undoing. The Pointers had leads of 
14-12 after a quarter and 22-21 at halftime, but Chino came out and outscored 
Point Loma, 14-6, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma was also hurt by its free-throw shooting. The Pointers were just 4 
of 10 from the line. 
</P>
<P>
With the loss, Point Loma must start another winning streak from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
"Records are made to be broken," Trepanier said. "So now we start a new one. 
You don't get better if you don't play better teams, and we're still the best 
team in San Diego County." 
</P>
<P>
Felicia Franke and Francine Moreno led Chino with 22 and 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Poway 56, Oceanside 39 -- Dawn Gigstad and Julie Schwan each scored 12 as Poway 
took third place. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry 49, Bonita Vista 36 -- Bonita Vista was able to stay within six 
points of Patrick Henry until the fourth quarter, when several turnovers cost 
the Barons in the fifth-place game. The Patriots outscored Bonita Vista, 19-10, 
in the final quarter. Rochelle Johnson (23) and Sorii Epps (14) combined for 37 
of Patrick Henry's points. Johnson also was the leading rebounder with 17. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos 43, Chula Vista 35 -- San Marcos (4-1 in the tournament, 5-5 
overall) led, 28-15, at halftime but lost some momentum when the game's leading 
scorer, Susie O'Brien (20) collected her fourth foul and left at the start of 
the third quarter. Chula Vista pulled within 38-35, but with 6 minutes 
remaining, O'Brien returned and San Marcos pulled away to take seventh place.

AZTECS TAKE LOW-KEY ROAD, BUT GET BY VERMONT

SAN DIEGO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vermont certainly is not North Carolina. The first clue came midway through the 
first half of Saturday's Vermont-San Diego State basketball game, when a 
Catamount pass on a fast-break attempt catapulted out of bounds off a Catamount 
head. 
</P>
<P>
The second clue came early in the second half. SDSU was leading by five with 
17:47 left when Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg called a timeout. Shawn Bell -- in 
the midst of his best game at San Diego State -- walked to the bench and looked 
at the scoreboard. Then he yawned. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs won, 83-76, but the atmosphere in the San Diego Sports Arena wasn't 
exactly as festive as Thursday's 103-92 loss to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have rather been in a dental chair with no novocaine than endure that 
for 40 minutes," was the way Brandenburg explained it. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,529, the fewest to attend an Aztec home game since 836 watched 
SDSU play Hawaii in the final game of the 1986-1987 season, watched SDSU 
improve to 6-4. Against North Carolina, the Aztecs had set a home attendance 
record of 13,106. 
</P>
<P>
The fallout from the empty arena reached the court, where it was so quiet you 
could hear the ball drop. SDSU had 21 turnovers and Vermont 18. Both teams shot 
48% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"And my New Year's resolution was to not take another drink all year long," 
Brandenburg said. "But I think (the letdown) was very evident -- and 
predictable. We were tremendously emotionally high Thursday, and when you get 
that high, you valley out. We valleyed out really bad." 
</P>
<P>
One of the spectators at the North Carolina game was on the Vermont bench 
Saturday, and Tom Brennan, the Catamount coach, got exactly what he had hoped 
for. 
</P>
<P>
"We caught them at the right time," said Brennan, whose team is 1-5 and has 
lost 10 consecutive road games. "After playing in front of 13,000 rockin' and 
rollin' fans Thursday, and then to play in front of (something like) 13 . . . I 
kept saying 'stay ahead, stay ahead' (to the Aztecs) Thursday because I knew 
there had to be an emotional letdown." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, a transfer from Chicago State, finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds -- 
both personal bests at SDSU. Guard Tony Ross had a season-high 23 points, and 
his four second-half 3-pointers (he had five total) sparked the listless Aztecs 
enough to stop a handful of Vermont comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs built a 12-point halftime lead, 38-26, as Bell surpassed his 
9.8-point scoring average with 15. Vermont whittled it down to five, 40-35, 
just 2 minutes into the second half and eventually cut it to three, 52-49, with 
12:09 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
It was 55-51 with 10:38 left, but Ross made three 3-pointers in the next 3:24 
to give SDSU some room to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
"Shawn and Tony came through for us when everyone else was really struggling," 
Brandenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brennan: "Ross and Bell were great tonight." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU guard Bryan Williams wasn't bad, either. He had 9 assists, giving him 19 
for the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to get up for this game, but a lot of people were tired," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Aztec center Mitch McMullen: "It was a win. You've got to take every one 
you can get." 
</P>
<P>
McMullen, who had career highs of 29 points and 12 rebounds against North 
Carolina, managed just 10 points and 5 rebounds before fouling out with 2:41 to 
play. Joe Calavita led Vermont with 20 points.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: RECORD-SETTING EFFORTS LEAD CHRISTIAN HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two records fell, and the Christian Heritage men's basketball team scored 21 
points in overtime to defeat Point Loma Nazarene College, 123-114, Saturday 
night at Granite Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
In his first game for Christian Heritage, junior forward Brad Soucie, a 
transfer from Eastern Michigan, scored 46 points and broke the single-game 
school record (33) set last year by his brother, senior forward Bill. Brad 
Soucie, who also holds the NCAA Division I playoff record for the most 3-point 
goals in a game (8) had six 3-pointers against the Crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Kraatz had 19 assists to break the school record he set last year. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage (10-2) now has the best record in NAIA District 3 after its 
second victory this year over Point Loma Nazarene (2-8). Christian Heritage 
evened its all-time mark against PLNC at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Regulation ended at 102-102. 
</P>
<P>
Will Cunningham had 20 points and Kraatz added 17 for the winning Hawks. Mark 
Ryan and Mark Bulgin led Point Loma Nazarene with 35 and 26 points. Bulgin had 
four 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks were 43 of 67 from the field and 28 of 37 from the foul line. Point 
Loma Nazarene was 44 of 82 from the field, 15 of 22 in free throws. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
U.S. International University (2-10) lost its ninth in a row, 84-74, to 
Missouri at the Larry Lawrence Community Center in La Jolla. USIU had an 18-10 
lead early but was tied at 31-31 on a 16-foot shot by Missouri's Marcia Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Sonia Carter scored 30 points for USIU. 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego lost, 73-59, to Murray State at the USD Sports 
Center. Rochelle Lightner and Paula Mascari each scored 12 points for USD 
(3-5). Sheila Smith scored 24 for Murray State (9-1). 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego seniors Laurie Bertanyi and Ellen Chi were named to the college 
division first team of the 1988 GTE Academic All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Bertanyi and Chi were among 39 athletes named to the three academic teams in 
university and college divisions. To qualify, an athlete must be a varsity 
starter or key reserve and maintain a cumulative 3.2 grade point average. 
</P>
<P>
Bertanyi, a setter from Santa Barbara, is a biochemistry major and has a 3.74 
GPA. Chi, also a biochemistry major, is from Downey and maintains a 3.84 GPA.

Was 1988 the year of the dead in the Orange County arts scene? Well, it was the 
year Pacific Symphony conductor Keith Clark was termed "a dead fish," the year 
William Shakespeare was nearly a dead duck in Garden Grove and the year the 
rock zanies in Oingo Boingo held yet another "Dead Man's Party" at Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Jokes notwithstanding, there were encouraging signs of life locally. South 
Coast Repertory Theatre won major national recognition with the 1988 Tony Award 
as best regional theater in the country. The Grove Theatre Co. triumphed over 
considerable civic adversity that threatened for a time to shut down the 
county's only annual Shakespeare festival. The Pacific Symphony demonstrated 
new enthusiasm, with concerts led by guest conductors vying for the 
soon-to-be-vacated music director post. 
</P>
<P>
Local rock bands seemed to flourish, live and on record, despite a paucity of 
clubs in the county that would book them or radio stations that would air their 
music. The Improv in Irvine paved the way for a significant increase in the 
quantity and quality of stand-up comedy in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, in the following four pages critics for The Times Orange 
County Edition offer compendiums of the best -- and in some cases, the worst 
and the silliest -- that the county had to offer during the year in art, music, 
dance, theater, pop and comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 *"Chris Burden: A 20-Year Survey," at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. Orange 
County's major art exhibition of 1988, a massive display of prickly and 
sometimes downright ornery works that are ultimately revelatory of a 
continually questioning, first-rate mind. 
</P>
<P>
*"The Figurative Fifties," at Newport Harbor. Another major show, conceptually 
not as strong as it might have been but with important work on paper by Willem 
de Kooning and terrifically ebullient pieces by the likes of Larry Rivers, 
Grace Hartigan and George McNeil. 
</P>
<P>
*"The Early Works of Charles E. Burchfield," at the Laguna Art Museum. The 
year's most enjoyable historical show, with passionate, idiosyncratic paintings 
by an American original. 
</P>
<P>
*Works from the Pauline Hirsh collection at Laguna Art Museum and the museum's 
South Coast Plaza annex. Provocative early pieces by several mostly 
lesser-known contemporary artists. 
</P>
<P>
*The Lorrin and Deane Wong collection at the Art Institute of Southern 
California. Pieces by important contemporary American and European artists, 
many of whom have never shown in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
*"Bare Facts, Sly Humor," at the Irvine Fine Arts Center and "Suburban Visions, 
Middle-Class Dreams," at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton. Recent 
unconventional work in photography and a timely subject illustrated with some 
wonderfully quirky picks. Both of these shows were part of "Photography: Inside 
Out," a countywide series of exhibits that helped boost the level of community 
art center offerings this year. 
</P>
<P>
* Angie Bray's "Night Lies" installation at BC Space in Laguna Beach: An 
installation tapping 
</P>
<P>
deep psychological veins via artlessly simple means, and also very possibly a 
breakthrough for the Laguna Beach artist. 
</P>
<P>
*"Inside Out" at BC Space. Shattering images and voices of the mentally ill 
imprisoned in a locked ward (by Mary Ellen Mark) or trying to make it on their 
own in the "real" world (by Lonnie Shavelson) -- surely the year's most 
significant show addressing a major social issue. CATHY CURTIS

</P>
<P>
 *International star Fernando Bujones danced Lensky in John Cranko's "Onegin" 
as a guest with the National Ballet of Canada, June 7 to 12, at the Center. But 
the company was not lacking in its own roster of dancers. Among a trio of 
casts, Sabina Allemann was a most lyric, expressive Tatiana, and Frank Augustyn 
a cold, world-weary Onegin. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadians also brought Glen Tetley's "Alice," with Kimberly Glasco as a 
melting Young Alice and Rex Harrington as a Byronic Lewis Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
As a curtain-raiser, the company danced no less than Balanchine's profound "The 
Four Temperaments" -- and danced it superbly. 
</P>
<P>
*Merche Esmeralda brought demonic power, shattering intensity to "Medea" during 
the Royal Spanish National Ballet run at the Center, Aug. 2 to 7. 
</P>
<P>
*American Ballet Theatre unveiled a costly new staging of "Swan Lake" by 
company artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov during its Nov. 29 to Dec. 11 run 
at the Center. Five pairs of Swan Queens and Siegfrieds danced in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
ABT excelled in Balanchine's masterpiece, "Stravinsky Violin Concerto." 
</P>
<P>
Also during ABT's run, three former members of Twyla Tharp Dance company (Kevin 
O'Day, Jamie Bishton and Daniel Sanchez) -- folded into the New York company 
now that Tharp is artistic associate of ABT -- appeared in her inventive, 
virtuoso "The Fugue," danced to silence. 
</P>
<P>
*The dance department at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa sponsored two dance 
and music events in October and netted about $3,000 to benefit ACTION (AIDS 
Coalition to Identify Orange County Needs), a 4-year-old grass-roots 
organization that provides educational services and coordinates informational 
meetings for the public, among other aims. 
</P>
<P>
Participating groups included Rhapsody in Taps (formerly LTD/Dance Unlimited), 
the Gloria Newman Dance Theatre, Ecos de Espana, Middle Eastern dancer Angelika 
Nemeth and composer Lisbeth Woodies. CHRIS PASLES

UTILITY SUES IN THEFT OF POWER

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. filed a $500,000 lawsuit against a Lakeside 
couple for allegedly stealing more than $40,000 worth of gas and electricity 
from the utility over three years. Beth Eagleson, SDG&amp;E's corporate 
attorney, said Friday that the suit against Jerry P. and Cathy A. Goulart seeks 
to recover punitive damages and about $42,500 worth of energy stolen from the 
utility. "Based upon measurement of actual use compared to their load 
information, a back bill for gas and electric service was prepared," Eagleson 
said. According to company spokesman Dave Smith, load information refers to the 
energy used by household appliances. The law allows utilities to try to recover 
the cost of stolen electricity, plus treble damages. In this case, Eagleson 
said, that amounts to $127,789.50. In addition, she said, SDG&amp;E is seeking 
$300,000 in punitive damages. Eagleson did not say how the Goularts' case was 
discovered. According to the San Diego County district attorney's office, 
criminal charges are also involved. In addition to fiscal penalties, Eagleson 
said, "It's important to remember that energy diversion is also dangerous."

1988: A HUMBLING YEAR FOR THE MIGHTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Orange County in 1988, the natural disasters were few. The human misfortunes 
were many. 
</P>
<P>
The ground didn't shake too much, and even the drought-parched canyons did not 
ignite. True, there was the winter storm early in the year that caused the 
newly rebuilt Huntington Beach Pier to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
But that was nothing compared to the collapse of careers and the tumbling of 
stature among many of the county's once-towering figures. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year that the mighty fell: 
</P>
<P>
* A rising star in the Republican Party plummeted when he forged a signature on 
a check in a last-ditch effort to bail out his campaign for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
* A millionaire video producer from Newport Beach was charged with making 
illegal campaign contributions to failed Democratic presidential hopeful Gary 
Hart and other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
* An Orange County supervisor, running for Congress, was caught red-faced when 
it was revealed that she did not graduate from college, as her biographies 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
* Even the always-powerful Orange County Republican Party took it on the chin 
when it posted uniformed security guards at polling places in Latino areas of 
Santa Ana to warn non-citizens not to vote, prompting an FBI investigation into 
allegations of voter intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, 1988 was the election year that many people would like to forget. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the venerable Rep. Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach), a six-term 
congressman, surprised supporters by announcing that he would not run for 
reelection, which opened the door to a free-for-all that led to a promising 
young politician's demise. 
</P>
<P>
C. David Baker, Irvine city councilman and former college basketball star, 
seemed to be the heir-apparent to Badham's seat until C. Christopher Cox gave 
him a run for his money in the June primary. And when that money began to run 
short in the final days before the election, a desperate Baker turned to the 
bank account of a nonprofit health foundation that he directed for an advance 
on a loan that was a few days late. He wrote a $48,000 check to himself, 
signing his own name and forging the signature of a judge, a foundation 
director. He stopped payment on the check shortly after it was written, but the 
damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who was narrowly defeated by Cox, pleaded guilty to a felony forgery 
count, but a Superior Court judge later reduced the charge to a misdemeanor. 
The judge ordered Baker to perform community service and gave him a year's 
probation and a 1-year suspended jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what the penalty was today, this will not be over," Baker said 
on the day he was sentenced. Even when the sentence was imposed, Baker was 
delivering hot meals to the elderly and working with children. "Some good will 
come out of this one way or another. I'm not really sure how." 
</P>
<P>
Another legislative seat unexpectedly opened with the death of Assemblyman 
Richard E. Longshore (R-Santa Ana) the day after voters nominated him for a 
second term. 
</P>
<P>
That opened up a king-sized contest between Republicans and Democrats for his 
seat, and that race, too, led to a finish-line stumble. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent Out the Guards 
</P>
<P>
In their fervor to see their candidate, Curt Pringle, win, county Republican 
Party officials not only got out the vote on Nov. 8, they also sent out the 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
Uniformed security guards were hired by the party to stand watch at heavily 
Latino polling places to warn people that it was illegal for non-citizens to 
vote. The Democrats cried foul, and even high-ranking Republicans denounced the 
move. The FBI and district attorney's office are now investigating whether 
election laws were violated, and several Latino and labor organizations have 
filed suit to overturn the election results in the 72nd Assembly District, 
where Pringle ended up winning by a mere 867 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder's election foibles left her with a red face. 
Running for Congress in the June primary, Wieder conceded under pressure from 
her opponent that she had left uncorrected a 25-year-old error on her biography 
that stated she had received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Wayne State 
University in Detroit. In truth, she was unable to attend college because of 
family finances. Also under fire from slow-growth advocates for her votes on 
development agreements, Wieder lost the race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Karl Stubbed His Toe 
</P>
<P>
Republicans did not have a monopoly on election-year problems. Stuart Karl Jr., 
the millionaire producer of the Jane Fonda workout tapes, was fined $60,000 and 
placed on 3 years' probation for making $185,000 in illegal campaign 
contributions to self-destructing presidential candidate Gary Hart and others. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I'm not sure why I did these things," Karl said after his 
sentencing. "You're attracted to the lure of being involved. People begin to 
make you feel important. I should have looked deeper and not done the things I 
did. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Hamburger magnate Carl N. Karcher also took a tumble. Known for his fast food 
and patriotism, the founder of Carl's Jr. restaurants was accused by the 
federal government of insider trading, for allegedly tipping off his relatives 
about some bad news that his company was about to release. While a federal 
judge has ruled that Karcher's son, Carl Leo Karcher, did engage in the illegal 
behavior, the case against the senior Karcher is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
"These charges are totally false," Karcher said after the civil lawsuit was 
filed in April. "My wife and I did not sell any of our stock, nor did we tell 
anyone else to do so. . . . To suggest that any of us would intentionally 
violate the securities laws is highly offensive."

Crystal Cathedral Cutback 
</P>
<P>
Even God's squad was taken down a notch or two in 1988. While televangelist 
Robert H. Schuller stayed clear of the scandals that rocked his collared 
colleagues, the fallout hit the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. In May, 
Schuller announced sharp cutbacks in his "Hour of Power" broadcast ministry, a 
result of reduced contributions because of televangelism scandal "shock waves," 
the October, 1987, stock market crash and the decision by a New York City cable 
television station to eliminate paid religious programming. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not everyone had a bad 1988. Braving the Siberian cold, marathon swimmer 
Lynne Cox of Los Alamitos became the first person to navigate a significant 
distance across the Soviet Union's Lake Baikal, the world's deepest lake. 
America's darling and Placentia's own Janet Evans won three gold medals in the 
pool at the Summer Olympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the misfortunes of other politicians, two former White House aides 
were launched on promising careers. Cox, after toughing it out with Baker in 
the congressional primary, sailed to easy victory in November. Dana 
Rohrabacher, after tipping off voters to Wieder's erroneous resume, was elected 
to the 42nd Congressional District post that was vacated by Daniel E. Lungren 
(R-Long Beach), who tried -- and failed -- to become the state's treasurer.

</P>
<P>
Political Comeback 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was perhaps no bigger political comeback in Orange County in 1988 
than the one that took place on a gentle hillside in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
The honoree was not able to attend, but hundreds of supporters gathered to 
watch a bulldozer scrape up the first bucket of dirt where a library soon will 
stand to house the papers and mementos of Orange County's native son and the 
nation's only resigned president, Richard M. Nixon.

development, was defeated 55.7% to 44.3% in the June 7 primary. The initiative 
had been favored in early, pre-primary polls, but growth proponents, who 
collected and spent nearly $2 million, poured it on as the election neared. 
Those favoring growth controls spent little and campaigned less for the failed 
measure. MARK BOSTER / Los Angeles Times; Photo, Anaheim Motorcycle Officer

Jan. 18. Plans are for the pier to be rebuilt, reopening possibly in the spring 
of 1991. KEN HIVELY / Los Angeles Times; Photo, A crowd of 1,500 gathered in

1988 THE YEAR IN REVIEW;

NONPARTISAN LOCAL ELECTIONS: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our readers wrote letters throughout 1988 expressing their viewpoints on a 
variety of issues. Here are condensed versions of some of those letters. We 
appreciate their taking the time to share their viewpoints and look forward to 
hearing from you in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo's elections were marked by an evil partisanship that destroys 
the fabric of a local community. There are many very good reasons that city 
councils, supervisors, school boards, judges, city attorneys and planning 
commissions should not be elected on a national political party basis. 
</P>
<P>
The chief rationale is that the issues they decide involve quasi-judicial 
functions and executive-legislative interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
Neither party serves the local constituency well by attempting to influence the 
voter to vote along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
The motivation is purely selfish and defeats the essence of local control. The 
issues are essentially nonpartisan.

Pamela Dilday-Davis on leash laws: 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach police have finally caught up with me. After a year of 
reckless disregard for the law, I was cited recently for walking my dog off the 
leash. I have difficulty with the leash law, which dictates that all dogs, even 
those with no criminal record, have to be restrained when outdoors. No such law 
pertains to the roving gangs of tough cats. The officer allowed that he thought 
it was indeed a shame that dogs in Newport Beach had no place to run free. I 
don't walk Sophie without a leash anymore. I'd like to say that I've been 
rehabilitated. But every once in a while, when it's dark and no one can see us, 
the old urge to run free takes hold, and we're off on another crime spree in 
the streets of Newport Beach.

Donald A. Sizemore on the homeless: 
</P>
<P>
For all our concern with morality we are confronted daily with an immense evil 
that few seem to care about and fewer still seek to halt. That evil is 
homelessness in Orange County, and its companions: poverty, illness and hunger. 
For most, accustomed to our county's image of prosperity, it is virtually 
impossible to believe that thousands of Orange County residents are living in 
conditions reminiscent of the Appalachia of 3 decades ago. For the few who 
become aware of this issue there is always the comfortable lie that the poor 
deserve their rags, malnutrition and loss of dignity. The truth is a horrifying 
indictment of Orange County's values and priorities -- both public and private. 
It takes only $4 a day to shelter, feed and assist the homeless. The issue is 
seldom a lack of resources -- it is usually lack of concern, leadership or, in 
a very real sense, a lack of morality when it comes to the poor.

David Camplin on drug use: 
</P>
<P>
I see the problem every day I'm in school. Friends ditch school to go to the 
beach and do drugs. Friends skip class and go to a field to smoke a quick 
joint. People in my classes sell paraphernalia as well as the drugs right in 
class. I see kids destroying their lives with such substances as pot, cocaine, 
crack, acid, speed and many other drugs. We've got to wage a war against drug 
abuse. Some users just need someone to accept them and be their friend -- 
outside of the drug circles. We need to care enough to listen and be willing to 
help them. If drug users do not respond to that we need to inform as many 
authorities as necessary to get the person off drugs. I've seen some beautiful 
lives produced from horrible ones because they were forced into programs.

Jerry Collins on new fatherhood: 
</P>
<P>
Life doesn't begin at 55, but it sure can take a fresh turn. It has for me . I 
have a baby son. It's an odd feeling being a father again. A daughter, 25, a 
son, 18, and a baby. I must take note of the change in the delivery process. 
Back in the '60s, husbands had little to do with it. It was a mother's affair, 
and the doctor's business. The husband's principal task was to stay out of the 
way -- just get mom to the hospital in time. This time I was there. In the 
delivery room, actually being helpful. The years and the participation in the 
delivery have given me new perspective on new little human beings. I look upon 
them for what they are, not what they will be. They are struggling, curious, 
funny and courageous. Little things mean a lot to them. Children are children. 
They are not, nor should they ever be expected to be, small adults. Twenty 
years ago, it couldn't have been this way. Fathers felt foolish pushing their 
babies along in strollers, or sharing a rattle with them in a public park. Not 
today. Fathers may now feel a little clumsy, but not foolish. That's the way it 
is with Jeremy and me.

 In every survey of Orange County issues and in every poll of attitudes, 
transportation and traffic congestion consistently emerge as the No. 1 concern 
on people's minds today. But we don't need polls and surveys to tell us traffic 
is a problem. And we can all feel the frustrations of thinking that no one, 
anywhere, is doing anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
Well, some positive things are being done: widening the San Diego Freeway, 
rebuilding the aged Santa Ana-Costa Mesa freeways interchange and lengthening 
the Costa Mesa Freeway past the Orange County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
These freeway improvements are only one part of our energetic effort to meet 
our transportation problems head-on. New transportation facilities are needed. 
More flexible work hours, more ride-sharing and other transportation-management 
techniques are on tap.

 To vote or not to vote? That was the question Orange County voters faced Nov. 
8. That question became difficult in the 72nd Assembly District when the Orange 
County Republican Party sent uniformed security guards to 20 Santa Ana 
precincts to intimidate Hispanic voters. 
</P>
<P>
As a registered Republican, even I am amazed at how bold our leaders have 
become. Our elective process is founded on the principle that the voter not be 
intimidated at the ballot box. Not since the 1960s have such tactics been used. 
They were unjust then, and they are outrageously unjust now.

 Let's look at growth in Orange County as if we all had a stake in tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
One way or another, our children are going to pay for the countless ills 
brought about by unwise development. There's still time, however, to move into 
the next century with style. 
</P>
<P>
Let's work together to find ways to preserve open space and recreation land, to 
develop affordable housing, to create jobs, to control traffic and to improve 
the quality of life. Nuts to those of limited vision who would surrender our 
future to past mistakes.

Orange County. I opened up the newspaper and read, among other things, that the 
average Orange County home price is $175,000, highest in the nation. It is no 
wonder that the middle-class dream of owning a home is now out of reach for 
most young Orange County families. I'm a case in point. Before moving we lived 
in a two-bedroom apartment in Westminster for $610 a month. I accepted a job in 
Denver. We moved into a brand new three-bedroom, two-story home. It includes a 
yard, a full basement and a view of the mountains. We bought the house for 
$110,000 at a 7.8% fixed, 30-year mortgage rate. A staffing manager who 
recruits professional workers for my new company told me that the richest pool 
of engineers is in Southern California -- it's easy to lure them away because 
of the high cost of housing.

We want Janet. 
</P>
<P>
We want Janet shampoo (She cleaned up at Seoul, now she wants to clean up your 
scalp), we want Janet toothpaste (She'll do to your plaque what she did to the 
East Germans) and we want Janet Cliff Notes (When gold medals get in the way of 
The Great Gatsby). We want Janet-Jammies, we want JANET-LAND and yes, we want 
our JTV. 
</P>
<P>
We want Janet Evans in our newspapers and magazines, on our coffee tables and 
television screens. We want Janet because she's the best, the brightest and 
because she giggles after she wins Olympic gold medals, sets swimming world 
records or eats pizza. 
</P>
<P>
We want Janet Evans so badly that when she returned home to Placentia after 
winning three gold medals (400-meter individual medley, 400- and 800-freestyle) 
during the Seoul Summer Olympics, we practically chased her back to South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Television cameras, still photographers, newspaper reporters, magazine writers, 
TV personalities. And that was just Day 1. Taking in the crush of media-types 
onto Placentia's El Dorado High School, where Evans is a senior and reigning 
homecoming queen, classmate Shane Borowski said, "We all feel sorry for her. I 
mean, look at that." 
</P>
<P>
Evans claimed she wanted to be "Just Janet," but her commercial value has been 
assessed in mega-bucks. Still, she's balked at signing professional 
endorsements, choosing to search for a semblance of a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck. At age 17, Janet Evans was Orange County's top sports story of 1988. 
The 105-pound girl from Placentia was bigger than the play-dead Angels and 
their amazing revolving managers (Mauch-to-Cookie-to-Moose-to-Rader). 
</P>
<P>
Bigger than the Rams, whose Super Bowl hopes got as far as a wild-card game in 
Minnesota. That's where they lost under climatic conditions usually reserved 
for better shops and department stores. 
</P>
<P>
She made a bigger splash than Lynne Cox, who swam a Russian lake in search of a 
different kind of medal. (What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?) 
She was a bigger hit than Angel catcher Bob Boone, who had his best year 
batting and then bolted the Angels for the Kansas City Royals for just one 
dollar more than he earned with the Angels in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Evans headed an amazing army of Orange County athletes under 21 years of age 
who showed up their elders during the year. Placentia's Michael Chang, 16, 
became the youngest male to win a singles match at Wimbledon and went on to 
become, along with Andre Agassi, the next great hope for American tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia's Michele Granger, 18, now a freshman at California, was recognized 
as the world's greatest softball pitcher, setting a dizzying array of national 
softball pitching records while at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
There was Servite High's Derek Brown, 17, who set the county single-season 
rushing record and University of Houston running back Chuck Weatherspoon, 20, a 
La Habra High alumnus who rushed for 1,005 yards and led the nation in yards 
per carry (8.5). 
</P>
<P>
There were Elaine Youngs (El Toro), Jenny Evans (Newport Harbor) and Laurie 
Jones (Huntington Beach) who, as freshmen, played major roles on the UCLA 
women's volleyball team that went 34-0 before losing in the semifinals of the 
NCAA championships. Bob Hamelin, at age 20, batted .514 for Rancho Santiago 
College and hit a state-record 31 home runs and 105 RBIs in 48 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Mater Dei boys' basketball team won its fourth consecutive 5-A championship 
despite recruiting allegations made against its athletic programs and the 
team's failure to win the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar High, with an enrollment of only 1,400, won Southern Section 
championships in girls' track, girls' tennis, water polo, football and a state 
championship in boys' cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine High girls' volleyball team won its second straight state 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The grownups' table -- filled with resignations, firings, disappointment and 
guys named Moose -- did have some bright spots. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Louganis of the Mission Viejo Nadadores became the first male to sweep 
gold medals in diving in two Olympics. Newport Harbor's Greg Barton won two 
gold medals in kayaking during the Summer Olympics, becoming the first American 
to win a gold medal in singles kayaking. The Rams' Jim Everett set team 
single-season records for pass completions, yards and touchdowns. Receiver 
Henry Ellard set a season record for receptions. The Angels' Johnny Ray was an 
All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, it was the kids who were more than all right in 1988. And leading 
the way were . . . 
</P>
<P>
NOT JUST JANET ANYMORE 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Troup, director of U.S. Swimming Inc., had tested more than 1,000 
swimmers for energy efficiency when he came across Janet Evans. After testing 
her prior to the Summer Games, he proclaimed Evans the most energy efficient 
"male or female" swimmer today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll stop short of saying Janet's a fish," said Troup, in a Sports Illustrated 
article, "but physiologically she's very similar." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever she was, she was like nothing most people had ever seen -- three gold 
medals and one world record in events long dominated by women with thick 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
She tore through the Olympic pool with a slapping stroke that, above water, 
looked like the last desperate plea of a drowning victim. 
</P>
<P>
Experts told us what happens above the water doesn't matter, it's what happens 
below, and below the water, they said, Janet Evans was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Three gold medals made that easy to figure. But what seemed to endear Evans to 
the American public was what happened above the water: the block-long smile, 
the giggles, the absolute absence of pretense. 
</P>
<P>
She became insta-star, America's kid sister. Swimmer Matt Biondi won more gold 
medals (5), sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner was more awesome to watch, Carl 
Lewis and Greg Louganis might have proven themselves the nation's greatest 
Olympians, but no American came back from Seoul more adored than Janet Evans. 
</P>
<P>
She walked off a plane and in front of a television camera. Make that cameras. 
Returning to Placentia, the Evans' family car passed under banners thanking 
Janet, lawns drafting her ("Janet For Mayor," the placards read) and home to a 
block party attended by 500 close friends, well-wishers, strangers, gawkers and 
minicams. 
</P>
<P>
Her first day back at school was no less hectic: battalions of reporters and 
photographers descending upon El Dorado High. 
</P>
<P>
She appeared with rich man, Johnny Carson of The Tonight Show, and Poorman, on 
KROQ radio with deejay The Poorman, and received an invitation to the White 
House from The Man. 
</P>
<P>
She rode in the Disneyland Parade, the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and was grand 
marshal of the Placentia Heritage Days Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Naively, she observed, "I've never come from a meet and had anything like this 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back with several months of perspective, she revised, "I guess I should 
have realized that it was the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
She said that sitting in a hotel room in Phoenix, the day before she was to be 
grand marshal of the Fiesta Day Parade. She has been the toast at banquets, 
luncheons and award presentations. But she has refused to sign any endorsement 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
Though the media demand for her is much less frenzied, "it's died down a lot," 
it is still constant -- there are a couple national magazine covers planned for 
her for early 1989. There are more than a few companies that would love to have 
her on their side of the debit column. But no. One call to Biondi, who did sign 
the endorsement deals, persuaded her. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he didn't have a home, that he just lived from hotel room to hotel 
room, 'just going where they tell me to,' " Evans said. "We talked to them 
(companies) and they said I could make a lot of money but it would be a 
full-time job, that I would be so busy that I wouldn't be able to finish high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"I know if I did it, I could be set for life, but finishing high school is very 
important to me, so I said no." 
</P>
<P>
And then she probably smiled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THREE IN A FISHBOWL 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang stepped into 1988 already having the distinction of being the 
youngest male tennis player to win the U.S. Tennis Assn. national 18-and-under 
singles title and the youngest to win a singles match at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, at 16, he became the youngest to win a singles match at Wimbledon. He 
advanced to the U.S. Open's fourth round this year before being eliminated by 
the 18-year-old Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
With the best tennis players in the world now residing in West Germany and 
Sweden, Chang and Agassi's coming of age signaled hope for American men's 
tennis, which has been mired in post-Jimbo/Big Mac depression. 
</P>
<P>
Like Agassi, Chang hits the ball with amazing velocity and moves his body just 
about as fast. Pancho Segura compared him to a young Ken Rosewall. 
</P>
<P>
France's Henry LeConte succinctly summed up Chang's past, present and future 
when he said, "He moves so quickly with such good timing. I'm thinking, 
'Sixteen years old?' God." 
</P>
<P>
Michele Granger did everything in 1988 to confirm that she is the best softball 
pitcher in the world. She ended her high school career at Valencia holding 
national records for single-season strikeouts, career strikeouts, career 
no-hitters and tied the mark for single-season no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
But while she has won numerous national and international titles -- including a 
gold medal during the 1987 Pan American Games -- she failed to win a Southern 
Section championship in her 4 years at Valencia High. Her high school career 
came to a bizarre end during a 25-inning, 3-A semifinal game against La Mirada 
that took 2 days to play. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia had 10 hits in the game but failed to score. The Tigers also made 9 
errors, 3 of which led to La Mirada's 1 run and the victory. Granger struck out 
40 in the game and afterward, in, perhaps, 1988's greatest overstatement said, 
"I let my team down." 
</P>
<P>
Derek Brown came into 1988 having performed well in 2 varsity seasons as the 
starting tailback for arguably Orange County's highest-profile football program 
-- Servite High in Anaheim. But he played in the long shadow cast by Crespi 
High's Russell White, who came into this year a two-time winner of the 
large-school division's most valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
White began the season with the publicity, but Brown eventually made the season 
his own. In a memorable October meeting between the two backs, Brown outgained 
White 312 yards to 81 as Servite won the game 35-20. 
</P>
<P>
Brown went on to lead the Southern Section in rushing and set an Orange County 
single-season rushing record with 2,301 yards. He and Fountain Valley 
quarterback David Henigan were named co-Division 1 most valuable players. 
</P>
<P>
When it was clear that Brown was having a better season than White, the Crespi 
back quipped, "He better remember who was the originator and who is the 
imitator." 
</P>
<P>
By year's end, Derek Brown and the rest of Orange County's kid wonders made 
certain they'd be remembered for quite a while.

STOCK WATCH: SOME COMPANIES HIT HARDEST BY CRASH PICKED UP THE PIECES, CAME OUT 
AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SCHINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Friday, the last trading day of 1988, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
briefly climbed above the level it had enjoyed before the October, 1987, market 
collapse. It was a fitting end to a year that proved stronger than expected, 
with the Dow increasing 12%. 
</P>
<P>
It was equally fitting that the best performing Orange County stocks of 1988 
were among those hardest hit by the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's star performers managed to rescue themselves from the rubble to 
either approach or surpass their pre-crash highs. In most cases, analysts said, 
they are solid companies that enjoyed healthy returns. 
</P>
<P>
ICN Biomedicals, a Costa Mesa medical instruments and chemicals company, led 
the pack on a percentage basis. The stock rose 331%, starting the year at $3.25 
and finishing at $14. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 9 months of its current fiscal year, ICN Biomedicals has enjoyed 
a 35% increase in earnings. Its third-quarter performance was even stronger, 
with profits up 59%. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco Corp., an Irvine manufacturer of office copier and printer products, 
placed second, appreciating 126% for the year. Gradco stock, which began the 
year at $5.875, closed at $13.25. 
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year ended March, 1988, Gradco reported net income of $4.1 
million on sales of $90.9 million, and the company continued to post strong 
numbers over the latter part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 12 months, most investors steered clear of small companies. 
Many had been burned badly by the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the smaller Orange County companies are not very liquid, and they 
just got hammered in the crash, as people fell over themselves to get out of 
them," said Larry Selwitz, director of research at Cruttenden &amp; Co., a 
Newport Beach brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors who got back into the market in 1988 initially chose to buy 
stocks in larger, more established companies. 
</P>
<P>
But as the year wore on and many Orange County companies began to report strong 
earnings, investors started funneling money into such companies as ICN 
Biomedicals, Ropak and Gradco. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock of some of these companies had become so oversold that people 
realized these prices offered unusually good value," Selwitz said. "It was an 
opportunity for people to make a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the county's biggest market losers generally reflected unspectacular 
corporate performance. 
</P>
<P>
Resdel Industries, a Newport Beach electronics firm, lost the most ground in 
1988. Its stock began the year at $5.25 a share and crashed to $1.4375, a 73% 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
The company posted an $8.3-million loss for the year ended June 30 and 
disclosed in October that it had laid off 130 people, or more than a third of 
its work force. The firm's problems were attributed primarily to unsuccessful 
efforts to expand through acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Another bomb was Diceon Electronics, which began the year trading at $30.50 but 
declined to $12.50 at year end, losing 59% of its value. 
</P>
<P>
Diceon had sales of $147 million and earned $9.8 million in the fiscal year 
ended in September. But most of its profits were realized in the first 6 months 
of the year, while the second half was a dud. Analysts are projecting that the 
company will have flat earnings for the first half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Diceon, which for several years has been one of Orange County's 
top performing growth companies, was snubbed by analysts and investors. 
</P>
<P>
Preston Athey, a growth fund manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, said he 
continues to hold Diceon and several other Orange County stocks because of what 
he believes are bright prospects for small growth companies in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
T. Rowe Price has about $1.3 billion invested in emerging growth funds. The 
investment firm's Orange County holdings include National Education of Irvine, 
Silicon Systems of Tustin and Archive Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Athey said a statistical indicator used by T. Rowe Price recently signaled that 
many, small growth companies "are grossly undervalued" relative to historic 
norms. 
</P>
<P>
"If the past is any indication, 1989 is the year that these stocks will do very 
well relative to the rest of the market," Athey said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is particularly bullish about small growth companies because many 
economists and analysts are projecting that their earnings growth will outpace 
larger companies in 1989.

COUNTY'S PLAN IS GARBAGE; 
</P>
<P>
TRASH DISPOSAL: IF SOMETHING ISN'T DONE QUICKLY, LOS ANGELES CITY RESIDENTS 
WILL END UP MAKING UNJUSTIFIED CONCESSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO COSBY-ROSSMANN, Antonio Cosby-Rossmann, an attorney and lecturer at 
Stanford Law School, has represented citizens of the City of Los Angeles in the 
garbage wars since 1973. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County of Los Angeles, which has historically embraced some of the nation's 
sharpest land swindles, is out to break new ground in its legacy of shady 
real-estate deals. 
</P>
<P>
Purportedly acting to provide a badly needed garbage facility, the Board of 
Supervisors has secretly approved a plan that will enrich the county 
bureaucracy and a high-powered developer at the expense of Los Angeles city 
taxpayers and Santa Monica Mountains park users. Because the City Council 
tentatively approved the plan with little public notice or review, aggressive 
citizen action is needed to keep it from becoming reality. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' plan begins with a worthy enough goal: to construct a readily 
accessible, environmentally sound garbage-disposal facility that can meet 
countywide needs for half a century. The location, Elsmere Canyon, lies in the 
San Gabriel Mountains just north of the city-county line and along the Antelope 
Valley Freeway. Virtually all the experts agree that Elsmere is the appropriate 
place for the county's major disposal facility. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than seize with principle this opportunity to meet public needs, the 
supervisors' program threatens establishment of the dump by attaching illegal 
and unwise conditions to Elsmere's use by all county residents. Like an 
entrepreneur in control of a hot property, the county sees Elsmere as an 
opportunity to maximize profits, broaden its options for future trash disposal 
and realize revenge against an old adversary, the city. Taking advantage of its 
public power to condemn the Elsmere land, the county seeks to extort 
unjustified concessions from city residents. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the supervisors demand as a condition of dumping Los Angeles 
city garbage in Elsmere Canyon: 
</P>
<P>
 -- That dumping in Lopez Canyon be expanded and continued until 1996, even 
though the site violates state standards; 
</P>
<P>
 -- That dumping in Sunshine Canyon also be expanded, even though the operation 
violates a 25-year-old city permit; 
</P>
<P>
 -- That the city pay an extra "tribute" of at least $1 dollar a ton for 
dumping at Elsmere that can be increased at the sole discretion of the county 
and its Sanitation District; 
</P>
<P>
 -- That Rustic and Sullivan canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains be sold at 
market value, rather than released to park agencies at acquisition costs, as 
state law requires. (The sites are no longer suitable for dumping but held in 
trust by the county Sanitation District for public recreation.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- That Mission Canyon, county-owned under the same trusteeship as Rustic and 
Sullivan canyons, not be released for recreational use but be sold to developer 
Ray Watt, providing necessary access to his ambitious and adjacent development. 
</P>
<P>
Extortion of the city is the only glue holding together the Elsmere plan. 
County supervisors have been angry ever since the city closed the county's 
Mission Canyon garbage site in 1981. The city used its land-use authority to 
end dumping at the facility, located within city limits, citing harm done to 
surrounding neighbors. In response, the county has prohibited the city from 
dumping garbage at county sites open to other municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
This policy of blackmail, designed to force the city to place new garbage dumps 
within its borders, regardless of the environmental consequences, did not work 
so long as existing city facilities had not reached capacity. But with Lopez 
and Sunshine canyons nearing their limits, the extortion becomes more 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative solutions exist that would create a garbage facility for all county 
residents, expand recreational opportunities in the Santa Monica Mountains and 
end existing conflicts over garbage dumping next to established neighborhoods: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Elsmere facility, designed to prevent harm to existing neighbors, 
should be established as soon as possible; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elsmere should be open at uniform fees to all residents; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 -- Garbage dumping in Lopez and Sunshine canyons should terminate when current 
permits expire; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rustic, Sullivan and Mission canyons should be transferred to the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy for recreation at acquisition cost; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elsmere's uniform disposal fees should be used to reimburse the county and 
its Sanitation District for the transfer of the canyons, because all county 
residents will benefit from this new parkland; 
</P>
<P>
 -- The state attorney general should immediately prosecute county officials 
who maintain the policy of extortion. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the county's secretly formulated plan has been exposed, citizens and 
their representatives at City Hall can force a publicly acceptable substitute. 
As shown by its vote last month to require separation of household trash, the 
City Council can make sound policy. Los Angeles citizens and their council must 
undo the county's attempted swindle of public resources.

ROMANIAN REBUILDING

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deaths of thousands of people in Timisoara and Bucharest were not in vain. 
The extent of the tyranny that ruled Romania is beyond belief. 
</P>
<P>
For such a monstrosity to be overcome so fast is in itself a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
The battle is hardly over; although the cancerous core of the leadership is 
gone, the weight of the past must be now reshaped into a future. This could be 
the first time in recent history that America and the Soviet Union cooperate in 
the rebuilding of a shattered state and economy. 
</P>
<P>
Romania needs all the help we can offer: Advisers from a mutual pool of 
human/technological resources provided through the United Nations and other 
international bodies. An unprecedented opportunity is now presenting itself; a 
global shift towards increased cooperation between the East and West on many 
levels previously thought impossible. 
</P>
<P>
The bloody failure of the police state run by Ceausescu could have become a 
drawn-out civil war. Instead, it seems to be headed in a positive direction. 
</P>
<P>
We can help Romania and Eastern Europe rebuild their economies, and work 
together towards a positive future. There are astounding implications for world 
peace and commerce, two faces of the same dream.

LEGALIZING ILLICIT DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three cheers for Rep. George W. Crockett (D-Mich.), columnist William F. 
Buckley, former Secretary of State George Schultz, U.S. District Judge Robert 
Sweet and Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. While countless other public officials 
exploit the drug problem for personal political advantage, they have 
unselfishly championed the only rational, effective alternative to the 
currently disastrous situation: legalization. 
</P>
<P>
Supply does not create demand. Demand creates supply. We can spend any amount 
of money trying to intercept substances. We can impose any penalty on the 
dealers and users. We can completely erode the civil rights of our citizens. 
But as long as someone is willing to pay for a commodity, someone will be 
willing to supply that commodity; and the more risk the suppliers assume, the 
greater their profits will be. This is basic economics, simple human nature and 
can not be altered by legislation. 
</P>
<P>
What we can do is eliminate international drug lords, terrorism, corruption and 
criminal empires by taking the profit out of the equation. By shattering their 
market, we can literally shut down these drug mafias overnight. 
</P>
<P>
We can also redirect our efforts and resources toward diminishing the demand 
for drugs by accurately publicizing the health risks inherent to the user. 
Former Surgeon General Koop has demonstrated that the public can be positively 
influenced in terms of substance abuse. And he didn't require a $9 billion 
budget to do it. 
</P>
<P>
By initiating serious discussion of the decriminalization issue, Messrs. 
Crockett, Buckley, Schultz, Sweet and Schmoke have done far more to protect our 
youth from the drug problem than all the rest of the "drug warriors" combined.

Surprise. Domestic auto sales are in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
I submit a partial list of possible reasons why: 
</P>
<P>
My 1985 Dodge Shelby Charger has had the brakes fail, the alternator fail, the 
timing belt fail, the computer fail, the headlights fail, the fuel system fail, 
the radio fail, the tachometer fail, the cooling system fail, the 
air-conditioning system fail, the battery fail (twice), the hatch lifters fail 
and the paint fail. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the turbo, lurking under the hood for the warranty to expire amid 
a flurry of repair dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any question why the American public is giving pause before purchasing 
a domestic automobile that is (1) overpriced to start with, (2) unreliable and 
will need inevitable/expensive repair of even basic systems and (3) will lose 
resale value faster than back issues of Proctology Digest?

LEGALIZING ILLICIT DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Kunstler (Op-Ed, Dec. 15, "Why Not Sell at the Local Pharmacy?") 
continues the cry for drug legalization. Typically he raises the specter of 
violence, illicit profits, etc. and reaches the perfectly logical conclusion 
that prohibition doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, no thinking person would disagree with him. He fails, however, to 
point out that legalization (of alcohol, caffeine and nicotine) is hardly a 
howling success. 
</P>
<P>
Since our society has been so unsuccessful in "educating and treating" the 
current crop of boozers, smokers and coffee drinkers, what in the world makes 
Kunstler and all the rest think that, once legalized, the control of the much 
more addictive and psychoactive substances such as cocaine, marijuana and 
heroin will be so simple?

POP GOES THE REFUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pennies will be closer to nickels today for thrifty consumers who recycle their 
empty soda and beer containers. A new state law will boost the ineffective 
one-cent refund to a nickel for two small cans or one large bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The higher refunds will make recycling a little more rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
Californians have bothered to return barely half of their empties to recycling 
depots at nearby supermarkets or to a state-certified recycling centers since 
the bottle law took effect just over two years ago. Even environmentally minded 
consumers have argued that a penny back wasn't worth the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The stronger incentive takes effect today. An empty two-liter bottle, glass or 
plastic, is worth five cents. Also, worth a nickel are two cans or bottles that 
contain less than 24 ounces. Five cents, the standard reward in states that 
have successful bottle laws, ought to prove persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
Californians drink 12 billion bottles and cans of soda or beer in a typical 
year. The empties choke landfills -- and that's when the cans and bottles are 
properly disposed. Many are just tossed away by litterbugs, blighting beaches, 
parks and roads. Maybe a nickel will change their bad habits. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling can take some pressure off the distressed environment. Consumers who 
take the time to return their empties deserve their reward.

TRIBUTE TO A WAR HERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not too long ago many Americans believed marijuana was no more harmful than 
tobacco, and a presidential adviser described cocaine as "probably the most 
benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread use . . ." Back then, police 
officers fought a dangerous, lonely and unappreciated war against drugs. Los 
Angeles Police Officer Kelly Key was one of its troopers. 
</P>
<P>
He was paralyzed nearly two decades ago by a bullet fired while he tried to 
serve a search warrant on a suspected cocaine dealer. Key died last week, 
having spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair from which he taught 
youngsters the dangers of drugs and other temptations of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
A quadriplegic, he still volunteered three days a week at the Gwen Bolden 
Foundation, an after-school counseling program in a rough neighborhood south of 
downtown Los Angeles. Key was a tutor and a mentor, often for boys with no 
other man in their lives. He bought book-packs, shoes and treated youngsters to 
lunch, which was for many their first experience in a restaurant. He quietly 
did things to teach youngsters to feel good about themselves. There was no 
better role model in the war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Drug use has exploded exponentially since a bullet cut short Key's once-bright 
police career in 1970. Now it destroys lives, families and communities 
wholesale. As the terror of the nightmare grows, more officers like Key risk 
their lives. But, as law enforcement leaders are beginning to recognize, the 
war must be waged with equal fervor against the underlying social causes that 
make illicit drugs so alluring for so many. Prevention must be as important as 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Key, who turned 49 the day before he died, will be buried Tuesday with 
full Police Department honors. His tombstone should read: Pioneer and Hero in 
the War Against Drugs.

DEAR DR. BROTHERS: How can I help build my children's self-esteem and make them 
able to succeed in a tough world? I don't want them to be insensitive, but I 
don't want them to wilt every time something difficult comes along. My wife and 
I aren't wealthy, so they're going to have to make it on their own. -- T.S. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR T.S.: The fact that you're aware that youngsters need to be able to cope 
with frustration and disappointment is already a plus. Children need to learn 
how to cope with defeat and parents need to explain that we all learn from our 
failures. If a child doesn't know this, he may limit himself by trying only 
those tasks he knows he can do well. 
</P>
<P>
When things go wrong, when your youngster gets a disappointing grade or when he 
fails on a test, help him not to be overcome by these setbacks. Remind him that 
they are temporary and that he can learn from his past errors and do better 
next time. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Scheier, a psychologist at Carnegie-Mellon University, found that 
optimists handle stress better than pessimists. Optimists tend to respond to 
disappointments by formulating a plan of action and asking other people for 
help and advice while pessimists are likely to react to the same difficulties 
by trying to forget the whole thing or by assuming there's nothing they can do 
to change things. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I'm engaged to a wonderful woman but I'm troubled by what 
happens to her when she drinks. First of all, she doesn't seem to know when to 
stop, and when I mention this the next day, she gets defensive, assuring me 
that she can stop whenever she wants. I know that after we've been celebrating 
at a party, she doesn't remember things that have happened the night before. 
This is important because she frequently behaves badly. How can I handle this 
and should I insist that she go on the wagon? -- F.T. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR F.T.: I doubt that you'd accomplish much if you simply "insisted" that she 
go on the wagon. She's showing symptoms of alcoholism, such as personality 
changes when she drinks, denial about her drinking patterns and blackouts or 
memory lapses. While some non-alcoholics do occasionally experience these same 
symptoms, it's unusual and is a strong indication that there are serious 
drinking problems. 
</P>
<P>
There are ways to spot future alcoholics, such as the need to find constant 
excuses for a drink, and the pattern of having every occasion -- sad or happy 
-- begin and end with a drink. Another clue that you seem to be getting is the 
inability of your friend to stop drinking or to refuse alcohol once she's 
started. 
</P>
<P>
Try to get her to some meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. If she refuses, I'd 
postpone plans for marriage until she reconsiders.

GRIM TALES INHABIT SPECIAL DARK REALITY

A Place of Light by Mary Bush (Morrow: $16.95; 258 pps.) 
</P>
<P>
"I had four sisters in my life, but Maude is the only one alive," a boy in his 
teens tells us in one of these stories. That's because his mother has the nasty 
habit of killing off her babies when they cry too much. All of the short 
stories in this sober, brilliant collection are set in rural, poverty-stricken, 
Upstate New York -- deserted backwaters where there are no jobs. The land is 
played out; the smart, enterprising people have left, and the collective gene 
pool is something you wouldn't want to dive into. 
</P>
<P>
What are "we" -- and, by that pronoun, I mean the educated, the orderly, even 
the "enlightened" readers scanning this review right now -- to make of stories 
like these? 
</P>
<P>
My feeling is that having lived through the so-called "holiday" season, many of 
us have had to notice once again that human emotions are often irrational and 
base; that maybe 50% of all parents wish devoutly that they'd never had their 
children; maybe 75% of all children -- even in these "enlightened" times -- 
grow up in terror of their parents, and, if they live long enough, are able to 
turn the tables on those creatures who have been so penurious with their 
affection and so prodigal with their insults and their dreadful threats, their 
pledges of undying hatred. The child has no recourse but to live long enough, 
stick around and make his or her abusive parents miserable and afraid! 
Something to live for, in these trying times. 
</P>
<P>
This collection deals with several levels of terror that (perhaps all) children 
have to deal with at one level or another. "Underground Railroad," with its 
baby-slaughtering mother, is only the most extreme example here. Some of these 
tales seem comparatively innocuous: "Muskrat" and "Rude Awakening" are both 
gender-oriented, coming-of-age stories: In the former, two small boys set out 
to trap muskrat and end up with something large and alive that isn't a muskrat, 
already suffering terribly from the cramped iron trap on its leg. Too fearful 
to let it loose, too fearful to admit their fear, the boys finally suffocate 
the animal by burying it alive in stones. 
</P>
<P>
Harmless, maybe, "Boys will be boys," and all that, but this stolid 
indifference to suffering comes back to haunt the reader in another story as 
two adult hunters carelessly terrorize a young couple in the woods. In "Rude 
Awakening" a young girl, cordially detested by her mother, is forced to put 
aside her overalls and don a white veil for her First Communion. She gets sick, 
and after long and horrible minutes, finally spits out the Host. Again, no harm 
is done, all little girls get sick, but her alienation from her family, her 
sense of being totally alone in the world, is confirmed forever. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these stories emerge from poverty, so that, if we own a microwave and 
an automatic coffee pot, or are saving our money in CDs, we may be able to 
persuade ourselves that they are not our stories. In "Difficult Passage," a 
little girl wheels her legless grandpa to the circus to see freaks, realizing 
in the process that the poverty-stricken people in her own town are not just 
the audience, but freaks as well. 
</P>
<P>
In two separate stories, incest (or plain child molestation), may be blamed on 
unemployment: If Uncle JoJo in "Outlaws" or the repellent Robert in "A Place of 
Light" had decent jobs, perhaps they wouldn't spend their waking hours trying 
to have sex with small girls. But I don't believe money fixes everything, and 
neither does the author. In two stories, unexpectedly, sanctuaries appear, out 
in grim woods, where, people manage to live in harmony with their surroundings 
and with self-respect. Just seeing these places, these people, heartens other 
characters, trapped in their own misery. Maybe it is possible to live another 
way, in a decent way. 
</P>
<P>
Always, with stories like this, there is that lame editorial attempt at 
distancing. In a downright pitiful blurb of this book, someone writes, ". . . 
Harsh lives make for compelling drama." Maybe. But I have a feeling the world 
is made up of those who know these stories are reality, and others, who peek 
into these pages, play dumb and say "Yum yum! Look at all these harsh lives and 
all this compelling drama!" 
</P>
<P>
Those who know this grim reality will take these stories straight to their sad 
hearts: "Not one other family looked like theirs," one lost little girl thinks. 
"No one was making a scene. No one else was miserable." But a lot of other 
people -- even with Dad hauling in the bucks and Mom wearing a giant gold 
necklace -- are starving, right now, for love. Or, dry as a bone, they know 
themselves unable to give that love. That's not "compelling drama." That's 
reality. Mary Bush reminds all of us that, paradoxically, in our terrible 
isolation, we're not alone.

<P>
THE ECCENTRIC BUDDHIST VISION OF ITO JAKUCHU, GREENGROCER AND ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An exhibition of Japanese paintings that caused a stir last fall in New York 
recently arrived at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. "The Paintings of 
Jakuchu," which features an astonishing range of works by one of 18th-Century 
Japan's authentically great individualists, is certain to captivate aficionados 
as well as visitors who just wander into the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Jakuchu's colorfully painted scrolls depicting flora and fauna are so profusely 
detailed and brilliantly designed that they defy imagining how any mere human 
being could have created them. At the opposite extreme is his breathtakingly 
minimal series of six ink-on-paper scrolls called "Lotus Pond." The quiet scene 
melts away into a central space that appears to be empty but is actually filled 
with the specter of death and winter. 
</P>
<P>
Between these two poles of Jakuchu's sensibility are relatively crude paintings 
of clay dolls, striking woodblock prints of bright birds on velvety black 
backgrounds and -- seriously -- a funeral scene portraying the dead Buddha as a 
radish surrounded by mourning vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
There's a certain logic to "Vegetable Parinirvana," the improbable and 
apparently irreverent death scene. Ito Jakuchu (1716-1800) was the son of a 
greengrocer and ran the family's wholesale business for 17 years before he 
became a full-time artist at 40. He may have been more at home with the 
mushrooms, persimmons, yams and cucumbers in his parody than with human 
characters. An assiduous observer of nature, Jakuchu also raised chickens and 
elevated them to lofty heights of grace and beauty in his paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Environment may account for some of his subject matter, but there's no 
explaining the innovative talent and brilliant eccentricity that has 
distinguished Jakuchu in the annals of Japanese painting. A born artist, he was 
ill-suited to business and eventually unloaded that burden on a younger 
brother. Jakuchu had classical training in Japanese painting and drew 
inspiration from Chinese painters, but he developed such an unusual style that 
he stands out as an eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
One wonders how he got away with it, but in fact he was highly regarded during 
his life. Jakuchu had the good fortune to live in Kyoto during a peaceful time 
when a spirit of experimentation and individuality was in vogue. 
</P>
<P>
He initially gained fame for his masterpiece -- a series of 30 vividly painted 
scrolls known as the "Colorful Realm of Living Beings." Painted from about 1757 
to 1765, the scrolls are a pictorial encyclopedia of plants and animals 
interpreted according to Jakuchu's vision of peace and prosperity. He presented 
the scrolls in 1765 to Shokukuji, a Zen temple in Kyoto. They are part of the 
Imperial Household Collection and are rarely put on public exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Examples currently on display in Los Angeles are panels called "Mandarin Ducks 
in Snow," "Hydrangeas and Fowl," "Fish in a Lotus Pond," "Golden Pheasants in 
Snow" and "Birds and Peonies." All are poetic marriages of flora and fauna, so 
closely entwined that they seem to be of a piece. Striking in composition -- 
characterized by sweeping curves and rhythmic repetition -- the scrolls are 
skillfully detailed down to the last detail of the last feather. 
</P>
<P>
These color paintings represent one major component of Jakuchu's work. The 
other is ink paintings that reveal the artist's devotion to Zen. Strictly 
speaking, however, the ink paintings do not conform to Zen principles. Despite 
their enormous energy and directness, they are more calculated, less 
spontaneous in feeling than classical Zen works. 
</P>
<P>
Jakuchu was a lay Zen priest, so his affinity to the philosophy's artistic 
precepts are expected. But he was also such an individualist that he inevitably 
came up with his own style. It is typified by such ink paintings as "Two 
Roosters and a Hen" and "Pine, Plum and Crane," which contrast dramatic shapes 
and patterns with open space. 
</P>
<P>
About 45 works, on loan from Japanese collections, are on view on the lower 
floor of the Ahmanson Building, but they are only the beginning of a 
three-course Jakuchu banquet. Because of Japanese government regulations and 
the fragility of the works, "The Paintings of Jakuchu" is being presented in 
two parts. Part I continues through Jan. 14. Part II will be shown from Jan. 18 
to Feb. 18. Each portion contains a full chronological range of the artist's 
work, so that visitors who only see one part can grasp the whole of his oeuvre. 
</P>
<P>
The third course of the banquet is an auxiliary exhibition (to Feb. 18) in the 
Japanese Pavilion. "The Colorful Realm of Jakuchu and Jakuen" consists of works 
by the master and his most prominent student, Jakuen, from American 
collections. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Denver Art Museum 
and four private collectors have loaned pieces that complement the County 
Museum of Art's extensive Jakuchu collection.

Talk Show Host Gets Death Threat: A radio talk show host in Greenville, S.C., 
said he has received a death threat invoking the name of a Denver radio 
personality whose murder was linked to white supremacists. Mike Gallagher, 
whose talk show on WFBC-AM airs from 9 a.m. until noon, said he had just 
finished a program on racism on Thursday when he received a telephone call from 
a man who identified himself only as "George from Anderson," a South Carolina 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher said the caller told him to "remember Alan Berg," the Denver talk 
show host who was gunned down in 1984. When Gallagher left the station around 2 
p.m., he found a note on his car windshield that included a racial remark, 
another reference to Berg and the words, "You're a dead man." The threat, which 
is being investigated by police, came after Gallagher and his callers discussed 
the controversy over a South Carolina sheriff accused of using a racial slur.

The Bride Wore Black: Jeff Clayton, 26-year-old lead singer with the punk rock 
band Anti-Seen, exchanged wedding vows Saturday with 20-year-old Dee Dazis in a 
Charlotte, N.C., nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
The bride wore black, as did almost all the guests. The best man was a woman 
and the flower girl was a grown man. Clayton and his bride promised "to love 
and obey, to have and to hold, to rock 'n' roll until death do us part." As 
soon as the vows were pronounced, Clayton left his bride at the bar and 
performed songs from Anti-Seen's latest album, "Noise for the Sake of Noise." 
Observed one guest: "Rock 'n' roll is, like, forever." SHAUNA SNOW

PAYCHECKS TO MEDICARE -- NEW FEDERAL LAWS TAKE EFFECT 
</P>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new year ushers in an array of federal laws and regulations affecting 
everything from the size of Americans' paychecks to the operation of the Panama 
Canal. 
</P>
<P>
During the first week of 1990, Social Security taxes and benefits will go up, 
Medicare coverage will be cut back because of the repeal of catastrophic 
illness insurance and the canal will get a Panamanian administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term programs will be started Jan. 1 to control Medicare payments to 
doctors, close military bases, prevent an accidental clash between U.S. and 
Soviet forces and set up new task forces to fight organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
The new laws and regulations include: 
</P>
<P>
Social Security -- Automatic 4.7% cost-of-living increases start for 39 million 
Social Security and Supplemental Security Income recipients. Average monthly 
benefits rise from $541 to $566 for Social Security and from $368 to $386 under 
SSI. 
</P>
<P>
The total Social Security tax rate rises from 7.51% to 7.65% and the maximum 
earnings subject to the tax will be go up from $48,000 to $51,300. The maximum 
tax bite will rise from $3,604.80 to $3,924.45. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of money Social Security recipients can earn without a reduction in 
benefits increases from $8,880 to $9,360 for those between ages 65 and 69 and 
from $6,480 to $6,840 for those under 65. 
</P>
<P>
Panama Canal -- Under the 1979 Panama Canal Act, the U.S. administrator, Dennis 
McAuliffe, steps down and turns over day-to-day control of the waterway to a 
Panamanian, who reports to the U.S.-dominated canal commission. 
</P>
<P>
Until the administrator nominated by the new government of Panama is approved 
by President Bush and the Senate, the deputy administrator, Fernando Manfredo, 
a Panamanian, will be acting administrator. Panama takes over the Canal on Dec. 
31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare -- Because of the repeal of the Catastrophic Coverage Act, 32.6 
million senior citizens lose some hospitalization, skilled nursing and hospice 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
In one major change, seniors face paying a hospital deductible for each 90-day 
benefit period and daily $148 co-payments after the 60th day. Under the old 
law, the elderly received 365 days of hospitalization for one deductible. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a computer glitch, the monthly supplemental catastrophic coverage 
premium will be deducted from Social Security checks and then refunded for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital deductible automatically increases from $560 to $592 to cover 
rising costs. The monthly Part B premium, covering doctor fees, rises from 
$27.90 to $28.60. But because seniors no longer owe a supplemental premium, 
Part B costs actually will be lower. 
</P>
<P>
The program to control the growth in Medicare payments to doctors and to shift 
spending from specialized procedures begins. In 1990, a 9.1% rise in costs has 
been targeted, contrasted with recent increases of 16%. 
</P>
<P>
National Security -- The military begins a program to close 86 bases by 1995. 
The cost-saving plan was drafted by a commission created by Congress and took 
effect when congressional opponents failed to muster enough votes to kill it in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Communications between the United States and the Soviet Union will be improved 
to prevent accidental conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes -- Farm workers subject to Social Security withholding will be subject to 
income tax withholding. 
</P>
<P>
The excise tax paid by passengers on international flights from the United 
States increases from $3 to $6. 
</P>
<P>
A new excise tax of $3 will be charged each passenger on some ocean voyages. 
</P>
<P>
An excise tax of 5 cents a barrel will be levied on crude oil and imported 
petroleum products to create a trust fund to clean up oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
An excise tax on ozone-depleting chemicals will take effect. 
</P>
<P>
Tax preparers who fail to sign a return or fail to include a taxpayer 
identification number will face new penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Loan Programs -- The Veterans Affairs Department will guarantee up to $46,000 
of a home loan for a veteran or a survivor, up from $36,000. 
</P>
<P>
Schools whose students have fault rate of 30% or more will be excluded from the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous -- Organized crime task forces will be set up in each of the 23 
U.S. attorney's offices, replacing autonomous task forces.

BEHIND PASADENA'S ROSE-COLORED GLASSES, A CITY OF DIVERSITY; 
</P>
<P>
PARADE: COLORFUL FLOATS AND SPIRITED BANDS WILL TAKE A TOUR OF THE CITY'S HIGH

<P>
There is a popular theory that views the Tournament of Roses as a prime reason 
-- the prime reason -- for the population explosion in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Every year on New Year's Day, millions of shivering Easterners and 
Midwesterners tune their television sets to the festivities in Pasadena. What 
they see is a compelling small-screen vision of balmy revelry, complete with 
suntanned princesses, football players in short sleeves, swirls of flowers and 
sun-dappled mountains. Then, migrating like lemmings, dazzled television 
viewers join the westward march. 
</P>
<P>
So goes the theory. 
</P>
<P>
For a century, Pasadenans have treasured that vision of their city as a place 
where dreams come true and the weather's fine any time of year. 
</P>
<P>
But behind the image of civilized hoopla is a complicated city of 132,000, 
struggling fitfully to reconcile its diverse elements. These days, the 
once-idyllic community -- which seems to stretch across the map of the western 
San Gabriel Valley like a child's bib -- has gangs, drugs, smog and a running 
debate on development. But it also can boast of visionary entrepreneurship, 
socially concerned city leaders, impressive arts and educational institutions 
and -- especially during the holiday season -- a spirit of optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"The Tournament focuses international attention on the city," said Pasadena 
Mayor William Thomson, "but it's also a time of celebration within the city. We 
tend to put aside our troubles and differences and focus on the good things in 
our lives." 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Parade, which began 101 years ago as a horse-and-buggy romp through 
wrestern Pasadena, now cuts through the geographical and economic heart of the 
city. For discerning Pasadenans, the 5.5-mile parade route represents a brief 
tour of the city's high points and low points. 
</P>
<P>
It begins, fittingly, on Orange Grove Boulevard, where the city itself began in 
the late 19th Century. The parade starts out from the heart of well-to-do 
Pasadena, in a palmy section south of the Rose Bowl called "Millionaire's Row." 
</P>
<P>
By 8:10 a.m. today, when the Riverside Community College Marching Tigers Band 
leads the parade down the boulevard, the neighborhood will be crammed with 
floats and marchers. 
</P>
<P>
For well-heeled residents, this is something between a nuisance and a blessing. 
"You sort of can't live with it and you can't live without it," said Ken 
Grobecker, who grumbles good-naturedly about the parade goers who jam the west 
Pasadena neighborhood each year. 
</P>
<P>
The parade moves out slowly, passing the sprawling Norton Simon Museum of Art, 
then moving into Old Pasadena, the city's commercial district. 
</P>
<P>
Old Pasadena is where city planners like to tout their city's spirit of 
creativity. In less than 10 years, the area has gone from Skid Row to "Westwood 
East." Buildings that once moldered in disuse now house a Cajun restaurant, a 
fitness club, an espresso bar and a disco. More than 120 new businesses have 
opened there since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Brignole was one of the pioneers. He bought an 80-year-old DeLacey Avenue 
stable in 1985 and turned it into a prosperous health club. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is overjoyed about the crowds of young urban professionals surging 
from shop to shop. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a shiny new coat of paint, but, yeah, it's lost something," said Paul 
Elliott, a former Art Center College of Design student. 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite place was a bar called Hazel's," he said, "where the old-timers 
used to sit at the bar and drink straight shots of whiskey. . . . Now I see 
they've built a Benetton's where the Salvation Army used to be. That's the end 
of any neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
His is a minority view. Cassandra Einstein, a San Marino artist who sips cafe 
au lait at a Colorado Boulevard cafe, likes it just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who lives in Hollywood thinks this is the slow lane out here," said 
Einstein, a recent Los Angeles transplant. "But this is a charming little place 
to get yourself together in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
A mile or so to the north of the parade route, Carolyn Stonestreet sits on a 
bench at a Fair Oaks Avenue bus stop, talking about her troubled life in 
northwest Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically homeless now," she said. "I'm staying with my sister and her 
boyfriend. I took my kids to their grandmother." 
</P>
<P>
Stonestreet's problems began when, after a long custody fight for her children 
-- now 5 and 9 -- she was dismissed by the pharmaceutical firm where she had 
worked for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Welfare sent me to a shelter in downtown Los Angeles," she said, sobbing 
quietly. "I was terrified. I came back to Pasadena and told the social worker 
it was unbelievable. I'd rather sleep on the streets over here than go back 
over there." 
</P>
<P>
This is the neighborhood where the underclass of Pasadena lives. Predominantly 
black, northwest Pasadena had about 102 drive-by shootings in 1989. Six people 
were killed and 69 injured -- many of them innocent bystanders -- in shooting 
incidents, police say. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood also has many hard-working homeowners and apartment dwellers, 
sometimes overwhelmed by the crime around them. "The attitude by the 
authorities seems to be, as long as it's not blown out of proportion, let it 
go," one resident said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a population that's basically a labor population" but "there's not a 
single smokestack in Pasadena," said Ibrahim Naeem, director of the 
Pasadena-Foothill Branch of the Los Angeles Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a vast gap between haves and have-nots. A city commission on 
youth and families recently compared income levels in a census tract in 
northwest Pasadena with one in wealthy west Pasadena. They found a $68,170 
difference in median family income. 
</P>
<P>
Often, that gap translates into a black Pasadena and a white Pasadena, black 
leaders contend. "The city's attitude in the past can be called neglect at 
best," Naeem said. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of City Directors (Pasadena's city council) has tried recently to 
assuage the restive black community, which constitutes about 25% of the city. 
Last month, after months of criticism, the board authorized a $100,000 audit of 
city personnel practices to determine whether city policies have been racist or 
sexist over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
When the parade reaches the corner of Marengo Avenue, it is in developer 
territory, say slow-growth activists. 
</P>
<P>
The construction of the two-block Plaza Pasadena mall, between Marengo and Los 
Robles avenues, was one of the first signs that the city was on a 
no-holds-barred growth track, said Mike Salazar, co-chairman of Pasadenan 
Residents In Defense of our Environment (PRIDE). 
</P>
<P>
After 1977, when the Community Redevelopment Agency demolished such older 
structures as the Pasadena Athletic Club to make way for the mall, slow-growth 
resistance started to build. There were early battles, like a 1980 petition 
drive that ultimately stopped a plan for twin office towers in the middle of 
town. But boxy office towers continued to spring up, particularly along 
traffic-clogged Lake and Los Robles avenues. 
</P>
<P>
City planners say 156 office buildings have been built in the city since 1980, 
almost doubling office space to about 9.7 million square feet. At the same 
time, condominium projects popped up like toadstools. 
</P>
<P>
"People would go to the city and complain that it wasn't fair to their 
neighborhoods, which had been single-family homes for years," said Claire 
Bogaard, executive director of the preservation group Pasadena Heritage. "But 
generally the developers got their way." 
</P>
<P>
The scene was set for a battle at the polls. Last March, PRIDE won, as 57% of 
the voters approved a measure to restrict new housing and large commercial 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders worry that the measure will stifle the entrepreneurial spirit that 
brought Pasadena out of economic doldrums. "It's already causing a housing 
scarcity and driving up prices," Mayor Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
William Podley, president of the Pasadena-based real estate firm of Podley 
Caughey Associates, says prices are indeed skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
"Properties we handled last year for $190,000 or $195,000 are going for 
$240,000, maybe even $250,000." he said. 
</P>
<P>
The parade passes Hill Avenue, a main thoroughfare for Pasadena City College 
and, a few blocks to the south, Caltech. A mile north of the route, on 
Washington Boulevard, Mary Donikian doles out baklava for a customer at the 
American Armenian Grocery. 
</P>
<P>
It is a fragrant place, full of the dried fruits, nuts and cheeses that 
Armenians serve during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Armenians used to celebrate Christmas on Jan. 6, commemorating the arrival of 
the three kings on the Day of Epiphany. "But we're getting used to American 
ways," said Donikian, who came to the United States from Lebanon 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Getting used to those ways has been tough going for many of Pasadena's 15,000 
Armenians. Refugees from discrimination in the Middle East and repression in 
the Soviet Union, most arrive with little knowledge of English and few job 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Pasadena has accepted them with extraordinary generosity, Armenian leaders 
say. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the Board of Directors gave Armenians a special protected status in 
awarding city contracts and recruiting for city jobs. Now, a polling firm is 
conducting the first-ever Armenian census to implement an affirmative action 
program. 
</P>
<P>
It has not been easy sledding, said Serge Samoniantz, whose firm is doing the 
census. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who have had experience with local government in the Soviet Union are 
extremely distrustful of anything that smacks of government," Samoniantz said. 
</P>
<P>
A hard right onto Sierra Madre Boulevard, and the parade comes to rest in 
Victory Park, where the colorful floats are then put on display. 
</P>
<P>
It's an appropriate resting place. Eastern Pasadena is the middle-income, 
home-owning bedrock of the city. The residents here are civil servants, 
contractors, small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks east of Victory Park is Upper Hastings Ranch, a hillside 
neighborhood of winding streets and slanted roofs. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday season is their neighborhood's time to shine. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 34 years, residents have lit up the night with a torrent of 
Christmas lights. So extravagant is the display that tour buses and long lines 
of cars edge through narrow streets. 
</P>
<P>
Committees impose unifying themes on each block -- Cartwright Street has the 12 
Days of Christmas -- and a panel of judges awards prizes for the best use of 
lights and the best humorous display. 
</P>
<P>
The Upper Hastings Ranch "light-up," as residents call it, is brilliant but, in 
the end, ephemeral. From her front lawn, Dottie Csik, whose evergreen bushes 
are seeded with tiny white lights, takes in the short-lived illumination. 
</P>
<P>
"After New Year's, it's like a morgue around here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rose Parade Starts at 8:10 A.M. 
</P>
<P>
The 101st Tournament of Roses Parade begins at 8:10 a.m. at Orange Grove and 
Del Mar boulevards, proceeds east along Colorado Boulevard to Sierra Madre 
Boulevard and ends at Paloma Street about two hours later. Post-parade viewing 
opens at 1:30 p.m. For more information, the parade hot line is (818) 584-5983.

MAN FATALLY STABBED IN PIZZA RESTAURANT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: VICTIM CRASHES CHILD'S BIRTHDAY PARTY AND ARGUES WITH HIS ESTRANGED 
GIRLFRIEND, THE BOY'S MOTHER. SHE IS ARRESTED.

<P>
A man was fatally stabbed by his estranged girlfriend after he crashed a 
birthday party for her 3-year-old son Saturday night at a crowded family pizza 
restaurant in Granada Hills, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bridges, 28, a millwright from Apple Valley, was stabbed once or twice 
in the chest in a quarrel with Cynthia Stafford, 23, of Pacoima, Los Angeles 
police Detective Ken Buscarino said. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges died at about 8:30 a.m. Sunday at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Stafford, who was described as unemployed, was being held without bail on 
suspicion of murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had lived together about six months before breaking up and Bridges 
apparently went to the restaurant to try to revive the relationship, Buscarino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The detective said Stafford went to the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theater 
with her son, about five other children and as many as 10 adult friends and 
relatives. Bridges showed up, uninvited, at about 7:30 p.m.. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not the boy's father, but he had apparently befriended him when he was 
with the mother and somehow learned about the party," the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had a lengthy argument, Buscarino said. Stafford left the restaurant 
and walked to a nearby supermarket, where she bought a 10-inch steak knife and 
returned, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
The stabbing took place about 9 p.m. near a salad bar in a dining room, some 
distance away from the youngsters at the birthday party, who apparently did not 
witness it, Buscarino said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the detective added, officers interviewed about 10 eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure a lot of people saw it and grabbed their kids and left as fast as 
they could," Detective John Birrer said. "I'm surprised as many people hung 
around as they did by the time we got there." 
</P>
<P>
Buscarino said Bridges was aware that Stafford had a knife, but "he may have 
thought she was just threatening him. But he was wrong. She did him in. 
</P>
<P>
"It went down quickly," the detective said. "Bridges got stabbed and he didn't 
fall down or scream. He was able to stand upright until his friends in the 
party drove him to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Stafford's son was placed in the custody of his maternal grandmother, Buscarino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman, who identified herself as Stafford's mother, said she was at work 
several weeks ago when her daughter phoned to report that Bridges was at the 
Pacoima home Stafford and her son share with her. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just banging on the door. Pounding, pounding, pounding. I could hear it 
through the telephone," the woman said. "I told my supervisor I had to leave 
because somebody's trying to break into my house. When I got here, he was still 
pounding. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, he's a damn nut, and I guess she is too," the woman said of the victim 
and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was her baby's birthday party. This is what it started out as. And it 
turned into a tragedy."

Imagine a world in which short children are treated with a drug to make them 
taller. Although it borders on the Brave New World -- depicted in the 1930s 
novel by Aldous Huxley in which human embryos were tampered with so that they 
developed standard traits -- the technology necessary to turn this science 
fiction into fact is already being explored. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, physicians have been treating some midget children with growth 
hormone extracted from human cadavers to boost their height by the time they 
reach adulthood. (Unlike dwarfs, who have disproportionately large heads in 
relation to their limbs and torso, midgets are proportionately short). 
</P>
<P>
But only since 1985 has genetic engineering made it possible to generate the 
hormone in large enough quantities to be used for short children who are 
growing so slowly that they are not expected to reach more than 5 feet, 3 
inches if they are boys or 4 feet, 10 inches if girls. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md., 
is currently conducting clinical tests to assess the effectiveness of growth 
hormone in these "normal" children, who, unlike midgets, do not have a classic 
growth hormone deficiency. The results will not be in for at least 10 years, 
but that has not stopped some doctors from using the therapy on such children. 
</P>
<P>
The use of growth hormone is presenting an ethical dilemma in a society that 
often measures the worth of people by their height. Others argue that no 
substance, regardless of one's ethical point of view, should be used widely 
until it is proven safe and effective. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent state-of-the-art conference on growth hormone therapy sponsored by 
the Swedish Medical Research Council in Stockholm, about the only point 15 
experts on the therapy could agree on was that tests used to detect a growth 
hormone deficiency are not reliable, said Louis Underwood, a University of 
North Carolina pediatric endocrinologist who attended the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Without dependable tests, physicians cannot separate children who are growing 
slowly because of a medical condition that is stemming their growth hormone 
production from children who are merely following a family tradition of being 
short. While it makes sense that physicians should correct the former, treating 
genetically short children with the hormone raises thorny ethical issues. 
</P>
<P>
Short stature is not necessarily a disease, points out Leona Cuttler, a 
University of Chicago pediatric endocrinologist in an article in the Journal of 
the American Medical Assn. last year, but part of the normal variation in human 
appearance. Physicians who try to boost a normal short child's height with 
growth hormone may be likened to plastic surgeons who try to improve appearance 
with nose jobs and tummy tucks. 
</P>
<P>
But consenting adults submit to these cosmetic procedures, not children. 
Because growth hormone therapy is only thought to be effective in children and 
not full-grown adults, a child's parents and physician must decide if he should 
be treated. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very careful when deciding whom to treat," says pediatric 
endocrinologist Gilbert August of George Washington University. "Often it isn't 
the kids who are worried about being short, but their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"These parents, who are short themselves, vicariously relive through the child 
their own failures in high school about not being able to make the team, etc. 
I've often joked that if you could just do a 'parentectomy' these kids would be 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
But even without parental pressures, short stature can be emotionally costly in 
our society, which values height. "The money you save by not giving growth 
hormone," says August, "you may as well give to a psychiatrist." 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists cite studies showing success is tied to height, with taller 
people making more money or having more prestigious jobs on the average than 
shorter individuals. The midgets who portrayed the munchkins in the movie "The 
Wizard of Oz," for example, earned less money than the dog Toto. 
</P>
<P>
Short height, however, is a relative term that is dependent on the range of 
height in a population. When August told a group of dwarfs, for example, about 
the possibility of using growth hormone to boost a normal but short boy's final 
adult height from 5 feet, 1 inch to 5 feet, 3 inches, they were horrified. 
"People 5 feet tall are like giants to dwarfs who typically aren't taller than 
4 feet, 3 inches," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
By definition, a child is short if he is in the lowest 5% of height in a normal 
population. But if doctors were able to effectively treat all these children 
with growth hormone, they would not eliminate short stature but rather create a 
new crop of short kids -- there will always be someone in the short range of 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
"Where to draw the line and decide whom to treat with growth hormone is a 
dilemma we're struggling with right now," says pediatric endocrinologist Susan 
Rose of the University of New Mexico Medical Center in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of growth hormone therapy is also an issue. "We're talking 
$60,000 to $70,000 per inch," says pediatric endocrinologist Melvin Grumbach of 
UC San Francisco. "Is a few inches worth the equivalent of what it costs to 
send a kid to college?" 
</P>
<P>
Another reason not to treat a normal short child with growth hormone, Grumbach 
added, is that "the jury is still out" on the effectiveness and long-term 
safety of the therapy used on these children. "If you know a therapy is 
effective and has no risk tied to it, you do it," says endocrinologist Gordon 
Cutler of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. "But if 
both the risk and the effectiveness are uncertain, you should do nothing and 
let nature take its course, or you should enroll the patient in a clinical 
trial so we can learn what the risks and benefits are." 
</P>
<P>
There are no clear-cut health risks associated with growth hormone therapy, but 
there are some unconfirmed findings that indicate the therapy -- which usually 
consists of three injections of the hormone per week for several years -- might 
boost a person's chances of developing diabetes, hypothyroidism or leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"If we knew the therapy would give a person a four-inch gain in their final 
adult height rather than just a two-inch gain, the risks are probably worth 
taking," says Cutler, "but we don't know that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Since most normal children who have been tested with growth hormone therapy 
have not reached adulthood yet, their final gain in height is not known. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the parental pressure on pediatricians to treat more short 
children with growth hormone is building. "Unfortunately, everybody imbues 
growth hormone with magical qualities because we value growth so much," says 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
What decisions pediatricians make on whom to treat with growth hormone will 
have bearing on the use of future therapies likely to be developed to boost the 
appearance rather than the health of children. "If pediatricians do not respond 
to these dilemmas thoughtfully, carefully and forcefully," Cuttler wrote in her 
article, "other decision makers, whose decisions may reflect political, social 
or market forces, may then respond in ways that do not reflect the best 
interests of children."

Bone marrow transplants are helping treat some women with advanced stages of 
breast cancer, researchers from the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in 
Baltimore reported at the recent San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 140,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of these patients have a recurrence of the disease in other organs, 
such as the liver, the brain and the lungs. At present, there is no effective 
treatment for advanced breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But an autologous bone marrow transplant -- in which a portion of the patient's 
own bone marrow is removed, treated chemically to kill cancer cells and 
reimplanted -- could help some of these women. With their highly sensitive bone 
marrow removed, the patients are better able to tolerate higher doses of 
cancer-killing drugs, which are then more effective at knocking out the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, oncologist Nancy Davidson and her colleagues have performed this 
procedure on 20 patients with advanced breast cancer. Nine patients have 
responded completely; 11 showed partial responses during nine months of 
follow-up after the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen centers are using the marrow transplants to battle advanced 
breast cancer at a cost of $75,000 to $100,000 per patient.

DIVERSE L.A. DRUG CULTURE THREATENS AIDS OUTREACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Rosas and Ronny Alvarado were out trawling for hypes in a wild pocket of 
downtown Los Angeles, carrying the message about AIDS and dirty needles to an 
urban prairie where an addict can get high for as little as 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
A man squatted on the curb, pumping heroin into a dappled arm. Nearby, another 
guided a skillet over an open fire, sauteing fish. People stood, slumped, 
against a chain-link fence, smoking cocaine. A woman flashed a leering grin at 
Alvarado. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado approached her. Had she heard about AIDS? Did she know the risks of 
dirty needles and unprotected sex? Could she use a few condoms? Nope, the woman 
retorted perfunctorily: She was a woman; she didn't need one. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy spreading the word about AIDS to intravenous drug users, now a 
prime target of the epidemic in Los Angeles County. The obstacles range from 
the life styles of many addicts to the complex culture of drug use in the 
nation's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
Geography is destiny in Los Angeles County: The sprawl of the region has shaped 
the drug market, and thus the AIDS epidemic. The county's vastness has slowed 
the spread of AIDS among drug users, but it is making it difficult to reach 
those at greatest risk. 
</P>
<P>
In East Coast cities like New York, intravenous drug use is centralized. 
Hundreds of addicts share needles daily in shooting galleries. As a result, 
more than half of New York City's estimated 200,000 addicts are believed to be 
infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
But that same density makes addicts easy to find. Public health workers 
routinely canvass the shooting galleries of cities such as New York and Newark. 
They have alerted addicts to the risk of AIDS and thus helped cut down on the 
sharing of contaminated needles. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, by contrast, there are few places, except Skid Row, 
where addicts congregate in large numbers. Drug use is spread out and tends to 
occur among small groups. Those who share needles tend to do so with a few 
friends, again and again. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, and the fact that the virus came late to the West Coast, the 
HIV infection rate among addicts here appears to have remained relatively low. 
Just 3% to 5% of the county's estimated 80,000 to 120,000 intravenous drug 
users are infected, researchers believe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Reach 
</P>
<P>
But that same diffuseness makes it difficult to reach users. They are scattered 
all over the county, only occasionally in pockets. Public-health workers find 
themselves forced to go door to door, scouring neighborhoods for an entree, 
hoping to happen upon a user. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs, too, create obstacles to spreading the word. Their role in drug dealing 
creates risks for public health workers in some areas. Most outreach workers 
say they avoid working after dusk -- the time when, some acknowledge, addicts 
are most accessible. 
</P>
<P>
The county's cultural mix makes their task even more complex. In some Latino 
communities, experts say addicts are inadvertently protected. Sheltered at 
home, rather than forced out, they are harder to reach. Their families may 
offer the only access. 
</P>
<P>
"Intravenous drug use is happening all over," said John L. Brown, who runs one 
of the five county-funded programs doing outreach with addicts. "But it 
manifests itself differently depending on culture, socioeconomic circumstances 
and even the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"So what really burns me is people from San Francisco and New York who say, 
'This is how you do street outreach,' " said Brown, director of the Los Angeles 
Centers for Alcohol and Drug Abuse. "It's a much more complicated problem than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
But without effective outreach, experts believe infection inevitably will 
spread. 
</P>
<P>
Many addicts here admit they still share needles and syringes. Those who use 
bleach to sterilize their equipment say they do so only intermittently. Many 
use condoms only rarely, yet condoms offer the only means of avoiding infection 
during sex. 
</P>
<P>
One preliminary survey of 100 addicts in the San Fernando Valley found that 
needle-sharing remains common. Yet use of bleach to clean needles was 
relatively rare. Many of the users surveyed had multiple sex partners or 
frequented prostitutes, but few reported using condoms. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, county-funded AIDS outreach workers remain barred by the Board of 
Supervisors from giving out condoms or bleach -- an approach used widely 
elsewhere in the United States and abroad and credited with having helped 
change addicts' behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Among the homeless, activists believe drug use is rising. Among bisexual drug 
users, as many as 30% to 40% may be infected, researchers say. Some say there 
may also be a "microepidemic" of infection among the county's prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the field see a rise in "dual addiction," especially among 
Mexican-American addicts -- the supplementing of a heroin habit with low-priced 
cocaine. They find that ominous: Dual addiction is especially risky and can be 
more difficult to treat. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment -- getting off drugs -- is the ultimate form of AIDS "risk 
reduction." But access to programs remains a problem in the county. The wait 
for admission to a subsidized program ranges from weeks to months. And the 
price often serves as a powerful deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes people comfortable (ignoring the threat of AIDS for addicts) is the 
thought that if they wanted help, they could get it," Brown said. "The reality 
is, if they all decided to kick, there's nothing for them." 
</P>
<P>
How fast the AIDS virus is spreading among drug users is not entirely clear. 
</P>
<P>
M. Douglas Anglin, who heads UCLA's Drug Abuse Research Group, has studied 
rates of infection among addicts in treatment. His findings and others suggest 
that perhaps 2% were infected in 1986 and that the rate is still below 5%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
History of Drug Use 
</P>
<P>
According to those studies, the virus appears to be "pooled" among male 
intravenous drug users with some history of homosexual activity, and among 
women intravenous drug users with some history of prostitution, Anglin said. 
</P>
<P>
But some authorities have wondered whether the findings are reliable; that is, 
are addicts in treatment representative of addicts on the street? If men and 
women in treatment are less likely to be infected, the overall rate could be 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Anglin expressed confidence in the data. He said the county could have as much 
as a three- to-five-year grace period before the infection rate reaches that 
critical 6% to 8% level at which a rapid rise could be expected to occur. 
</P>
<P>
Who are the drug users at risk in Los Angeles County? They are as diverse as 
the county itself. They include longshoremen, physicians, mothers, truck 
drivers and prostitutes, from San Pedro and East Los Angeles to the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Their drugs of choice, and their using patterns, vary widely. Heroin remains 
dominant among Latino addicts, experts say. Cocaine has eclipsed heroin in the 
black community. Both those drugs, as well as methamphetamine and PCP, are 
widely used by Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
The following sketches hint at the extraordinary diversity of drug use in Los 
Angeles County. While the people profiled have escaped infection, their stories 
illustrate the insidious power of addiction and a life style with potentially 
lethal consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Take Cheryl, a 33-year-old mother of three from East Los Angeles, who asked not 
to be identified by her real name. Experts in drug addiction say her experience 
is common among women addicts: They fall into drug use on the heels of men. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl grew up in East Los Angeles, one of five children. Her father is a 
transit worker; one sister is an aspiring wrestler. She completed high school 
and, she says, she had little interest in drugs until she met the man who would 
become her second husband. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, faced with his growing addiction, Cheryl tried heroin. It was a 
reckless bid for attention; his drug use seemed to have shouldered her out of 
his life. She followed him into the bathroom where he was fixing, and insisted 
he inject her too. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Cheryl used only occasionally. But when her husband began 
dealing, they both began using more often. Emerging, horrified, from a two-week 
binge, she resolved to quit. But when she tried, she became violently, 
intolerably sick. 
</P>
<P>
After her husband was sent to prison, Cheryl tried to control her habit. She 
held down a job and cared for her children. Then one day, an old connection 
showed up at the furniture warehouse where she worked. As a favor, he gave her 
some heroin to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl began dealing, and used up the rest of the supply. From there, she slid 
into prostitution. She lost jobs, was sent to jail and was briefly cut off by 
her family. She remembers spending Christmas on her parents' front porch, 
barred from the house. 
</P>
<P>
"In this type of life, it's nothing but an evil merry-go-round," she said 
recently, in an interview at a methadone-maintenance program where she is 
enrolled. "It's a vicious master, you go in a circle. It's a never-ending 
circle." 
</P>
<P>
A similar tale comes from a man who asked to identify himself only as Doc, a 
35-year-old psychologist living in Los Angeles County. He began using heroin 
while working as a drug-addiction researcher at a prominent Southern California 
university. 
</P>
<P>
Intrigued by the world of the men and women he was interviewing in motel rooms 
throughout the state, Doc began experimenting with heroin. He compares his 
curiosity to that of an apple researcher who has never tasted the fruit: "I 
wanted to taste the apple." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he began using more frequently, driving from his home in the San 
Fernando Valley to the heart of East Los Angeles to score. Even after his wife 
overdosed, and with a 10-month-old child at home, Doc found himself powerless 
to quit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding His Life 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, he entered a residential treatment program. His wife had left 
him, taking their child. He was having difficulty holding down jobs. He has 
remained clean ever since, he says, and is in the process of piecing together 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
"It will kill you," said Doc, who, like Cheryl, escaped without becoming 
infected with the human immuno-deficiency virus, which causes AIDS. "If you're 
lucky, it will only kill you psychologically. So you have a chance for another 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to stereotypes, the life of an addict can be cruelly demanding -- in 
ways that make it difficult to get the AIDS message across. It is a life in 
which immediate needs eclipse longer-term goals, in which caution is not a top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
Many addicts, for example, rise before dawn to get high. Then they turn 
immediately to the urgent business of securing their next fix -- a task that 
may entail shoplifting, theft, prostitution, moving hot goods, wheeling and 
dealing, or selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Rosas, a former addict, supported his habit for a time by ripping off 
other addicts, peddling crack vials filled with soap or peanuts. He became so 
hated on the streets that, he recalls, he could only come out at night, his 
head covered by a hood. 
</P>
<P>
Personal hygiene, even eating, often fall by the wayside. Many addicts have 
chronic health problems, from tooth decay to liver and lung disease. Suspicious 
of institutions, and sometimes mistreated by doctors, many shy away from 
medical clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reality outside of the next two to three hours," said Barbara 
Casucci, director of Cornerstone Health Services, a methadone program in Pico 
Rivera. "There's no long-term planning, no looking forward to Christmas or 
Easter. It's just how are you going to get through the next two or three 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, among others, AIDS outreach workers have a hard job. Just 
getting the attention of an addict on the street is no small feat. What should 
be a 20-minute presentation on AIDS and how to avoid it ends up abbreviated 
into a fleeting, one-minute rap. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the problem of vocabulary -- both language and lingo. In some 
communities, adults find it difficult to talk about sex. On Skid Row, phrases 
like "intravenous drug user" are jettisoned in favor of more graphic 
alternatives such as, "D'you slam?" 
</P>
<P>
Bleach and condoms, many outreach workers say, would make their job easier. 
They would catch addicts' attention and give them something for their time. 
They would also serve as invaluable tools in explaining precisely how to 
protect oneself against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of those tools, outreach workers fall back on the power of 
repetition. By being visible on the streets, and offering repeated reminders, 
they hope they will eventually get across their point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ongoing Process' 
</P>
<P>
"These people are busy. They're trying to get money, trying to get paid, trying 
to get high," said Rosas, who does outreach along Skid Row for Brown's agency. 
"It's an ongoing process. No one's going to learn this in one shot." 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon this month, Rosas threaded his way down the crowded sidewalks of 
downtown Los Angeles making his regular rounds -- past the park where addicts 
gather, past the curbside cardboard dormitories, past hotels where 
transvestites co-habit, four to a room. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling with him was Ronny Alvarado, a 20-year-old former addict who works 
with the Homeless Outreach Project, a Skid Row agency that, among other things, 
accompanies AIDS outreach workers and makes available free condoms and bleach. 
</P>
<P>
(That agency's funding comes from the city, not the county. So it is not bound 
by the county supervisors' ban on distributing condoms and bleach.) 
</P>
<P>
The two men loped through the streets, greeting familiar faces, cajoling 
passers-by, scanning arms and necks for tracks. They offered pamphlets, 
condoms, information. Some people listened, others kept walking. A few 
protested, in mock offense, they were happily married. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't push yourself on nobody out here," explained Rosas, a 225-pound man 
with a buzz cut who put in his own time on the New York City streets. "You got 
to know when to step, when to go. If you don't, you may end up dead where you 
stand." 
</P>
<P>
Over the hills in the San Fernando Valley, three AIDS outreach workers from an 
agency called El Proyecto del Barrio were working Van Nuys, moving methodically 
from house to house on a run-down street where residents said drug deals 
regularly go down. 
</P>
<P>
There, the obstacles are different. Drug use goes on mostly behind closed 
doors. "The biggest problem is identifying where these people are," said John 
Paloma, 36, one of the outreach workers. "Then, when you've found them, it's 
convincing them we're not the police." 
</P>
<P>
The outreach workers watch for tell-tale signs: Cars pulling up outside certain 
houses, visitors returning one time too often. They ask questions: Any signs of 
drug use in the neighborhood? They hope their message makes its way into the 
right hands. 
</P>
<P>
In Paloma's experience, most addicts now know about bleach. Whether they use 
it, he cannot be certain. Most say they no longer share equipment, but Paloma 
remembers when he was using: Everyone shared because no one wanted to be caught 
carrying an outfit. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Paloma used to stash equipment around town -- for example, 
high atop public toilets. Now, working the parks, he occasionally runs a hand 
through those familiar crannies. When he comes upon a syringe, he leaves a 
pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
Are outreach programs working? In Los Angeles County, it is difficult to know. 
Most programs have been operating little more than a year. And there has been, 
so far, no comprehensive study assessing whether addicts' practices have 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
El Proyecto del Barrio, the agency that covers the San Fernando Valley, 
recently completed a survey of 100 intravenous drug users. The findings are 
preliminary and the study sample small, but the results indicate there is more 
work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharing Needles 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 75% of those surveyed said they share needles, at least occasionally. 
More than half said they clean their equipment with water -- which is 
ineffective. Only one third said they cleaned their equipment with bleach and 
water, the only proven method. 
</P>
<P>
As for sex, 33% said they had multiple partners. Nearly one in five said they 
frequented prostitutes. Yet most never use condoms and only 30% use them 
sometimes. Four people said they used them all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Changing attitudes and behavior takes time," said Kimberly Green, outreach 
project coordinator for El Proyecto del Barrio. "Eventually, they hit bottom. 
Then they become more vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
Those spreading the word say they have no grandiose expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out to solve the problem of AIDS," said Mike Neely, who runs the 
Homeless Outreach Project out of a storefront in the heart of Skid Row. "What 
we're trying to do is keep the person in front of us alive long enough to deal 
with their life. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can keep the person alive 'til they're ready to hear the message, maybe 
they'll be OK," said Neely. "If they die first, all we've got is a dead drug 
addict."

SAVANNAH, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this elegant old city of graceful mansions in muted tones, Bud Hall's House 
of Many Colors stands out like rap music at a Debussy concert. 
</P>
<P>
You can almost hear the hot pink, lavender and blue paint that covers Hall's 
nine-room Victorian home on Whitefield Square in the city's historic district. 
And his 9-foot tall windows look even louder, 10 of them covered with paintings 
of women dressed in colors of the rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
As expected in a city that prides itself on antebellum charm and architecture, 
a city that William Tecumseh Sherman spared after his March to the Sea because 
it was "too beautiful" to destroy, many Savannah preservationists look at 
Hall's home and see red. City officials took him to court, arguing that his 
home is not in character with the rest of the historic neighborhood. But Hall 
argues that preservation laws clash with his rights. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a room that he uses for his hair styling businesses, Hall said 
indignantly: "If I want to hang pictures of Zsa Zsa Gabor and Martin Luther 
King in my window, that's my right. Our country was founded on property 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Hall's house has come to symbolize increasingly worrisome issues 
surrounding the historic preservation movement. In Savannah, as in cities 
across the country, questions are being raised about whether the movement has 
become too powerful, too intrusive and whether preservation and progress are 
compatible -- and affordable. The questions take on added weight as aging 
cities increasingly rely on historic districts to attract visitors and help 
fuel their service economies. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, preservationists are battling to hold onto power they gained 
during the last several decades of heightened awareness of architectural 
treasures. 
</P>
<P>
In Charleston, S.C., and San Francisco, preservationists have taken a beating 
as they tried to convince some victims of the recent hurricane and earthquake 
that, in repairing their damaged property, they should spend the extra money it 
takes to buy materials like those destroyed rather than purchasing newer, 
cheaper ones. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Mellen of the Preservation Society of Charleston, said to be the nation's 
oldest such organization (70 years old), said, "You have to explain to them 
that you can put an asphalt roof on," instead of the more expensive metal, "but 
you're going to lose it in 10 years. You're also going to lose tourism" because 
the houses would not be attractive. 
</P>
<P>
In South Pasadena, Calif., homeowners -- backed by the National Trust for 
Historic Preservation -- struggle against a freeway that would destroy dozens 
of historic houses. One angry homeowner called that prospect "cultural 
suicide." The preservationists can lay claim to holding off the freeway for 20 
years, but they have not been able to kill it. The state continues to press 
forward with new plans. 
</P>
<P>
In Madison, Ga., preservationists sought to block the opening of a Hardee's 
hamburger shop which would result in the razing of two historic homes in the 
quaint old east Georgia town. But they lost. The restaurant now sits just off 
the town's main square, painted white, like many of the historic homes around 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only antebellum Hardee's in the world," said Don Stacy of the local 
chamber of commerce, adding that a Piggly Wiggly grocery store is located just 
across the street from Hardee's. "I wouldn't call it an antebellum Piggly 
Wiggly," he said, "but it is a quality construction with a quality appearance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influence Considerable 
</P>
<P>
For many years, the preservation movement made great political headway. And its 
influence is still considerable, even dominating, in many communities. 
</P>
<P>
The national trust has identified 11 areas nationwide that it calls 
"endangered," including South Pasadena, St. Simons, Ga., and the historic 
district in Deadwood, S. D. "These places tell us who we were and who we are," 
said National Trust President J. Jackson Walter. "They deserve our protection." 
</P>
<P>
But a backlash of sorts has been building, and nowhere is it more apparent than 
in Savannah, where a 2.2-square-mile historic district graced by live oak trees 
dripping Spanish moss boasts of some 1,100 historic buildings and 22 landscaped 
squares. 
</P>
<P>
Savannah is among the nation's oldest planned cities -- James Oglethorpe laid 
it out in 1733 -- and possesses one of America's largest urban historic areas 
designated as a landmark district by the U.S. Interior Department. Thus, the 
plight of its preservation Establishment could set a pattern for others 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Savannah, along with other cities like Charleston, San Antonio and Annapolis 
that have been working to preserve their history, are the recognized and 
acknowledged exemplaries of historic preservation," Walter said. "Were it ever 
to be the case when one of those cities changed direction sharply, we would, I 
am certain, be alarmed" that other preservation efforts might be thwarted. 
</P>
<P>
"When the leaders fall, everybody else gets nervous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sweeping Control 
</P>
<P>
Preservation officials exercise broad control over how a building is modified 
and over whether one is built at all in this city of 150,000. An 11-member 
Historic Board of Review that includes architects, builders and historians must 
approve "any type of alteration that is visible from the public right of way," 
said Beth Reiter, Savannah's preservation officer. 
</P>
<P>
The board is appointed by Mayor John Rousakis and the board of aldermen, 
serving three-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
The following changes are among those requiring a "certificate of 
appropriateness" approved by the board and issued by the zoning commissioner: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Demolition of a historic structure in the historic district. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Material change in the exterior appearance of" structures in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Moving a structure into, within or out of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Adding or altering awnings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Material change" of existing walls, fences or sidewalks that are "subject 
to view from a public street or lane." 
</P>
<P>
Under a section of the ordinance called "visual compatibility factors," there 
are 11 categories for judging new construction and proposed changes. They range 
from height to roof shape to the "rhythm" (relationship) of the buildings with 
other structures. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists argue that such considerations are not trivial, as they make a 
city palatable to visitors, thereby making money. "If we do not safeguard the 
character of our community, if we allow it to fray around the edges, people are 
not going to be interested in coming to see it," said Stephanie Churchill, 
executive director of the Historic Savannah Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Behaving Like Nazis' 
</P>
<P>
However, many here argue that focusing on the past is preventing progress for 
the future. The board is "behaving like Nazis or like czars," Hall said. 
"That's not what I want in my government." 
</P>
<P>
Many people here disparage preservation officials, and some have become local 
celebrities by defying city orders based on preservation officials' judgments. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Faber, a Savannah delicatessen owner ran up against the wrath of 
preservationists when he put up a red awning at his restaurant, located in the 
historic district -- despite the fact that his sandwiches passed strenuous 
taste tests. 
</P>
<P>
He won his fight, but his bitterness, tinged with humor, lingers. "Preserve the 
cemetery," Faber exhorts, "but don't put the businessman in it." 
</P>
<P>
One after another, he zings one-liners at preservationists: Having them sit 
around a table demanding to see paint samples is like "rearranging the deck 
chairs on the Titanic," and, "If the world stopped, it would take Savannah 25 
years to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
And just to rub in his indignation on city officials, Faber makes sure his 
bright red awning is well lighted at night, "so they don't miss it." His 
matching red window sign trumpets, in white letters, "Faber's. A Savannah 
Tradition since 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Walter of the national trust is unamused. Citing "the extraordinarily beautiful 
color of Old Savannah brick and the wonderful filigree of the wrought iron," he 
is against "turning your back on what makes the place special." 
</P>
<P>
Calling the current activist preservationist movement a "reaction against urban 
renewal," Walter said: "If there is anything we have learned over the last 20 
years, it is that the way you build a successful community is to make historic 
preservation part of the plan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sign of Trouble 
</P>
<P>
A sign of the diminished clout of the preservationists was the construction of 
the Hyatt Regency Hotel along the Savannah River earlier in the decade. It is 
modest by many cities' standards, but here its peach-colored, boxy architecture 
looms among the historic buildings. Built by local developer Merritt W. Dixon 
III, it stands 7 stories high and has 346 rooms. The promise of its substantial 
tax revenue as the city's largest hotel overcame bitter opposition from the 
entrenched preservationist Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
But no clash over preservation values here has been more remarkable than Bud 
Hall's. 
</P>
<P>
It began in October, 1987, when Hall tried out several colors on the Queen 
Anne-style Victorian home, which was built in 1896. All the colors were 
authentic from the Victorian period, Hall said the other day, showing a visitor 
a chart called "Victorian Hues." He originally selected five colors, including 
Public House, a robin's-egg blue, and Andover, a pink. At one point he even 
painted his tin roof in pink stripes. 
</P>
<P>
The Savannah Historic Review Board pounced on Hall, slapping him with a 
stop-work order, arguing that his paint job was out of character with the rest 
of the neighborhood. "Sof-f-f-t," said Hall, derisively. "They wanted colors 
that were sof-f-f-t. Well, the Victorians were not soft. They were extremely 
eclectic. They were whimsical." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute escalated, with Hall getting hauled into court and fined $100. Last 
year, he had an artist paint women on plywood panels, asserting that the panels 
were an energy-saving measure for his windows. Preservationists and some of 
Hall's neighbors hate the panels, but they remain on the windows. 
</P>
<P>
"The windows are not a typical treatment for that style house," said Reiter in 
unaffected understatement. "It looks like stained glass." 
</P>
<P>
The house's notoriety has earned it a stop on the tour-bus route, and sometimes 
the guide toots her horn at Hall, whose home is known as "House of Many 
Colors." 
</P>
<P>
Hall now talks of bigger battles with City Hall. "I want economic change in 
this community," he said, asserting that the preservation Establishment should 
be joining him and others in that struggle instead of mounting a paint patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize we need to attract business," said Reiter, but she argued that, in 
trying to curb Hall's eclecticism, she was trying to prevent "bit by bit, piece 
by piece, the unraveling of the historic district." Preservation and economic 
progress "are not mutually exclusive," Reiter said. 
</P>
<P>
But despite three decades of effort, preservationists have been unable to 
energize much of this city's commercial district, most notably Broughton Street 
and an ailing City Market, in the middle of the historic area. 
</P>
<P>
In one recent study, titled "Is Savannah Growing Senile?," a group of business 
and civic leaders calling itself Renaissance Savannah spared almost none of 
Establishment Savannah, criticizing business, political and media leaders. The 
report places the city ninth on a list of 14 Southeastern cities in population 
growth -- behind Orlando, Fla., Montgomery, Ala., and Augusta, Ga. The report 
likens Savannah to an "underdeveloped country." 
</P>
<P>
Said Julie Smith, a member of the group and a Chatham County commissioner: "The 
only industry that is growing is tourism. We need to get the city moving 
again." 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of surveys, a lot of talking, a lot of writing and not a 
damned bit of action," said one longtime business owner here. 
</P>
<P>
It is debatable how much of this restiveness can be blamed on preservationists 
blocking progress and discouraging people from coming here, but Reiter 
acknowledges that "we're the target right now. Preservation is a wonderful 
focal point." 
</P>
<P>
Bud Hall is doing all he can to keep it that way, although, he says, he has 
gone broke fighting City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
He said that after his many appearances in court, filing appeals and paying 
legal fees, he has been forced to file bankruptcy. "Lawyers aren't cheap," he 
said, estimating that his expenses have run "into the thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hall seems to relish his role as Savannah iconoclast. "I'm amused 
by the whole thing," he said. "I don't know what I'll do next."

From Savannah, Ga., to South Pasadena, the influential historic preservation 
movement finds itself battling to retain power. As the Column One story points 
out, the controversy is perhaps best symbolized by the "House of Many Colors," 
a Victorian home in Savannah that has preservationists seeing red. Hot pink, 
lavender and blue paint cover the house. Fueling the fire, owner Bud Hall,

energy-saving measure for his windows. MATTHEW STANLEY / For The Times

ISSUE OF JAPANESE RACISM GROWS WITH IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SCHOENBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>

TOKYO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chance encounter on a suburban train one recent Sunday sheds some awkward 
light on the elusive problem of racism in Japan. It began when a little 
Japanese girl pointed with fascination at a black woman and asked, "Daddy, 
what's that?" 
</P>
<P>
The father squirmed with embarrassment. He tried to satisfy the innocent 
curiosity of his preschool daughter by reminding her of an old Chinese fable 
known in Japan as "Saiyuki." The man prodded the child with the name Songoku, 
hero of the tale, which is popular among children. 
</P>
<P>
Songoku is a monkey. 
</P>
<P>
The young black woman apparently did not understand enough Japanese to catch 
the indignity of this literary allusion, but she grasped the meaning of the 
child's blunt question. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a person," she told the little girl in Japanese, "just like you." 
</P>
<P>
A tense situation dissolved into gushing smiles of international goodwill when 
it was further established that the woman was an American. The child was told 
she herself is a Japanese, and that was why they were different. 
</P>
<P>
After her new "friends" got off the train, the woman confided to another 
American that she felt more irritated than insulted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same whether they're 3 or 20 years old, they stare and point," said 
the woman, who had been in Japan about a year teaching English. "Japanese are 
all children when it comes to dealing with other races." 
</P>
<P>
The incident was isolated, and does not reflect how most Japanese feel about 
people of other ethnic backgrounds. But it offers a clue as to where some 
disturbing misunderstandings begin. 
</P>
<P>
Furor has periodically erupted in the American black community over the last 
several years at news that Japanese political leaders have made disparaging 
remarks about blacks in public. Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, for 
instance, drew heat in 1986 for saying America has a "low intelligence level" 
because of its black and Hispanic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese toy company, Sanrio Inc., was denounced and forced to withdraw its 
hot-selling line of "Little Black Sambo" dolls and beachwear last year after 
press reports described how these caricatures, with their thick lips and 
distorted features, were regarded here as cute rather than offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's insensitivity in matters of race does not end with negative black 
stereotypes. A recent boom in anti-Semitic books has continued without serious 
challenge from Japanese intellectuals. Members of Japan's ethnic Korean 
minority, mostly descendants of forced laborers brought here during the 
colonial period, still face discrimination in employment and marriage and only 
lately have felt comfortable using their legal Korean names. 
</P>
<P>
Now, stubborn attitudes of racial intolerance and xenophobia are bearing down 
upon the tens of thousands of Asians who have come to Japan, often staying 
illegally, to seek jobs at the lower echelons of this robust economy. While 
small-scale employers desperately need unskilled workers to correct a labor 
shortage, many Japanese oppose opening their borders for fear of increased 
crime and social disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a local newspaper disclosed the existence of an internal police 
report that singled out Pakistanis for contempt, characterizing them as smelly 
people with skin diseases who speak poor English, get mad when they are fed 
pork without being told and tend to "lie in the name of Allah" during 
interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely necessary to wash your hands after questioning or detaining 
(Pakistani suspects) because many of them suffer from contagious skin 
diseases," said the document, a partial copy of which was obtained by The 
Times. "Since they have a unique body odor, the detention and interrogation 
rooms will stink." 
</P>
<P>
Police officials have apologized to the Pakistani Embassy and said they will 
revise the 179-page report, which was distributed in November, 1988, to 
regional authorities by the National Police Agency's International Research and 
Training Institute for Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The intent of the report was to "raise awareness" about people of an unfamiliar 
culture, but it was badly worded, said Masahiro Tamura, a senior superintendent 
in the agency's international criminal affairs division. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a sudden rise in crime by foreign visitors, but we know so little 
about other countries, especially Pakistan," Tamura said. "We thought it would 
be a good idea to say a few things about what kind of country it is, and give a 
few examples." 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide arrests of Pakistanis increased by more than five times since 1985, 
to 78 cases in 1988. As many as 1,643 Chinese and Taiwanese were arrested last 
year, but they were not mentioned in the agency's training manual. 
</P>
<P>
Police are not the only ones with a low regard for Pakistanis, whose relatively 
dark skin makes them stand out among other Asian visitors drawn to Japan by the 
high yen and plentiful work. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Kawaguchi, an industrial city in Saitama Prefecture (state) with a 
large population of foreign workers, complained to a symposium on immigrant 
labor earlier this month that "some Pakistanis embarrass staff at public bath 
houses because they do not remove their underwear when bathing," according to 
Kyodo News Service. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Yoji Nagase also reportedly quipped that "Japanese people could bump into 
Pakistanis at night because of their dark skin." Nagase later insisted his 
remarks did not imply racial prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
In September, authorities at Warabi High School, also in Saitama, barred a 
19-year-old Pakistani from working as a teacher's aide in an English class. 
School officials told the Mainichi newspaper that the man was "a suspicious 
person" and that "there are a lot of communicable diseases and crime among 
Pakistanis." 
</P>
<P>
Similar bias is encountered by workers from Bangladesh, who, like those from 
Pakistan, were able to come to Japan as tourists -- without visas -- until 
Tokyo tightened its immigration rules in April. A new law will soon require 
foreigners to produce certification of visa status before they can work. 
Employers will be face penalties for hiring illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese consider themselves a single race, and they think their society 
will become dirty if foreigners come in," said a Bangladeshi businessman who 
has lived here for 13 years -- and who asked not be identified by name to avoid 
antagonizing his Japanese friends. "This attitude is deep in their hearts. 
There's no proof of it, but if you talk to people you're made to understand." 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, Japanese have considered themselves victims of racial 
discrimination for decades, and not entirely without cause. Japanese and 
Chinese immigrants were deprived of civil rights in the United States earlier 
this century during the regrettable era of "Yellow Peril," and a generation of 
Japanese-Americans was confined to U.S. concentration camps after the attack on 
Pearl Harbor in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of persecution weighed heavily in Japan's decision to go to war with 
the United States, and its territorial conquests were rationalized as an 
attempt to liberate the region from Western colonial masters. That view remains 
current among the powerful right wing of the political leadership, as 
illustrated last year when Land Agency Chief Seisuke Okuno was forced to resign 
his Cabinet post after declaring that Japan had justifiably fought against 
Asian colonization by the "white race." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, defenders of Japan's whaling industry routinely attack environmental 
critics as racially motivated, and some observers see the specter of racism 
lurking behind the emotional backlash by some Americans against the recent 
surge of Japanese investment in the United States. They point out that there 
are few complaints about corporate takeovers by the British. 
</P>
<P>
One hawkish lawmaker, Shintaro Ishihara, rattled nerves in Washington earlier 
this year by asserting in a book of essays that "racism is at the base of 
U.S.-Japan trade friction." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite this apparent gulf in communication, the Japanese have attempted 
to repair damaged feelings in some of the most highly visible cases of racial 
insensitivity. The Foreign Ministry issued a memorandum to the publishing 
industry in September warning of Jewish revulsion toward a recent spate of 
Japanese bestsellers that postulate Zionist conspiracies behind world events. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the books may "offend the most sensitive areas of Jewish psychology," 
the memorandum said. "The fact that such anti-Semitic works are published 
unchallenged and without criticism in Japan calls into question the common 
sense of the Japanese people." 
</P>
<P>
Government and publishing industry officials have so far responded positively 
to complaints, "partly because it's bad for business," said Neil C. Sandberg, 
director of the American Jewish Committee's Pacific Rim Institute, who recently 
visited Tokyo with a delegation of Jewish leaders. "But part of it represents a 
new understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have had very limited exposure to cultural differences for many 
centuries and developed a sense of uniqueness that tends to encourage either 
indifference or negative feelings toward foreigners," Sandberg said. "There's a 
vacuum here because there's so little information about the Jews. We're worried 
that these books may fill that void with negative stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
The potential for exporting intolerance also worries Sandberg, who noted that 
the work of one of the most scurrilous anti-Semitic writers, Masami Uno, has 
been translated into Korean. 
</P>
<P>
Questions also have been raised about employment practices of Japanese 
companies with operations abroad. Earlier this year, former employees of a U.S. 
subsidiary of Recruit Co., the job-placement firm of political bribery scandal 
fame, alleged that a secret code had been used to discriminate among applicants 
on the basis of race and sex. When a client wanted to hire a Japanese or a 
Latino, for example, the names "Mariko" or "Maria" were allegedly jotted on 
internal memos. 
</P>
<P>
In an echo of former Prime Minister Nakasone's slur about U.S. ethnic 
diversity, a significant number of Japanese -- two out of five -- believe that 
America's major economic problem is that it has too many minorities, according 
to a recent Harris Poll cited in the magazine Business Week. 
</P>
<P>
There are some encouraging signs of changing attitudes, however. Hajime Arita, 
a 10-year-old, and his parents started a family campaign to fight racism in 
Japan after reading about the "Little Black Sambo" controversy. They visited 
Washington in August to meet black leaders and promote better understanding. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese booksellers have removed copies of the children's book "Little Black 
Sambo" from their shelves, and several companies have joined Sanrio in phasing 
out products and designs featuring derogatory caricatures of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
But the caricatures, essentially borrowed from the symbols of America's own 
past, still proliferate on the Japanese landscape in signs and advertising 
images. 
</P>
<P>
One such eyesore is the sign outside a tiny pub in Tokyo's Ebisu neighborhood, 
which calls itself "Chibi Kuro Sambo" -- Japanese for Little Black Sambo. 
Inside is a log-cabin decor with comical black dolls displayed on the window 
sill. The Japanese waitress has her hair set in a style resembling African 
dreadlocks and wears a red gingham smock. Specialties on the menu are "little 
black fried chicken" and "little black potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
Owner Sachiko Sasaki does not see why there is such a fuss over the theme she 
chose for her pub nine years ago. She has no plans to change the name. 
</P>
<P>
"This had nothing to do with racial prejudice or how I feel about black 
people," Sasaki said. "I've always thought Little Black Sambo was cute." 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Bureau research assistant Takeshi Yabe also contributed to this story.

A Titan 3 rocket carrying British and Japanese communications satellites roared 
into space Sunday night after nine postponements as Martin Marietta Corp. 
entered the commercial launch business. 
</P>
<P>
The 155-foot-tall booster blasted away from its launch pad at the Cape 
Canaveral Air Force Station at 7:07 p.m. and gave thousands of spectators a 
dazzling New Year's Eve show, brilliantly lighting the night sky as it climbed 
toward orbit. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything looks good," mission commentator Bob Gordon reported as the rocket 
sped into space. Twenty minutes after liftoff mission director Vic Whitehead 
reported the Titan 3 upper stage carrying the satellites had achieved a 
successful orbit ranging from 117 to 437 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan got away on its 10th attempt. Originally set for Dec. 7, the launch 
was delayed once by a technical problem and eight times by strong, high 
altitude winds. The wind was no problem Sunday night and the countdown 
proceeded without a hitch to an on-time liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
Packed in the nose cone of the most powerful U.S. commercial rocket were the 
14,700-pound JCSAT-2 and the 3,230-pound Skynet 4 satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Skynet 4A was ejected from the Titan's nose cone into its planned preliminary 
orbit a little more than an hour after launch and JCSAT 2 followed about an 
hour and a half later. On-board rocket motors were to boost the relay stations 
to their operational altitude of 22,300 miles. 
</P>
<P>
JCSAT-2 will complete a two-satellite Japanese domestic network, providing 
telephone, television, facsimile and high-speed data services. It is owned by 
the Japanese Communications Satellite Co. 
</P>
<P>
Skynet 4 will be used by the British Ministry of Defense for communicating with 
land, sea and air forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese company and British government share the $125-million cost of the 
rocket and launch services provided by Martin Marietta. 
</P>
<P>
Roaring with power, the Titan's boosters burned out about two minutes after 
liftoff as planned and fell away into the Atlantic Ocean. The liquid-fueled 
Titan "core" vehicle then continued the ascent, looking like a brilliant star 
as the vehicle disappeared to the east. 
</P>
<P>
The flight plan called for Skynet 4 to be deployed from the Titan's 
second-stage nose cone one hour and 12 minutes after liftoff. JCSAT-2 was to 
follow suit about an hour and a half after that. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan 3, built at Martin Marietta's Denver plant, is the second big U.S. 
rocket to enter the commercial market, launching payloads for a fee. McDonnell 
Douglas was the first, with its Delta rocket hoisting a communications 
satellite for British Satellite Broadcasting in August. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics plans to enter the competition next year with its Atlas 
rocket. 
</P>
<P>
The three U.S. companies are competing with the European Space Agency's Ariane 
rocket.

POLK, Neb. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The land is tabletop flat between the Big Blue and Platte rivers, a good place 
to get a clear view of the world: the bright red and orange sunsets of summer 
and fall, the harsh winter winds that whip through small towns like freight 
trains, and, come springtime, the return of migrating birds and the lush 
prairie plant life. 
</P>
<P>
"To stand centered in a 360-degree horizon," Norris W. Alfred once wrote, "is 
to experience a natural worldliness, colorful and complete." 
</P>
<P>
Alfred, editor and publisher of the Polk Progress, not only mirrored the 
richness of the Nebraska horizon, but also used it as a place from which he 
could comment on the world. The demise of the 82-year-old weekly newspaper, 
which published its final issue last week, is being mourned by 900 avid 
subscribers in 45 states. 
</P>
<P>
The breadth of the subscription list -- including 75 from California -- is more 
of a tribute to Alfred than to Polk, which he described as a town of "384 
friendly citizens and one grouch." 
</P>
<P>
Alfred, 76, is a left-wing populist in a solidly Republican state who likes to 
rail against government secrecy, big businesses, big machines that destroy 
family farms, chemicals that deplete precious topsoil, and any Republican 
within striking distance. 
</P>
<P>
Many newspapers have creeds and slogans, but Alfred has a mantra, "Slower Is 
Better," which appears, along with a snail, on the masthead of the eight-page 
newspaper. Type for the Progress was set on a hot-metal Linotype and the paper 
was printed on a 100-year-old big cylinder Babcock printing press in a cramped 
Main Street office. 
</P>
<P>
The Progress could be anyone's hometown paper, featuring such pictures as Wilma 
Flick with her large turnip. But it's the features, mostly written by Alfred, 
that set the paper apart: the folksy Polking Around, the weather, an 
impassioned editorial and a bird-watching column; Alfred, who once supported 
himself as a water colorist, does pen-and-ink drawings for the paper. 
</P>
<P>
The birding column is an opportunity not only to count birds, but, Alfred said, 
"to point out the necessity for leaving trees, bushes and water in the land as 
part of the birds' livable environment. It's an extension of what students 
learn in kindergarten and maybe preschool -- sharing." 
</P>
<P>
The weather column is unusual because it is never wrong -- it eschews forecasts 
-- but it can make a political point: "This week's weather had Siberian 
temperature readings in the deep-freeze range accompanied by a secretive 
military mission of the space shuttle" (Feb. 7, 1985). 
</P>
<P>
Away from a typewriter, the soft-spoken bachelor observes that "loco" residents 
sometimes bristle at his politics, but they seem to have provided him with an 
endless source of good copy. None is more quotable than Alvena Lind, who is in 
her 80s and the leader of a three-woman team of paper folders, whose job is to 
crease and fold the sheets of the paper into a manageable whole when it comes 
off the press. A daughter once criticized Alvena for talking too much. "If you 
don't talk," replied Alvena, "you never say anything." She also campaigns 
regularly against sloth: "If you don't do anything, you get out of practice." 
</P>
<P>
Alfred, of Swedish ancestry, never had to worry about a work ethic. He writes 
most of his columns before the farmers get up. A Polk native, he worked briefly 
for the Progress after graduating from high school in 1931, and became an 
itinerant pressman and printer (he has a degree in chemistry from Doane College 
in Crete, Neb.). 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, he came back to Polk to help his ailing parents who owned a 
clothing store and several farms. In 1955, he bought the Progress with a small 
loan and monthly payments of $100. Alfred soon realized he had acquired a 
suspect printing business with old machines, a leaky roof and a precarious 
future. Then a farmer named John Hultman came in and renewed his subscription, 
telling Alfred: "I better pay for two years, then I don't have to come to town 
so often." 
</P>
<P>
With two years to prove himself, Alfred knew then his wandering days were over, 
except for a yearlong absence in the early 1960s. The Progress, by Alfred's own 
account, was not anything remarkable until the Vietnam War, when he decided it 
was pointless fighting the Vietnamese when the United States really wanted to 
fight Russians -- and said so. 
</P>
<P>
His national following started to build in the late 1970s when some San 
Francisco State University journalism teachers discovered Alfred (they 
nominated him for a Pulitzer Prize in 1980). 
</P>
<P>
Alfred announced his retirement last September and tried to sell the paper for 
$25,000, but couldn't find any takers. He may start a newsletter, but the 
Progress is gone.

The mayor of this northern town says that Roman Catholic Church officials have 
sent him a bill for more than $20,000 for a series of special Masses celebrated 
since 1630. 
</P>
<P>
The church said the town requested the special Masses in the 17th Century when 
it was troubled by the plague. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Giuliano Gaigher said Saturday that church authorities are now insisting 
on payment of 10,000 lire (about $9) for each of seven votive Masses celebrated 
each year since 1630. That would bring the total bill to about $22,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing historical research. We haven't found any commitment by the town" 
to pay for the Masses, Gaigher said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency ANSA quoted local church officials as saying they are 
willing to work out a solution.

<P>
President Bush on Sunday sent a television greeting to the Soviet people, 
offering "warmest greetings" for the New Year and for "a new world of our own 
making." 
</P>
<P>
In a video message to be broadcast on Soviet television, Bush praised Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as "a good partner in peace." 
</P>
<P>
A companion message taped by Gorbachev is expected to be aired on U.S. 
television, continuing an exchange begun by Gorbachev and former President 
Ronald Reagan in the mid-1980s. It was not immediately clear when either 
message would be broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the war-torn history of this century, we should redouble our efforts to 
forge a new century of peace and freedom," said Bush, who is vacationing in 
Texas but who taped the message in Washington before he left. 
</P>
<P>
Bush noted that "our nations have produced" leaders such as Abraham Lincoln, 
Soviet novelist Leo Tolstoy, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and 
Soviet dissident Andrei D. Sakharov. 
</P>
<P>
"We have persevered as allies in a terrible war," he said. "The challenges we 
face today are no less daunting. But with good will and determination on both 
sides, I am confident our two peoples will be equal to the task." 
</P>
<P>
Bush reiterated that the United States "seeks no advantage from the 
extraordinary changes under way" in Eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
With tears, clapping and shouts of "Viva Panama!" passengers made an emotional 
return to Panama on Sunday morning on the first commercial flight to enter 
since U.S. troops invaded and ousted strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"We made it. Long live Panama!" yelled one woman who joined some 200 passengers 
in wild clapping and cheering as Eastern Airlines Flight 4977 touched down. 
</P>
<P>
"Panama is so beautiful, so beautiful," she repeated over and over. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman, unable to contain her emotions, could do nothing but sob. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great. This is incredible," said one Panamanian businessman who has 
lived in self-exile in the United States since March, 1988. He said he will 
stay only a week now but plans to move back to Panama with his family by the 
end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Though all of the passengers interviewed said they were relieved that Noriega 
was ousted, many were nervous about criticizing him, and all asked not to 
quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
Omar Torrijos International Airport, named after Panama's previous leader, has 
been transformed by the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The Panama Defense Forces, which under Noriega took over control of the ports 
and customs and immigration services, had exercised absolute control over the 
facility, lending it a sometimes sinister atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers known for their opposition to Noriega were in the past forced off 
planes by members of the PDF, harassed as they passed through immigration or 
denied re-entry. Journalists were sometimes detained and interrogated by 
suspicious PDF officers. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, travelers reacted with pleasure as heavily armed U.S. troops offered 
New Year's greetings and the country's new civilian director of immigration 
welcomed them to "our new Panama." 
</P>
<P>
Jose Chen Barria, a member of the opposition Christian Democratic Party, was 
cheered when he introduced himself as the new immigration head and welcomed the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
Chen acknowledged that although immigration is now run by civilians, the 
airport remains under U.S. military control. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a military zone," he told passengers. "The U.S. Army is in control 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The airport had been a principal target of U.S. forces when their invasion was 
launched Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops brought the airport under control after heavy fighting, and a 
hostage standoff was defused when U.S. forces persuaded Panamanian troops to 
release two American women, saying Noriega had been captured. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, as the first commercial flight arrived, there was still evidence of 
a strong U.S. military presence. 
</P>
<P>
Armed servicemen met passengers at the door of the airplane. Others were 
stationed throughout the main terminal. Jeeps full of soldiers were stationed 
along the runways, and a U.S. military helicopter hovered nearby while the 
Eastern aircraft taxied to the terminal.

AQUINO RESHUFFLES CABINET BUT KEEPS RAMOS; 
</P>
<P>
PHILIPPINES: THE SHAKE-UP IS UNLIKELY TO SATISFY THE REBELS OR OTHER CRITICS, 
ANALYSTS SAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
One month after a coup nearly toppled her from power, President Corazon Aquino 
announced sweeping changes in her Cabinet on Sunday, including a new chief of 
the nation's much-criticized civilian intelligence services. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino removed seven of her 22 Cabinet ministers and moved several others to 
new posts. It was the broadest Cabinet shake-up since she assumed power four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Aquino did not accede to growing pressure to oust Defense Secretary Fidel 
V. Ramos, whose military has now mutinied six times against her government, or 
announce new policies to solve the nation's growing social and economic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet shake-up came as rebel leaders declared a cease-fire for the New 
Year's weekend, ending for the moment nearly daily rumors and press reports of 
another coup or assassination attempt. The Dec. 1-9 military revolt left at 
least 113 dead and more than 500 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said much of the Cabinet reshuffle appeared more cosmetic than 
substantive. They said it was unlikely to satisfy rebel leaders and military 
and civilian critics, who charge that Aquino's administration is corrupt and 
inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
But Aquino won critical support in a strongly worded pastoral letter that was 
read in thousands of churches before millions of parishioners Sunday morning 
across Asia's only Roman Catholic country. 
</P>
<P>
"The staging of a coup d'etat . . . is a rebellion . . . against God, from whom 
all civil authority is derived," the nation's bishops declared in the letter. 
"In other words, to seize power through a coup d'etat is a sin." 
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the faithful could not stand idly by during a coup, which 
it called "a morally neutral stand." 
</P>
<P>
The church leaders, led by Manila's archbishop, Cardinal Jaime Sin, conceded 
that there is abuse of power, incompetence and graft under Aquino. "Our 
government must get its act together," the church leaders warned, calling for 
"profound" and "thoroughgoing reforms." 
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised appearance, Aquino said that she reorganized her 
Cabinet to "adjust to new situations" and to improve deteriorating government 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Her spokesman, Adolfo Azcuna, later told reporters that the changes were 
"triggered not so much by the coup attempt but by the same reasons that 
precipitated the coup attempt. It's something you might say is parallel." 
</P>
<P>
Azcuna said the new Cabinet "should be an action team. The time for action is 
long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
The most significant change appeared to be the sacking of Rodolfo Canieso, who 
ran the National Intelligence Coordinating Authority, the Philippine equivalent 
of the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine intelligence apparently failed to detect the most recent revolt, in 
which an estimated 3,000 heavily armed rebel troops quickly captured the 
nation's top military bases and then laid siege to Manila's financial district. 
In his defense, Canieso said later that a majority of the armed forces did not 
oppose the coup. 
</P>
<P>
Before running the intelligence agency, Canieso was commander of the army and 
head of a right-wing anti-Communist group. Under his tenure, the army helped 
foster dozens of rural vigilante groups who were blamed for hundreds of human 
rights abuses, including brutal beatings and deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Canieso was replaced with retired Maj. Gen. Mariano Adalem, who also was named 
presidential consultant on military affairs. Adalem had commanded the 
Philippine army until he was appointed head of the National Casino Authority in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
But Aquino did not remove Defense Secretary Ramos or armed forces Chief of 
Staff Renato de Villa. Opposition politicians and even some of Aquino's closest 
aides had demanded that both be ousted for failing to forestall the latest 
military uprising. Ramos was a prime target of the coup attempt, and rebel 
leaders have made his removal a key demand. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos helped start the initial military-civilian revolt that swept Aquino to 
power in 1986. He has been her closest and most trusted military adviser since 
then and is considered a front-runner in the 1992 presidential election, when 
her term expires. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Magno, an associate professor of political science at the University of 
the Philippines, said Aquino could not replace Ramos easily, since he is the 
only civilian respected by a large segment of the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be unwise to make dramatic changes in the military now," Magno said. 
"It's not politically feasible. It might disturb a very precarious 
equilibrium." 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts said that Aquino's failure to remove several key aides was as 
noteworthy as the shifts she made. She did not, for example, replace Jose S. 
Concepcion Jr., secretary of trade and industry, or Mita Pardo de Tavera, head 
of social welfare and development. 
</P>
<P>
Concepcion's longtime tenure as trade czar has been marked by widespread 
accusations by foreign businessmen and local officials of inefficiency, 
incompetence and possible corruption. Concepcion broke into tears several 
months ago while defending himself in a congressional hearing, which examined 
allegations that his own companies had profited from his official actions. 
</P>
<P>
Tavera, who has served in the Cabinet since Aquino came to power, has been 
criticized even by Aquino's inner circle for failing to deliver basic social 
services in rural provinces. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts applauded Aquino's removal of Education Secretary Lourdes 
Quisumbing in favor of Isidro Carino, the highly regarded president of 
University of the East, one of Manila's largest universities. Quisumbing has 
presided over an education system that has seen illiteracy grow, a decline in 
the number of schools, a lack of textbooks and other major problems. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino also won kudos for replacing Transportation Secretary Rainerio Reyes 
with Oscar Orbos, one of the Philippines' most active congressmen and sponsor 
of a bill that would boost small business in rural areas. Under Reyes, public 
transportation in the capital has deteriorated dramatically in the past year, 
with a shortage of buses, rising fares and a series of crippling strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino moved her labor secretary, Franklin Drilon, to head the justice 
department. He replaces Sedfrey Ordonez, who had vowed to resign if he did not 
catch any "big fish" in corruption or organized crime by year's end. Although 
he did not succeed, Ordonez was named new ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
With the economy struggling to recover from the coup's bloody fighting, Aquino 
replaced both her finance secretary and the head of the central bank. She also 
named a new secretary to run the land reform program, which has been plagued by 
scandal and charges that the Aquino family sugar cane plantation used a 
loophole to avoid distributing land. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino also appointed new secretaries for agriculture, economic planning, labor 
and a new press secretary. Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, who will head 
negotiations on whether to renew leases for U.S. military bases in the 
Philippines, was retained.

Several fundamentalist Afghan guerrilla leaders were hanged at a public 
gathering inside Afghanistan for murdering about 30 moderate moujahedeen rebels 
last summer, a spokesman for the Jamaat-i-Islami guerrilla group said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Fundamentalist Hizb-i-Islami commander Syed Jamal Agha was hanged along with 
several other of the group's commanders in Taloqan on Dec. 23, Jamaat-i-Islami 
spokesman Umar Sherdil said, confirming reports published Sunday in local 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Sherdil told journalists that Agha and a "few" other Hizb-i-Islami commanders 
were publicly hanged in the city's main park in the presence of 43 leading 
elders from northern Afghanistan. He said that a large number of people 
witnessed the execution. 
</P>
<P>
The executions are the latest in a series of assassinations among moujahedeen 
guerrillas and politicians in Afghanistan and in refugee camps in Pakistan as 
Muslim fundamentalists struggle with moderates for control over the 5 million 
Afghan refugees and the rebel movement. 
</P>
<P>
A Jamaat-i-Islami member who claimed to have witnessed the executions said Agha 
was questioned in the park and accused by many people present of having killed 
their relatives and friends. 
</P>
<P>
The commander reportedly told them that he had killed hundreds of people in the 
fighting against Soviet and Soviet-backed Afghanistan government forces and 
couldn't identify them. 
</P>
<P>
He was also reported to have confessed his role in the murders of about 30 
Jamaat-i-Islami commanders and moujahedeen in an ambush last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Hizb-i-Islami is a hard-line fundamentalist Afghan guerrilla group seeking to 
create an Islamic state in Kabul. Jamaat-i-Islami, while also strongly Islamic, 
is more moderate. 
</P>
<P>
Hizb-i-Islami has been particularly envious of the charismatic and successful 
Jamaat-i-Islami commander, Ahmed Shah Masoud, who was reportedly the target of 
the massacre.

SINGAPORE'S PREMIER SAYS HE WILL RETIRE AT END OF 1990

Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who turned a colonial backwater into a modern 
industrial giant, announced Sunday that he will step down from the post he has 
held for 30 years before the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In his New Year's message, the 66-year-old Lee said First Deputy Prime Minister 
Goh Chok Tong will be his successor, ending speculation that he would 
immediately pass the post on to his son, Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien 
Loong. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, the country's first and only prime minister, has made it clear he is not 
retiring but has said in the past that he will become a senior Cabinet 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
Western observers expect he will retain veto power on all critical decisions 
and leave the day-to-day running of the country up to his handpicked second 
generation of leaders, including his 37-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Although Goh, 48, has said he expects Lee Hsien Loong to eventually follow him 
in the No. 1 job, he ruled out any interim label for himself by making it clear 
he expects to run for prime minister in the next election in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew, who has been in control from the time Singapore achieved 
self-rule in 1959 and full independence from Britain in 1965, said the country 
of 2.6 million residents "enters the 1990s with its people and leaders 
confident that they have pulled together when the going got rough, and can do 
so again." 
</P>
<P>
"For Asia and the Pacific, a sound relationship between America and Japan is 
crucial to stability and growth," Lee said. He noted this "may be more 
difficult in the future without a common threat from the Soviet Bloc," which 
has been swept by democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
He exhorted his countrymen to "let the 1990s be the decade when Singapore comes 
of age as a developed country." 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a decade of self-renewal," Lee said of the 1980s. "A new 
generation has assumed leadership positions in the Cabinet, Parliament and the 
public service. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the end of 1990, Goh Chok Tong will take over as prime minister," Lee 
said, in his most explicit statement yet about relinquishing the prime 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics, however, recalled that five years ago, Lee indicated he would retire 
at 65.

<P>
The city of Fresno filed a $650-million lawsuit against three international 
firms that sold the pesticide DBCP that ended up polluting city wells. The 
pesticide contamination has forced closure of nearly three-dozen city wells. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup costs could total tens of millions of dollars. City Councilman Craig 
Scharton said Friday that he does not believe taxpayers should have to foot the 
bill for a mess created by private companies. Named in the suit, which was 
filed in San Francisco Superior Court, are Shell Oil, Occidental Petroleum Co., 
Dow Chemical and distributors of the cancer-causing pesticide that was banned 
in the late 1970s but is expected to remain in San Joaquin Valley ground water 
supplies for the next 50 to 100 years. At least two other San Joaquin Valley 
cities, Sanger and Kingsburg, have pending suits against the pesticide 
companies dating back six years.

A small earthquake struck 24 miles southwest of Palm Springs. There were no 
reports of damage or injury in the magnitude 3.1 temblor, which was in a remote 
desert area, said Bob Finn, a spokesman for Caltech in Pasadena. The quake was 
not related to a series of small temblors that struck last week along the San 
Jacinto fault from San Bernardino to east of Palm Springs, Finn said.

Police in San Jose arrested the father of a 3-year-old boy who was jabbed by a 
cocaine-filled hypodermic needle while trying to break up a fight between the 
parents. David Kennard, 24, was arrested at his home and booked on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities planned to test him for any diseases that might have been passed to 
the boy through the needle. Tests conducted on the boy after he was stuck with 
the needle showed no significant amounts of cocaine had entered his system. 
Kennard and the boy's mother, Charlene Ann Lemon, were reportedly arguing about 
Kennard's cocaine use when the boy tried to stop the dispute, police said. 
During the argument, Kennard was waving a syringe and the boy was jabbed in a 
finger, officers said.

CONGRESSMEN'S AGENDAS FOCUS ON NATIONAL ISSUES; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: CLEAN AIR, IMMIGRATION REFORM, VIDEOCASSETTE COPYRIGHT PROTECTION 
AND AIDS TESTING ARE OF INTEREST TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among other items on his sweeping 1990 legislative agenda, Rep. Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles) aspires to overhaul the Clean Air Act and place stricter limits 
on agricultural pesticide residue on fruits and vegetables. He also hopes to 
require food manufacturers to provide detailed labeling of products and 
scientific support for health claims. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), meanwhile, is seeking immigration 
reform that would increase the number of visas for family members of permanent 
U.S. residents. He is also sponsoring a bill to ban "black boxes," which are 
used to make unauthorized copies of videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Among his modest legislative goals, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) 
continues to carry a measure that would empower federal courts to impose the 
death sentence for the killing of federal law enforcement officers. The same 
proposal failed to move in the last session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
These six measures are a sampling of the 54 diverse bills that the five San 
Fernando Valley-area members introduced this year and hope to see enacted in 
1990. The proposals generally deal with national issues rather than local 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some of the laws -- such as the Clean Air Act, immigration reform, 
videocassette copyright protection and Waxman's efforts to provide early 
confidential AIDS testing and counseling -- are of particular interest to 
Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, these health issues have impact on my constituents as they have on 
people throughout the country," said Waxman, whose 24th District includes 
Universal City and parts of North Hollywood and Los Feliz as well as the 
Beverly-Fairfax area, Hollywood and Hancock Park. 
</P>
<P>
The initiatives carried in the 101st Congress by Waxman, Berman, Gallegly and 
by Reps. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) and Carlos J. Moorhead 
(R-Glendale) reflect the lawmakers' legislative priorities as well as their 
place in the Capitol Hill hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman expects to pass some of his far-reaching bills, although struggles 
remain over important specifics; Berman may see provisions of his immigration 
bill incorporated into a broad reform package and would like to move other 
proposals, and Beilenson hopes that his politically risky measures in favor of 
a tax increase and public campaign financing will at least inspire discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Moorhead and Gallegly, as members of the Republican minority, face uphill 
battles over their narrower legislative priorities. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley members' initiatives are among 4,842 measures introduced by House 
members in 1989, the first year of the two-year session. Overall, 93 bills and 
resolutions have been enacted, which is typical of an institution that tends to 
creep along until adjournment approaches and then engages in a lawmaking 
frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, most proposals fail to negotiate the legislative labyrinth. Success 
often comes by folding the provisions of a bill into a broader measure that 
appears headed for passage, persuading senior colleagues to sponsor an 
initiative or influencing behind-the-scenes negotiations and policy committee 
actions. For Republicans such as Moorhead, this may mean getting a Democrat to 
adopt their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
And it often takes more than one session of Congress to get something done. 
Thus, many of the Valley-area lawmakers' proposals are carried over from 
previous sessions when they failed to go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time, for instance, Beilenson is sponsoring a bill to increase 
the federal gasoline tax by 50 cents a gallon over a five-year period to reduce 
the federal deficit and another to publicly finance congressional general 
election campaigns. For the fourth time, he has reintroduced a measure to 
double the safety standard for automobile bumpers. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the sort of thing he likes to leave there so people will talk about 
it," said a legislative aide to Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
After two unsuccessful attempts to expand patent protection for industrial 
designs of such items as luggage, telephones and automobile parts, Moorhead 
says that new-found backing by key colleagues and the Bush Administration may 
portend passage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we will get it through eventually," Moorhead said last week. "I 
wouldn't guarantee this Congress. We're building more and more support for it 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, a legislative power as chairman of the influential health and 
environment subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is 
carrying numerous major bills and plans to introduce others. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Clean Air, food labeling, pesticide and AIDS measures, he is 
pushing bills to establish standards and routine inspections of fish to detect 
chemical contamination; toughen the Food and Drug Administration's oversight of 
medical devices; increase the number of community residential programs for the 
mentally retarded and authorize Medicaid to pay for home health care for the 
poor elderly rather than restricting coverage to nursing home costs. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman said last week that he also plans to sponsor a bill to further restrict 
cigarette promotion and advertising and sale to minors. Stiff opposition from 
the powerful tobacco lobby is expected. 
</P>
<P>
This is not unusual. On many of his initiatives, Waxman is opposed by the Bush 
Administration as well as by private industry. 
</P>
<P>
A senior agriculture official testified in May that Waxman's bill to change the 
standard for cancer-causing carcinogenic pesticide residue on food from a 
balancing of health and economic concerns to strictly health considerations 
would have a disastrous impact on food prices and the food supply. The measure 
is one of several introduced in the wake of widespread fears prompted by use of 
the chemical Alar on apples. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, in turn, adamantly opposes a pesticide-control bill by the White House 
that would tighten registration requirements and stiffen sanctions against 
violators but would also prevent states from imposing more stringent pesticide 
restrictions. Environmentalists in California are seeking to place a tough 
environmental initiative on the 1990 ballot that would phase out all 
agricultural chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive injury by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman's subcommittee chairmanship has allowed him to assemble a large and 
respected staff, hold frequent hearings and aggressively pursue a liberal 
agenda that includes protecting consumers and fighting for benefits for the 
poor, elderly and infirm. 
</P>
<P>
He possesses "an instinct for the legislative process that is second to none, a 
thorough knowledge of the rules and willingness to exploit every one and a 
temperament that is all but unflappable," said the 1988 edition of "The 
American Almanac of Politics." 
</P>
<P>
Berman, an ally of Waxman's, has established clout on the House Judiciary 
Committee, particularly on immigration and copyright issues. As a member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, he also has become a player on some international 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Berman passed a far-reaching bill that prohibits all arms sales, 
whether publicly known or covert, to countries placed on a so-called "terrorist 
list" by the secretary of state unless the President provides Congress with 
prior notice and detailed justification. Berman introduced the measure in 
response to the Iran arms sales scandal. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to prevent the spread of ballistic missiles, he also has sponsored 
a bill to require the President to impose sanctions against companies that 
export missile technology in violation of U.S. export-control laws. Under the 
measure, which overwhelmingly passed the House this year, foreign companies 
that sell this technology to countries such as Libya or Iraq would face the 
prospect of being cut off from U.S. Department of Defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
On immigration, as Congress moves to revise the 24-year-old U.S. visa-allotment 
system, Berman is pushing for expansion of visas in general and is championing 
the reunification of family members of those who have become permanent U.S. 
residents. Berman maintains this should remain the cornerstone of national 
immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, have sought to shift the overall emphasis toward immigrants' 
education and employment skills. This is intended to open the doors for more 
Western Europeans, who have been largely shut out by the current system's bias 
toward regions with more recent immigrants, who thus have more immediate 
relatives in the United States. These regions include parts of Asia and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Berman is also carrying a bill that he has previously introduced twice. The 
measure, sought by the American Civil Liberties Union, would remove the 
President's authority to prohibit U.S. citizens from spending money in 
countries against which the United States has an economic embargo -- which 
effectively prohibits travel to places such as Cuba, Vietnam and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Berman passed a provision of his original bill last year that eliminated the 
ban on exporting and importing informational materials, such as films, 
newspapers and books, to and from embargoed countries. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson's significant legislative roles are, by their very nature, low 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
He sits on the important but largely anonymous House Rules Committee, which 
controls the flow of legislation and determines the limits of debate on the 
House floor. He is chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence, which provides oversight and approves the budgets for the CIA and 
other intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson tends to be less of a force on other legislation. His tax and 
consumer bills have languished. His proposals to publicly finance congressional 
campaigns have earned him renown as an advocate but have not led to any reform 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, such efforts have contributed to Beilenson's reputation as an 
independent-minded lawmaker willing to take politically unpalatable positions 
that are certain to wind up in election opponents' brochures. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson did win passage last year of a long-sought measure prohibiting the 
import of ivory and other pachyderm parts as part of international efforts to 
save the threatened African elephant. Under the measure, Congress can earmark 
as much as $5 million a year for elephant conservation projects; $300,000 was 
appropriated last year. Beilenson plans to ask for $5 million again in the 1990 
fiscal year, an aide said, but funding remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly, a two-term Republican, has yet to make a legislative mark. None of 
the handful of bills he sponsored in his three years has passed. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he picked up additional bipartisan support for his measure to 
authorize the death penalty for killers of police, judges and other law 
enforcement officials. Similar bills had previously stalled in committees but 
Gallegly maintained his was more narrowly drawn. 
</P>
<P>
He also sponsored a bill to deny federal student financial aid to individuals 
convicted of desecrating the American flag. It remains in the House Committee 
on Education and Labor. 
</P>
<P>
"He concentrated more of his attention to constituent service and building 
relationships with other members and familiarizing himself with the process," 
John Frith, Gallegly's spokesman, said of the former Simi Valley mayor's first 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Frith said, Gallegly's staff is exploring a series of legislative 
initiatives that may be introduced next year. 
</P>
<P>
These include a resolution putting Congress on record as opposing any 
consideration of legalizing drugs and bills to ban the manufacture, sale and 
importation of drug paraphernalia; to shift American troops no longer needed in 
Europe to Immigration and Naturalization border patrols and to give the 
President a line-item budget veto but allow Congress to override a presidential 
veto with a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
Moorhead, dean of the California Republican delegation, has introduced a 
measure to require customs agents to check the vehicle identification number of 
exported automobiles. He said this would cut down on car thefts that involve 
changing identification numbers and shipping stolen vehicles overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Another Moorhead measure would permit the INS to use volunteers for clerical 
and secretarial duties at border patrol offices. This idea, which Moorhead said 
was prompted by volunteer programs in Los Angeles law-enforcement agencies, is 
intended to alleviate a manpower shortage by putting more professional agents 
out on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Neither bill has gained any apparent legislative momentum. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his design patents proposal, Moorhead also has introduced a bill 
to provide a process for patenting products developed through space 
exploration. He said he is optimistic about its prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond his own bills, Moorhead said, he is often involved in shaping 
legislation as the ranking Republican on Energy and Commerce's subcommittee on 
energy and power and on Judiciary's subcommittee on courts, civil liberties and 
administration of justice. The latter assignment has led to his pre-eminent 
legislative specialty. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of his legislative work has been done on patent and copyright -- useful 
but scarcely fascinating matters like protecting American patent rights abroad, 
protecting the privacy of electronic mail and extending drug patents to give 
time for regulatory approval," according to "The American Almanac of Politics." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONGRESSIONAL BILLS PENDING 
</P>
<P>
Some legislation introduced in the 101st Congress by Valley Area 
Representatives: 
</P>
<P>
REP. ANTHONY C. BEILENSON (D-Tarzana) 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN FINANCING: Bill would publicly and fully finance all general election 
campaigns in the House of Representatives. Prospects: Measure failed to move in 
two previous sessions; partial public campaign financing considered a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
GASOLINE TAX: Bill would phase in a 50 cents-a-gallon increase in the federal 
gasoline tax over five years, raising $150 billion for deficit reduction during 
that time. Prospects: Dim, given President Bush's pledge not to increase taxes. 
</P>
<P>
REP. HOWARD L. BERMAN (D-Panorama City) 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION REFORM: Bill would increase visas for family members of permanent 
U.S. residents and for workers. Prospects: Under active consideration; likely 
to be merged with other immigration measures. 
</P>
<P>
VIDEOCASSETTE COPYRIGHTS: Bill would ban the manufacture and sale of "black 
boxes" that facilitate the unauthorized copying of videocassettes. Prospects: 
Berman seeking hearing early next year in House Judiciary subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
REP. ELTON GALLEGLY (R-Simi Valley) 
</P>
<P>
DEATH PENALTY: Bill would empower federal courts to impose the death penalty 
for killing federal law enforcement officers. Prospects: Bottled up in House 
Judiciary Committee last session; Senate Judiciary Committee passed broader 
capital punishment bill in October. 
</P>
<P>
REP. CARLOS J. MOORHEAD (R-Glendale) 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN PATENT: Bill would expand copyright protection for industrial designs of 
such items as telephones, luggage and automotive parts. Prospects: Moorhead has 
unsuccessfully introduced measure in two previous 
</P>
<P>
sessions but has new-found congressional and Administration support.

<P>
AUTO THEFT: Bill would require customs officers to verify identification 
numbers of vehicles before the cars are exported to make sure they are not 
stolen. Prospects: Uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
REP. HENRY A. WAXMAN (D-Los Angeles) 
</P>
<P>
CLEAN AIR: Sweeping bill would revise clean air legislation including urban and 
rural air pollution guidelines, toxic pollutants restrictions and acid rain 
controls. Prospects: Passage of a bill likely but high-stakes battles, 
particularly including over on alternative automobile fuels and acid rain 
provisions, remain. 
</P>
<P>
FOOD LABELING: Bill would require food labels to specify the amount of fat, 
cholesterol, sodium, protein and calories and manufacturers to provide 
scientific evidence to support health claims. Prospects: Waxman optimistic, but 
disagreements remain. 
</P>
<P>
PESTICIDE RESIDUE: Bill would change the standard for measuring acceptable 
level of pesticide residue on foods from a balancing of health and economic 
concerns to strictly health considerations. Prospects: Major fight looms, with 
Bush Administration proposing a bill more sympathetic to agriculture and 
chemical industries.

REMODEL: NEW AGUA DULCE FIREHOUSE BEGAN LIFE AS FAMILY HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Firefighters assigned to Los Angeles County Fire Station 81 in remote Agua 
Dulce find they can do most of their work from home. 
</P>
<P>
The home, in this case, is the station itself -- a converted three-bedroom, 
ranch-style house on Sierra Highway that serves a 60-square-mile area with a 
population of about 4,500. It houses two firefighters, a Fire Department 
engineer and a captain, each of whom spends an average of two 24-hour shifts 
per week in the cozy quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,200-square-foot house was bought by the county in 1986 to replace the 
community's aging fire station in nearby Mint Canyon, Fire Department officials 
said. It is one of only three such stations operated by the county -- the 
others are on Catalina Island and in the city of Walnut, said Randy Gomez, 
construction coordinator for the Fire Department. Two other county fire 
stations operate out of mobile homes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The house cost the county $250,000 -- about a third of what it might have cost 
to build a new station, officials said. The Fire Department spent an additional 
$50,000 to remodel the house. 
</P>
<P>
It's a nice change from the standard red-brick station, providing relaxation 
amid otherwise stressful working conditions, firefighters say. 
</P>
<P>
"On a comfort scale of one to 10, this is a 10," said fire engineer Allyn 
Holton, who regularly works at a much busier county fire station in Newhall but 
occasionally fills in at Station 81 when its engineer has to be away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more like a motel, instead of an army barracks." 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department planners built an office for the captain and installed a larger 
entrance, a microphone and loudspeakers for radio dispatches and a paper towel 
dispenser in the bathroom. But in most respects, the single-story house looks 
pretty much the way it did in its domestic state, said Capt. Ted Lindaman, one 
of three captains assigned to the station. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters enjoy the luxury of two fireplaces, a bathtub and a large kitchen 
with wood-grain cabinets and a built-in microwave oven. They pitched in for a 
large-screen television in the living room, and each bedroom has weightlifting 
equipment for fitness training. An outdoor satellite dish that came with the 
house improves TV reception in the mountainous area, Lindaman said. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much interior decorating to speak of -- the walls are generally 
bare except for a large map showing county fire station locations -- and family 
mementos have been replaced by a firefighter's first-place award for a local 
chili cook-off and a wood plaque that says "The Fighting 81st." 
</P>
<P>
The captain and engineer have their own bedrooms, and the two firefighters 
share the third bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 Fire Department employees are assigned to the station, though 
only four occupy the house at any one time due to shift changes, Lindaman said. 
</P>
<P>
The house caught the eye of Fire Department planners because its garage had 
been built to fit the previous owner's motor home and was large enough for a 
fire engine, Lindaman said. Also, a large, corrugated-metal storage shed has 
room for four reserve engines that can be put into service throughout the area 
if regular engines are being repaired, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the station's calls are for auto accidents on Sierra Highway -- an 
alternate route to the often congested Antelope Valley Freeway -- and 
occasional brush fires. In between, firefighters inspect water tanks for leaks 
and make sure that brush has been cleared near homes and businesses, Lindaman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The station handled about 400 calls this year, compared with about 3,000 at 
Station 73 in Newhall, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The homey atmosphere is nice for some, but others prefer a faster pace, 
Lindaman said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a nice station to be at," he said. "But if you're looking for a lot of 
action, you want to get out of here. This is not what you would call a fast 
firehouse." 
</P>
<P>
And despite the remodeling, some of the fixtures just aren't designed for the 
kind of wear and tear that fire stations have to endure, Lindaman said. At most 
stations, doors are designed to swing so firefighters can quickly exit to 
respond to emergencies, but the solid wood doors at Station 81 sometimes lock 
when closed, creating hassles when firefighters rush out of the house toward 
the fire engine, Lindaman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It has its advantages and disadvantages," he said. "This tends to alleviate 
some of the stress because of the atmosphere. But it's not really set up to be 
a firehouse. The fixtures are meant for a regular family. They're not meant for 
12 guys, day in and day out, going in and out." 
</P>
<P>
"You have firefighters who are dirty and grimy coming back from fires -- and 
the carpet has a tendency to get dirty." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the station are surprised to find out it's a house, Lindaman said. 
</P>
<P>
"People that stop in say 'Boy, this is pretty nice -- just like being at home,' 
" he said. "Well, it is, in a way. People have never seen a fire station like 
it." 
</P>

RIVERSIDE TEEN-AGERS HELD AFTER 125-MILE CHASE IN STOLEN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old Riverside boy was arrested early Sunday after leading police on a 
125-mile, high-speed chase in a stolen car before finally running out of gas 
north of the Santa Clarita Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth's 16-year-old girlfriend, a passenger, also was taken into custody 
following the chase, which began about 1:45 a.m. in Riverside, said Sgt. Mark 
Lunn of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside police attempted to stop the 1987 blue Mazda 323 after spotting the 
stolen vehicle at Washington Street and Overlook Parkway, Lunn said. But the 
car sped away, heading north on Washington Street, Lunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit continued to the westbound Riverside Freeway, where the California 
Highway Patrol took over the chase, which proceeded north on the Santa Ana 
Freeway at speeds of up to 110 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The chase continued through the San Fernando Valley and into the Santa Clarita 
Valley, where the couple left the freeway and headed west on Templin Highway, 
then north on The Old Road before running out of gas about 3 a.m., Lunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested on suspicion of grand theft auto, possessing stolen 
property, evading arrest, being a minor in possession of alcohol and for not 
wearing seat belts, Lunn said. The boy also was arrested on suspicion of being 
an unlicensed driver, Lunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy told authorities that he stole the car before picking up his girlfriend 
at her Riverside home to go for a ride, Lunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, whose names were withheld because of their ages, are being held at 
Sylmar Juvenile Hall, he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PACOIMA WOMAN SAVED FROM EMPTY CESSPOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacoima woman was rescued by Los Angeles firefighters Sunday after she fell 
20 feet into an empty cesspool, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Esquivel, 26, fell into the cesspool in the 8500 block of North Cayuga 
Avenue about 12:45 p.m., said Pat Marek, spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire 
Department. The underground catch basin near Esquivel's home had been opened by 
Los Angeles city workers for repairs, Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how the accident occurred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Esquivel suffered minor injuries and was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in 
Mission Hills, where she was treated and released, a hospital spokeswoman said.

<P>
NFC PLAYOFFS: L.A. OFFENSE SCORES ON FIRST TWO POSSESSIONS AND ALL-ZONE DEFENSE 
SHUTS DOWN CUNNINGHAM AND EAGLES.

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one ever said Buddy Ryan's team couldn't talk. Like coach, like team. The 
Philadelphia Eagles passed out opinions last week like business cards. 
</P>
<P>
Zone defense? If the Rams were sissies enough to try it, fine -- it's their 
reputations on the line down at the rifle club. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' defensive line? Couldn't be stopped. They'd swat the Rams from 
their path like moths from a doorstep. Super Bowl, here we come. 
</P>
<P>
Travel plans? If needed, the Eagles would be sunning in Santa Rosa this week in 
preparation for next week's divisional playoff game against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"They can go ahead and plan that flight to Frisco," Ram quarterback Jim Everett 
said, "but they ain't going." 
</P>
<P>
Not representing the league, anyway. The Rams ruined some great pregame 
material for round two with a 21-7 wild-card victory over the Eagles at 
Veterans Stadium on Sunday, earning a spot in next week's divisional game 
against the New York Giants in the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Not much to talk about, really. The Rams scored two touchdowns in the first 
eight minutes, could have scored two more in the next eight but didn't, then 
held on in typical hair-raising fashion, needing two Greg Bell bursts in the 
final five minutes to clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
Over Ryan's protestations about the sins of zone defense, the Rams proceeded 
with their coverage of Eagle quarterback Randall Cunningham. He was to them a 
blip on their radar screen, never to be lost from tracking. 
</P>
<P>
Unsporting as it seemed, the Rams played not a single down of man-to-man 
defense against the Eagles. Theirs was more a quarantine approach of patience 
and containment, and it worked well enough to hold Cunningham to 39 rushing 
yards and no touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said last week that any quarterback worth his salt could undress a zone. 
Sunday, he could only tip his cap to Ram defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur, 
who had caged Cunningham with nets, not bullets. 
</P>
<P>
On this subject, you might say Shurmur and Ryan, another defensive strategist, 
have differing opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"I disagree like hell with it," Shurmur said of Ryan's attack philosophy. 
"Physical is not described in terms of man-to-man or pass rush. Our guys are as 
tough as any group I've been around. These guys have been criticized, 
chastised; people have said what's a defense that's 21st in the league doing in 
the playoffs, all of those things. I think this was a great opportunity for 
them to show the world that, hey, we can play this game however you want to 
play it." 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side of scrimmage, the Rams' offensive line kept the heat off 
Everett. The Eagles' sack team of Reggie White and Jerome Brown bagged Everett 
one time each, but it wasn't the menacing rush of doom that had been predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Jackie Slater said the line has never been better prepared, and worked 
in uncommon unison to pick up stunts and blitzes. 
</P>
<P>
The line held the Eagles in check -- without holding any Eagles. The lone Ram 
penalty in the game, in fact, was a self-induced delay call to proffer a better 
end-zone angle for punter Dale Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson considered his line's work commendable, given the task 
at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Their line is very famous," he said mockingly of the Eagles' front four. "But 
they clearly had their hands full with our offensive line. You might call it a 
standoff." 
</P>
<P>
You might call it that; Robinson wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"You get to vote," he said. "But I thought we won. They said they were going to 
win the battle. I don't think they did." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' arrogance, born of their coach, rubbed many Rams the wrong way. 
Even the team's most guarded diplomat, Everett, admitted he took some of last 
week's Eagle chatter into the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell said he was taunted throughout the game by Eagles' safety Andre 
Waters, who jarred the ball from Bell's arms on a first-down carry at the 
Eagles' five in the first quarter, a crucial fumble considering the Rams could 
have moved ahead, 21-0, with a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"He just talked the whole game," Bell said of Waters. "It got to be kind of 
funny. He kept saying 'Four-two (Bell's number), I'm going to get you.' And he 
got me." 
</P>
<P>
Bell redeemed himself later, with the Rams clinging to a seven-point lead in 
the fourth quarter. Pinned at their own 16 with 5:44 left, the Rams craved a 
possession drive to work time off the clock. They kept the drive alive on third 
and four at their 21 on a 15-yard pass from Everett to Buford McGee. On second 
down from the 36, Bell took a handoff and broke the play outside. 
</P>
<P>
Bell: "Sometimes they spend too much time thinking about what to say, and they 
don't think about what their assignments are." 
</P>
<P>
Bell broke free down the left sideline and ran 54 yards before being dragged 
down by Izel Jenkins at the 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I was flying down the field as fast as Bo Jackson would," Bell 
said, "but I was getting down the field. I knew he was back there, because I'd 
seen him when I took off. He wasted a lot of time trying to strip me (of the 
ball), rather than trip me up." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins did strip the ball, but Bell was able grab the ball with his other hand 
before going down. 
</P>
<P>
Bell ran three yards on first down and then scored the game-clincher from seven 
yards out with 2:14 left, putting the Rams up, 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't top last week's 210-yard performance against New England, but this 
wasn't the Patriots' defense, either. Bell finished with 124 yards in 27 
carries, which was plenty good enough for Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg Bell had an outstanding game," Robinson said. "That was a slippery, wet, 
treacherous set of circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Bell said the Eagles, a gambling defense by nature, gambled one time too many 
on his long run. He said it was only a matter of time before a big play popped. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew our line was more dominant than theirs because they were trying so many 
stunts," he said. "If a team stunts a lot, it tells you one thing: they can't 
beat you straight, so they've got to try and finesse their way. And they 
weren't capable of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
So, Ram fans live to suffer another day. The Rams dominated the Eagles 
throughout, but still needed a fourth-quarter surge to protect the win. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was almost indignant when asked how such a thing could happen. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the way this team has played all year," he said. "We screw up. That's 
us." 
</P>
<P>
It took the Rams five plays to score on their first possession, Everett 
throwing a wobbly, underthrown pass to receiver Henry Ellard, who was rewarded 
for jumping higher than safety Jenkins by pulling down the reception at about 
the 20 and strolling in for a 39-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
After a 30-yard Eagles' punt on their first possession, the Rams marched 46 
yards in seven plays for another touchdown, the score coming on a four-yard 
pass from Everett to Damone Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams might have been cruising at halftime if not for Bell's fumble inside 
the five; a 47-yard field goal attempt by Mike Lansford that went awry, and an 
Everett interception late in the half after the Rams had earned first-and-10 at 
the Eagles' 25. 
</P>
<P>
The unenlightened might see the squandering of such opportunities as wasteful, 
or nerve-wracking. 
</P>
<P>
"We have character," tackle Irv Pankey said. "We don't put up a facade of 
character, you see what I'm saying? We've got character." 
</P>
<P>
With Sunday's win, the Rams also have a chance, and a funny feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's growing on us," Everett said. "It's like the Rams can get there." 
</P>
<P>
And the Eagles can't. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the quarterback battle, Jim Everett completed 18 of 33 passes for 281 yards 
and two touchdowns; Randall Cunningham was 24 of 40 for 238 yards with no 
touchdowns and one interception. . . . Ram quarterback coach Dick Coury said he 
has had preliminary conversations about coaching vacancies with the Phoenix 
Cardinals and New York Jets. Coury said new Jet General Manager Dick Steinberg 
called him, but no formal interviews have been scheduled. . . . Ram defensive 
coordinator Fritz Shurmur is expected to be among those considered for the 
Cardinals' job. . . . Both sacks of Cunningham were made by linebacker Kevin 
Greene. . . . Add Cunningham: His only punt of the game traveled just 20 yards. 
. . . The Eagles' lone touchdown game on a one-yard run by Anthony Toney in the 
fourth quarter, capping an 11-play, 80-yard drive. . . . The Rams held the 
Eagles to just 95 yards net rushing.

RAMS GOT DEFENSIVE ABOUT IT

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The poor guy was just trying to do his job, revving up a grounds-crew truck 
outside the Ram locker room, and there was John Robinson's red face, screaming 
at him. 
</P>
<P>
"Either move it in or move it out," Robinson yelled at the driver. "We can't 
get anything done with that going." 
</P>
<P>
Upon command, the rumbling truck shifted into reverse and retreated around the 
corner, out of earshot, giving Robinson the space he needed to conduct his 
postgame rap session. 
</P>
<P>
The coach looked pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said, puffing out his chest. "We're tough guys." 
</P>
<P>
If you thought the Rams were defensive during Sunday's 21-7 wild-card victory 
over Philadelphia, you should have heard them in the aftermath. Under Ram horns 
sits some extremely thin skin, along with ears that burned all week, on both 
coasts. 
</P>
<P>
This is what the Rams heard, or what they thought they heard: 
</P>
<P>
(a) They're too soft. 
</P>
<P>
(b) They can't play in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
(c) They can't play in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
(d) They can't play a lick of defense. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson swears he heard it. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always on us -- we don't play enough man-to-man, we don't rush the 
passer, we're stupid, we don't know how to coach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett swears he heard it. 
</P>
<P>
"How many shows did I watch in Philadelphia talking about the Eagles going to 
San Francisco?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Kevin Greene swears he heard it. 
</P>
<P>
"We read stuff about the warm weather, the beach boys from L.A.," he said. "And 
I don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
Basically, it took three Philadelphia quotes to set the Rams off. The first had 
Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan calling the Ram defense the worst in the playoffs. True, 
but unkind. The second also came from Ryan, claiming the Eagles were good 
enough to beat the 49ers, which presumed the Eagles already had the Rams 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
The third came from Mike Schad, the Ram washout who now starts for 
Philadelphia. Schad forecast an Eagle victory because the Rams weren't physical 
enough up front and, basically, were about to get head-butted all over Veterans 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard all of it," Everett said. "We took a lot of pregame abuse. That comes 
with the territory, I guess, when you play Philly and Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave us a lot of motivation. We had the locker-room material. They gave 
it to us. That's the way they play, that's fine. 
</P>
<P>
"They deserved everything they got today." 
</P>
<P>
So Sunday was a day for the Rams to break a few myths, although, as with most 
stereotypes, some of them were grounded in fact. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Before Sunday, the Rams were 2-5 in playoff games this decade. Robinson's 
only postseason victories had come against the Dallas Cowboys -- in 1983 and 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Before Sunday, the Rams were winless in cold-weather playoff sites this 
decade, losing twice at Washington and again at Chicago in the 1985 NFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: The Rams' defense did rank 21st in the NFL this season -- a dead-last 
28th against the pass. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Ram cornerback LeRoy Irvin a fact-checker. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the standings, look at the ratings," Irvin said. "We do have the worst 
defense in the playoffs. No doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
And the worst defense in the playoffs holds Randall Cunningham to seven points. 
</P>
<P>
"Not bad for a bunch of hacks," Irvin noted. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin wasn't, however, as ready to support the cold-war theory. 
</P>
<P>
"They said we couldn't win in the cold? Why?" Irvin said. "Because we lost to 
Chicago when they were the most dominant team in the entire league? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how they can say that. I'm from Kansas, Mel Owens is from 
Michigan, Vince Newsome is from Washington. We've got guys who've played in 
cold weather their entire college careers." 
</P>
<P>
Including running back Greg Bell, late of Notre Dame and the Buffalo Bills, who 
gets downright indignant over the topic. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always writing we have trouble with the cold weather," Bell said. 
"That's nothing new. I've been written off for the last six years. I've been 
out of the league for six years. I'm still reading that I'm a malingerer, 
although I don't see it and John Robinson doesn't see it. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see us blinking in the cold weather today. But that won't change what 
people write about us." 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing the Rams moved as well as they did in the Pennsylvania rain, 
considering the persecution complex they carried with them. 
</P>
<P>
But, whatever gets you through the wild-card round. If Rams had to believe that 
the world was out to get them in order to band together against the Eagles, 
then fine, there may be a future in paranoid power after all. 
</P>
<P>
If Everett found the going a little too slippery when wet -- he was intercepted 
twice -- the Ram defense and offensive line performed at peak capacity. When 
Philadelphia had the football, the Rams yielded but three first downs in the 
first half, sacked Cunningham twice and held the Eagles scoreless through three 
quarters. When the Rams had the ball, the hard-rushing Philadelphia front was 
neutralized, resulting in 409 net Ram yards, sleet or no sleet. 
</P>
<P>
"We physically controlled the football game," said Robinson, delighting in each 
syllable. "Their defensive line is to be congratulated; they're famous. I don't 
want to call it a standoff, but we controlled the line of scrimmage. Their 
defensive line clearly had their hands full." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Everett gleefully pointed out, "We might live close to Hollywood, but we 
still know how to play football." 
</P>
<P>
Ram football. 
</P>
<P>
Ram tough.

STEELERS GIVE OILERS THE BOOT IN OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It began as a comedy of errors, and although both teams played 15 minutes of 
pretty good football in the fourth quarter, it ended with another big error in 
overtime -- a fumble that led the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 26-23 upset victory 
over the Houston Oilers Sunday at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Houston halfback Lorenzo White fumbled a kickoff in the end 
zone before picking the ball up and running it out to the five-yard line. This 
is a mistake that few high school backs make. 
</P>
<P>
In overtime, on the Oilers' first play after the Steelers had won the toss but 
failed to make a first down, White fumbled again. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Pittsburgh got it on the Oiler 46, made one first down, then called 
in Gary Anderson to kick the seventh 50-yard field goal of his career for the 
winning points of the day's second NFL wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
It was his fourth field goal of a ragged, sometimes badly played game that was 
full of dropped passes, mishandled punts, false starts and wasted big plays. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's kicking, however, was errorless, putting the Steelers in Denver for 
next weekend's second-round match with the favored Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
"It can go unsaid that our football team is on the way up," Pittsburgh Coach 
Chuck Noll said afterward. "Playoff time is fun time. That's what you work for 
all year." 
</P>
<P>
Houston Coach Jerry Glanville, who usually has a lot to say, said: "There 
really isn't much to say." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's big kick put Glanville's team away despite a strong comeback 
performance by Oiler quarterback Warren Moon, who took charge in the fourth 
period after Pittsburgh had led after the first 15 minutes, 7-0, at halftime, 
10-6, and after one series of the fourth period, 16-9. 
</P>
<P>
At that point -- after the Oilers had made only one first down in the third 
quarter -- Moon finally got them moving with two impressive drives ending in 
touchdown passes to wide receiver Ernest Givins. 
</P>
<P>
And now, after slumbering most of the afternoon, Houston was ahead, 23-16. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't last. As a crowd of Houston partisans swept the Steelers with noisy 
jeers, they marched 82 yards to get even in regulation time, 23-23, before 
winning it in the fifth minute of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh quarterback Bubby Brister was the triggerman for the Steelers on the 
two touchdown drives they managed in the midst of Anderson's kicking exhibition 
-- an exhibition in which he improved steadily as the day wore on with field 
goals of 25, 30, 48 and 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Brister's poise -- in only his second season as a starter -- was 
eventually the difference. But it was the coaching of Noll that made everything 
possible for the Steelers, who moved to their first touchdown with 
well-rehearsed, old-fashioned plays -- a Statue of Liberty run and a 
quick-pitch end run, both by rookie running back Tim Worley. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening minutes, after the Steelers blocked Houston's first punt at the 
Oiler 32, Noll's first call was the statue, which produced 13 yards. His last 
call was the pitch to Worley for the nine-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, the NFL's better teams often relied on the quick pitch, which 
requires a big, fast back with the moves to cut around the defensive line 
without any help from pulling blockers. 
</P>
<P>
Noll, who has been around awhile, brought it back at the right time and place, 
and Worley made it go as well as Bobby Mitchell used to for Cleveland when 
Browns' opponents were keying on Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The game-tying Pittsburgh touchdown drive in the fourth quarter was another 
Noll masterpiece. At all times, he made sure to keep the pressure off Brister, 
who was asked to throw nothing longer than 10 yards, and who was assisted at a 
timely moment by an end-around run by wide receiver Dwight Stone gaining 22 
yards to the Houston 29. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the Steelers hammered in the tying touchdown on six runs by their 
big backs, Worley and Merril Hoge, through a Houston line that had been 
devastated by injuries. By then, three of the Oilers' most useful defensive 
linemen, Ray Childress, Doug Smith and Richard Byrd, were all out. 
</P>
<P>
Noll's most successful call on that last drive, the one that probably won him 
the game, was Hoge's nine-yard draw play to the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
And so a sharp, old NFL coach, Noll, combined with some sharp new Steelers -- 
Brister, Worley, Hoge and tight end Mike Mularkey, among others, to end another 
dream for Houston Coach Glanville. 
</P>
<P>
To most of the 58,306 watching in the oldest of the domed stadiums, Glanville 
appeared to have brought in the better offensive players -- Moon, Givins, wide 
receiver Drew Hill and four rotating backs, the best of whom is halfback Allen 
Pinkett. 
</P>
<P>
But as an offensive team, the problem with the Oilers is that their running 
offense is based on power and their pass offense on the run-and-shoot. 
</P>
<P>
You can usually tell what they're going to do by the way they line up. When 
their four little receivers are on the field, it's hard for them to fake a pass 
and succeed with a power run. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, they don't effectively pass after faking a run. 
</P>
<P>
Good football teams normally run to set up the pass -- as Washington and even 
San Francisco often do -- or they pass to set up the run, as Detroit does in 
its run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
But the Oilers don't do either. And in the overtime period, after their 
defensive team had stopped Pittsburgh at the outset, Glanville had to make a 
decision: Should he send in the pass-offense race horses or the power backs? 
</P>
<P>
After thinking it over a moment, he called for the power. But on first down, he 
gave the ball to White, an East-West runner with some moves who often fails to 
cut forward at the appropriate time. 
</P>
<P>
On the biggest play of the game, he was still sliding laterally when cornerback 
Rod Woodson came up and separated him from the ball. 
</P>
<P>
When White fumbled, the New Year's party was almost over for the Oilers. On 
Pittsburgh's first play after recovering the fumble, Noll went back to his 
trap-blocking offense -- he is one of the few favoring this style of attack as 
an everyday staple -- and got 11 yards from Hoge. 
</P>
<P>
That was enough for Anderson.

Boulder, Colo., schoolteachers Bill and Cheryl Dennler say they have learned 
their lesson. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 4, Bill Dennler watched elated fans topple the goal post at Folsom 
Field in Boulder after Colorado beat Nebraska, in effect assuring the Buffaloes 
of a trip to the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Dennlers took out a second mortgage on their home to finance sales of 
slices of the goal post, mounted on a wooden base with the CU logo, for $59.95. 
They obtained the goal post from the university, which is to receive 10% of any 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
But there apparently won't be any. 
</P>
<P>
The Dennlers' family room is stacked with about 400 plaques. "We've only sold 
about 50 of them," Cheryl Dennler said. "We've learned a lot about marketing. 
We've learned that we're not salespeople. We'll never do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Rookie Tony Mandarich of the Green Bay Packers, the first 
offensive lineman taken in the NFL draft, did not start a game this season. Who 
was the last offensive lineman to be chosen first and not start a game during 
his rookie season? 
</P>
<P>
Part of a tradition: Carmen Cozza, Yale's football coach, recalled being an 
assistant at Miami of Ohio in 1963 when head coach John Pont left for Yale. 
Cozza was beaten out for the Miami job by another assistant, Bo Schembechler, 
who will coach his final game for Michigan today. Cozza, a Cleveland native, 
took over at Yale when Pont became coach at Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Any regrets after 25 years at Yale? Cozza told Joe Concannon of the Boston 
Globe: "I came from a country school to a school surrounded by a city. It was a 
different experience. I didn't realize the beauty of this place until I started 
walking through the courtyards, and I realized football as we know it today 
really started here. I've never wanted to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Grass is greener: Alan Page, Hall of Fame defensive end for the Minnesota 
Vikings and Chicago Bears, on playing on artificial turf: "I suppose you could 
say it was novel, at the beginning. But at the time, I was playing on good 
fields and ice fields and fields with no grass on them. This was another 
variation for the list. But it was at the bottom of the list." 
</P>
<P>
A sore winner: Lee Remmel, the Green Bay Packers' publicity director, on being 
a reporter during Coach Vince Lombardi's era: "When he was winning, (Lombardi) 
was very arrogant answering questions. When he lost, he had a certain amount of 
humility and was easy to talk to. But then Vince never had a losing season." 
</P>
<P>
Living the concept: Former Raider linebacker Matt Millen has a chance for a 
third Super Bowl ring, this time as a San Francisco 49er. Millen on his former 
team: "When you would watch them the last few years, you'd look at No. 55 and 
say, 'That's what a Raider is.' Am I wrong or right? I epitomized it." 
</P>
<P>
Letter head: Reliever Mark Davis, on being reunited with former Padre teammate 
Storm Davis on the Kansas City Royals' staff: "My back was getting to feel a 
little light without the 'M' on my uniform."

AFTER YEARS OF WINNING, HATFIELD WORRIED ABOUT THE WORDING; 
</P>
<P>
COTTON BOWL: ARKANSAS COACH FUSSING OVER CONTRACT BEFORE FACING TENNESSEE IN 
SECOND CONSECUTIVE TRIP TO DALLAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In six seasons as head football coach at the University of Arkansas, his alma 
mater, Ken Hatfield has compiled a record of 55-16-1, the best winning 
percentage (.771) of any coach in school history. What's more, he has survived 
the '80s without the taint of NCAA probation, which, given the state of the 
Southwest Conference during the last decade, is practically a Man Bites Dog 
story. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Holtz, Hatfield's predecessor at Arkansas, took the Razorbacks to six 
different bowl games during his seven years at the school, but never got them 
to the Cotton Bowl. Today, under Hatfield, the 10th-ranked Razorbacks (10-1) 
will make their second consecutive Cotton Bowl appearance, meeting 
eighth-ranked Tennessee (10-1). The game marks the first time Arkansas has 
appeared in back-to-back Cotton Bowls since 1965-66. 
</P>
<P>
But, even with these accomplishments, Hatfield doesn't rest easy, and a new 
contract, offered to him a year ago, remains on his desk in Fayetteville, Ark., 
unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a couple of little wording things in there that I don't think are 
right," he said, "and I'm not going to sign it as long as they're wrong. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . It's a difference of opinion. At this point, we have not resolved it. 
But I love Arkansas. It's my state. We've won there. We're recruiting well 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But will they love him tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
When Hatfield replaced Holtz, ousted after a 6-5 season, the move was hailed as 
a native son returning to his roots. Hatfield, coming off a five-year run as 
head coach at Air Force, had grown up in Helena, Ark., and played defensive 
back for the Razorbacks. His 81-yard punt return for a touchdown helped 
Arkansas beat Texas, 14-13, in 1964, the year the Razorbacks went 11-0 and won 
the national championship. Razorback fans, weary of Holtz's jokes and excuses, 
were ready for the change. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long, however, before the school's fickle following turned on 
Hatfield. His offense, a wishbone derivative known as the flexbone, was roundly 
knocked for being unimaginative and boring. Hatfield's personal style also drew 
criticism. He was said to be too preachy, too open with his religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-Hatfield sentiment reached a crescendo in 1987 when the Razorbacks, 
picked to win the SWC, finished tied for second. And as that season wound down, 
Arkansas Athletic Director Frank Broyles, the man who had coached Hatfield and 
then hired him 19 years later, joined the chorus, saying publicly that Hatfield 
needed to open up personally -- be more willing to explain his actions to 
Arkansas fans -- and open up his offense as well. 
</P>
<P>
Under these pressurized conditions, the Razorbacks won the '88 SWC championship 
outright and earned the school's first Cotton Bowl trip in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of that season, Hatfield was offered a new contract, but he declined 
to sign it. There was speculation before Arkansas' Cotton Bowl meeting with 
UCLA that Hatfield was headed for Georgia to replace the retiring Vince Dooley. 
Hatfield did not dispel that speculation, then later said the talk linking him 
to the job was enough of a distraction to contribute to his team's 17-3 loss to 
the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Said Broyles: "As a reward for a great ('88) season, he got a new five-year 
contract, a big raise and raises for his coaches. I did that way before the 
Cotton Bowl. Then he looks at it, and he wants a big . . . Well, his lawyer 
wants a big definitive contract rather than just what faculty and Holtz and 
(former Arkansas basketball Coach Eddie) Sutton and Broyles and others had. So 
we write up a big definitive contract for him." 
</P>
<P>
Definitive? "Meaning everything a lawyer can think of," Broyles said. "Thirteen 
pages." 
</P>
<P>
Broyles says he is "totally confident" with Hatfield in charge of the football 
program, although they are not close personally. 
</P>
<P>
Said Broyles: "We have nothing in common off the field, because he does certain 
things like . . . Well, I play golf. He plays tennis and other things. When I'm 
not at the office or at home, I'm playing golf. But I don't think I would want 
to be personal friends with the people who work under me, as a rule. I just 
don't think that's wise. But Ken and I are professional friends." 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield on Broyles: "My relationship with him is something that's been 
different ever since I've been back at the University of Arkansas. But, hey, 
he's doing a good job. As an athletic director, he's doing a tremendous job." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's plain that these two are on different pages philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
According to Broyles, a college football coach nowadays has to do more than 
simply win. He must win with the sort of flair that will keep the stadium full 
and the contributions flowing. 
</P>
<P>
Said Broyles: "The day Lou Holtz walked in, I said, 'You've got to sell out the 
stadium, do whatever it takes to sell out the stadium.' And he did. He knew 
that. I think any coach knows that." 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield may know it, but he doesn't buy into it. He did dump his flexbone this 
season in favor of the I-formation. But Hatfield remains a ground-oriented 
coach. The Razorbacks actually threw the ball less in '89 than they did in '88. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield on offense: "Too many of the commentators doing football on television 
are pro-oriented or come from the pro ranks. They think you've got to throw the 
ball every down. . . . The game is changing a little bit, but the media people 
have made it like if you don't pass, you're no good. A fullback who carries the 
ball is not thought of as highly as a receiver who makes a splashy, spectacular 
catch. And yet I love that fullback who's got a momma and daddy just like 
everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
So, what does Ken Hatfield want? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know yet," he said. "I mean, I know what I want, but that's something 
that the administration, myself and so forth are going to have to talk about 
after Jan. 1."

NEBRASKA'S GDOWSKI IMPRESSES THE PEOPLE WHO COUNT THE MOST; 
</P>
<P>
FIESTA BOWL: CORNHUSKER QUARTERBACK, THE COACHES' CHOICE, LEADS TEAM AGAINST 
FLORIDA STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

TEMPE, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike Florida State's Peter Tom Willis, his lankier counterpart in today's 
Fiesta Bowl game, Nebraska quarterback Gerry Gdowski probably won't attract 
much attention from NFL scouts. 
</P>
<P>
A year from now, the 6-foot, 190-pound Academic All-American might well be back 
home in Fremont, Neb., balancing books as an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
Like Willis, though, Gdowski will look back fondly on a senior season in which 
he was nothing short of spectacular in his only chance to be a collegiate 
starter, putting up the kind of numbers that made fans and the media wonder 
where he had been hiding for three years. 
</P>
<P>
According to his coach, Tom Osborne, no Nebraska quarterback has ever played 
the position any better than Gdowski. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, he remains almost as unknown as he was last August. 
</P>
<P>
An understudy for two years behind All-Big Eight quarterback Steve Taylor, a 
three-year starter for the Cornhuskers, Gdowski emerged from Taylor's shadow 
only to be eclipsed this season by Colorado's spectacular Darian Hagan, who led 
the Buffaloes to the Big Eight championship, an unbeaten regular season, an 
Orange Bowl date against Notre Dame and the top of the polls. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came time for the Big Eight coaches to select an all-conference 
quarterback, the name they chose was Gerry Gdowski. 
</P>
<P>
The media chose Hagan. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the coaches found these numbers hard to ignore: 
</P>
<P>
 -- While Hagan passed for 1,002 yards and ran for 1,004 to become only the 
fifth player in major college history to both pass and run for more than 1,000 
yards in the same season, Gdowski passed for 1,326 and ran for 925 in 69 fewer 
attempts than Hagan, averaging 7.9 yards a carry to Hagan's 5.4. 
</P>
<P>
"When you figure that he's going to run some quarterback sneaks and he's going 
to get sacked a few times, it's really remarkable for a quarterback to average 
(almost) eight yards a carry," Osborne said. "I'd say that's probably the most 
significant of his statistics." 
</P>
<P>
It is not, however, the only one that stands out. 
</P>
<P>
Some others: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gdowski averaged 204.6 total yards a game, which was superior to Hagan's 
average of 182.4 and established a Cornhusker record.

<P>
 -- While Hagan accounted for 21 touchdowns, including 17 by rushing, Gdowski 
accounted for 32 total and 19 through the air, one every seven pass attempts 
and only one short of Vince Ferragamo's school record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gdowski threw only two interceptions in 136 pass attempts, none in his last 
92, and accumulated a passing efficiency rating of 177.3, which would have 
surpassed Jim McMahon's NCAA record of 176.9 if Gdowski had attempted the 
required 15 passes a game instead of only 12.4. 
</P>
<P>
"Amazing," Kansas Coach Glen Mason said of the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, outside his football-crazed home state and the projection rooms of 
Cornhusker opponents, Gdowski is widely unrecognized. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the reason for that, it seems, is that despite a 10-1 record and No. 6 
national ranking, the Cornhuskers were under-publicized this season, especially 
for a team that earned its 21st straight bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
None of Nebraska's powder-puff nonconference schedule, which included games 
against Northern Illinois, Utah, Minnesota and Oregon State, was televised by 
the networks or ESPN. Neither were the Cornhuskers' Big Eight games against 
Oklahoma and Oklahoma State because those teams, sanctioned by the NCAA, 
couldn't appear on television this season. 
</P>
<P>
And Nebraska hardly made the most of its only national TV appearance, losing to 
Colorado in a showdown for the Big Eight title. 
</P>
<P>
But even that doesn't explain Gdowski's lack of recognition. 
</P>
<P>
While Hagan passed for only 22 yards and ran for 86 and a touchdown, accounting 
for 108 total yards in Colorado's 27-21 victory over the Cornhuskers, Gdowski 
ran for 69 yards in 14 fewer carries and passed for 211 yards and three 
touchdowns, accounting for 280 total yards against a defense that allowed only 
300 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
It's understandable, then, that when asked what he hoped to get out of today's 
game, Gdowski said: "I guess maybe a little respect." 
</P>
<P>
Though he averaged 8.2 yards a carry in 35 rushing attempts as a sophomore and 
junior, Gdowski gave little indication of his passing prowess, throwing for 
only 72 yards in two seasons after connecting on only 32.6% of his attempts 
three years ago as a starter on the freshman team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had probably a better year than I could have imagined," said Gdowski, who 
would have a year of eligibility remaining if he had redshirted as a sophomore 
instead of spending the season third on the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, even Gdowski didn't anticipate his emergence. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to be the third-team quarterback and I was going to have a chance 
to play a little bit and travel with the team," he said of his decision not to 
redshirt. "Plus, I knew I could graduate in four years. I thought it would be 
better just to get on with things. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could have looked into the future and known I was going to have a year 
like this, I would have liked to redshirt. But I'm happy with the way things 
turned out. I don't regret anything."

No. 9 Auburn, which finished the regular season with a five-game winning 
streak, faces No. 21 Ohio State, which won six of seven games after a 2-2 
start, today for the first time since 1917 in the Hall of Fame Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (9-2) are eight-point favorites over the Buckeyes (8-3), but Auburn 
Coach Pat Dye is wary of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an underdog has been a motivating factor for them every day for a 
month," said Dye. 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeyes, playing in a bowl game for the first time in three years, led the 
Big Ten in offense and scoring, utilizing the kind of balanced attack that gave 
Auburn problems in a midseason loss to Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State Coach John Cooper is concerned about Auburn's defense, which held 
opponents to 268.7 yards and 10.6 points and will counter the Buckeyes' size 
(Ohio State's offensive line averages 295 pounds) with quickness. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been telling us how hard it's going to be moving the ball against 
Auburn, and you can see that on the films," said Ohio State quarterback Greg 
Frey, whose improved play was instrumental in the Buckeyes' turnaround from a 
4-6-1 finish in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't really tell until you get out there, though," Frey said. "I don't go 
into a game worrying about whether we're going to run the ball or throw it. All 
I want to do is win. We'll just do what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeyes would prefer to run, allowing Carlos Snow and Scottie Graham to 
pound away at the defense and control the clock. Snow rushed for 948 yards 
despite a nagging knee problem and Graham gained 924 yards, but Frey has been 
effective enough throwing that opponents can't take the passing game for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
The junior quarterback led the Big Ten in passing efficiency and finished with 
128 completions in 215 attempts for 1,900 yards and 12 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
There have been times this season when Ohio State's best defense has been its 
offense. The Buckeyes gave up 386.7 yards and 24.2 points, but overcame it by 
averaging 418.1 yards and 29.5 points on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State's 28-18 loss to Michigan in the last game stopped a six-game winning 
streak, but the Buckeyes weren't any hotter than Auburn down the stretch. The 
Tigers looked average in building a 4-2 record but gained momentum in the weeks 
leading up to a 30-20 victory over Alabama on Dec. 2.

Scott Geyer's 85-yard interception return helped Arizona close out the decade 
with a 17-10 victory over North Carolina State Sunday night in the inaugural 
Copper Bowl, college football's newest postseason game. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams dominated on defense and North Carolina State (7-5) held Arizona 
(8-4) to only 50 rushing yards and just 130 total yards, the worst in both 
categories for the Wildcats this season. The Wolfpack gained 222 yards passing 
and 88 rushing and had the ball almost 16 minutes longer than Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
But the Wildcat defense recovered two fumbles, made two interceptions and 
survived three fourth-quarter drives by the Wolfpack that could have tied the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of only 37,237 watched the game, about 20,000 under capacity at Arizona 
Stadium, the Wildcats' home field. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona led, 17-7, at halftime on a 37-yard pass from Ronald Veal to Olatide 
Ogunfiditimi, Geyer's second interception of the game for the touchdown and 
Gary Coston's 34-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Montgomery threw a four-yard pass to Todd Varn with 1:55 left in the half 
for North Carolina State's only touchdown. The Wolfpack also scored on Damon 
Hartman's 43-yard field-goal with 4:53 left in the third quarter, ending a 
10-play, 62-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats forced turnovers that cut off three Wolfpack drives and came up 
with the key plays when needed. Chris Singleton forced a punt with a 13-yard 
sack and Ty Parten prevented Aubrey Shaw from converting a fourth-and-one at 
the Arizona 26 with 3:03 to go. 
</P>
<P>
After Arizona punted, the Wolfpack's last chance ended when Chris Williams 
dropped a pass from Montgomery deep in Arizona territory with 57 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays after a Wolfpack punt, Veal passed to Ogunfiditimi to start the 
scoring with 1:59 left in the first quarter. It was only the third touchdown 
pass of the season for Veal. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the second period, with the Wolfpack at Arizona's 17 and driving 
after Jesse Campbell intercepted a Veal pass at the Wildcat 29, Geyer stepped 
in front of a pass by Montgomery intended for Varn and easily raced 85 yards to 
make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery's short pass to Varn brought North Carolina State within a 
touchdown, but Arizona drove from its 36 to the Wolfpack 24 after the ensuing 
kickoff and Coston kicked his field goal 10 seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's worst previous rushing total this season was 97 yards against Texas 
Tech and the Wildcats had only 161 yards against Oregon. They lost both games.

Ed Chynoweth, the president of the Western Hockey League, stepped in and 
persuaded members of the Tri-Cities Americans that they should play their 
scheduled game against the Portland Winter Hawks at Portland Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The night before, the Americans and Winter Hawks were scheduled to play in in 
Kennewick, Wash., but that game was canceled after 20 members of the Americans 
refused to play. 
</P>
<P>
The revolt was aimed at Bill LaForge, the team's new director of hockey 
operations. The players want him fired. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the players said Saturday that they disliked LaForge's approach 
and would not play until he is gone. 
</P>
<P>
Chynoweth said a compromise was reached Sunday. He didn't say what it was, but 
added: "What I pointed out to them, very simply, was that if they weren't 
prepared to play, then I had no choice but to look at possible suspensions and 
the possible loss of scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's a threat. I think that's a fact of life." 
</P>
<P>
LaForge, hired Dec. 17, has taken on the duties of co-coach with Rick Kozuback, 
who has been head coach since the hockey season began. The Americans began the 
season as a favorite to win the WHL's Western Division but have fallen into 
third place at 16-16-3.

TWO BIG WINS GIVE JETS CONFIDENCE

The Winnipeg Jets enter the new year with a lot of confidence after victories 
over two of their Smythe Division rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Smail scored the winning goal at 9:32 of the third period Sunday at 
Winnipeg as the Jets followed an 2-1 overtime victory over the Calgary Flames 
two nights earlier with a 3-2 win over the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big win for us in Calgary and it would have been a shame to come back 
here and lose to another team that we're chasing," said defenseman Dave Ellett, 
who scored in the second period. "It was a big confidence builder." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Hawerchuk also scored for the Jets, who won their third straight to climb 
to within three points of the third-place Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton was outshot, 31-27, and showed the effects of having to play two games 
in less than 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers beat Montreal, 6-2, just 18 hours earlier in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 5, New York Rangers 4 -- Mario Lemieux and Mark Recchi scored 20 
seconds apart late in the third period at Madison Square Garden to extend the 
Rangers' winless streak to 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux tied the game at 14:10 with a 10-foot wrist shot past Bob Froese. 
Recchi tapped in Dan Quinn's pass at 14:30, extending the Rangers' winless 
skein to 0-8-3, their longest since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins capitalized on a Ranger mistake for the tying goal. New York 
failed to place a man in the penalty box when Kris King received a major for 
slashing at 8:42. The Rangers were unable to get a stoppage of play after the 
penalty expired and were still a skater short when Lemieux scored. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 4, Buffalo 2 -- Pat LaFontaine scored three times, extending 
his goal-scoring streak to seven games, to lead the Islanders at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
LaFontaine, who took over the league lead with 33 goals, has 12 goals in his 
last seven games, during which the Islanders are 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 6, New Jersey 4 -- Rick Zombo, Marc Habscheid and Lee Norwood had goals 
during a 2:19 span as the Red Wings scored five times in the third period at 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit, which was 1-19-2 when trailing after two periods, scored four goals 
within a 7 1/2-minute span early in the third period to overcome a pair of 
two-goal deficits and snap a four-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 2, St. Louis 1 -- Dave Gagner stole the puck from Rob Brind'Amour and 
beat goaltender Vincent Riendeau 1:14 into overtime at Bloomington, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars, who were 2-11-2 in December, snapped winless streaks of six 
games overall and five at home. Since it had the NHL's best record (15-8-1) on 
Nov. 24, Minnesota is 3-12-2. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull of the Blues sent the game into overtime with 8:21 left in 
regulation with his 33rd goal. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 2, Vancouver 2 -- The tie at Vancouver gave the Flyers sole 
possession of first place in the Patrick Division, one point ahead of New 
Jersey and Washington.

RULE CHANGE MAY HAVE OFFICIALS USING ERASER ON RECORD BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An obscure but potentially significant ruling has recently been enacted that 
may change the face, and certainly the record books, of American road racing. 
</P>
<P>
At the recent convention of The Athletics Congress, which governs track and 
field and road racing, a rule was passed which makes times run in 
point-to-point races ineligible for record consideration. The rule also 
modified the allowance made for downhill portions of races. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, times run on point-to-point courses would be considered "records," 
but only for that type of course, and would have little meaning. Times set on 
courses falling outside the new guidelines will now be labeled "noteworthy 
performances." Further, the rules will be applied retroactively to all existing 
distance racing records. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that last part. But first, a bit of background. 
</P>
<P>
There are basically three kinds of course configurations for distance races: 
</P>
<P>
Point-to-point -- Runners start at point A and finish at point B. 
</P>
<P>
Loop -- Runners start at point A and go in a loop to finish back at point A. 
</P>
<P>
Out-and-back -- Runners start at point A, go to a halfway point, and return on 
the same course to finish back at point A. 
</P>
<P>
There has long been discussion in the running community on which course is best 
and most fair. Each has its merit, but the out-and-back course is considered 
most fair. A point-to-point course may be designed so that runners may never 
face a prevailing head wind, for example. A loop course may be designed to 
skirt a horrible hill. On an out-and-back course the runner experiences the 
best and worst of every factor. The tail wind on the first leg will be in his 
face coming back. The downhill on which he could coast on the way out turns 
into a grinding uphill on the way back. 
</P>
<P>
Course variations have also made it difficult to compare relative times. All of 
this has led to years of debate in the road racing community both domestically 
and abroad, culminating in the passage of the TAC rule. 
</P>
<P>
So what? So, consider that America's biggest marathons, Boston, New York and 
Chicago, are all point-to-point races. Also consider that Alberto Salazar's 
American marathon record for men was set at Boston. Joan Benoit Samuelson's 
record for women was set at Chicago (which may sneak in because of an rule 
change that liberalized the allowable distance from the start to the finish 
line). Also consider that Mark Nenow's 10K American record at Crescent City 
fails the start/finish test. 
</P>
<P>
And, while the rule does not apply to world records, the international impact 
is the same. Especially since Americans do compete internationally. The women's 
world record was set at London, a point-to-point course. The Seoul Olympic 
Marathon was point-to-point. The course for the 1994 Barcelona Olympic marathon 
is point-to-point and with elevation variations that may not make it eligible 
for record consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The impact this rule will have on American marathons is tremendous. According 
to records compiled by the Road Race Management newsletter, under this new rule 
the top 17 all-time performances for U.S. men are ineligible for record 
consideration. That appears to make the American record-holder at the marathon 
Tony Sandoval, with a 2:10:20 set Sept. 9, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of changing start/finish lines after decades of tradition may have 
race directors in a snit. The Boston Marathon is actually the Hopkinton, Mass., 
to Boston Marathon. The New York City Marathon's entire cachet is the fact that 
the race starts on Staten Island and weaves through all five boroughs. 
Tradition and logistics are not the only issues. Television loves the New 
England-in-spring look of the early stages of the Boston race and the ethnic 
neighborhoods of the New York course. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the start/finish problem, Boston also fails the elevation 
requirement. Despite its well-known landmark, Heartbreak Hill, Boston is 
basically a downhill race. The new rule allows for an elevation decrease of 10 
feet per mile. Boston has a net decrease of 14 feet per mile. In fact, 
according to Basil Honikman of TAC, Boston's dramatic drop in elevation has the 
effect of making it 500 yards short. 
</P>
<P>
This may account for the fact that, up to the end of 1988, six of the 10 
fastest times ever run by an American were at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Marathon is well within the tolerance levels of the new rule. 
L.A. is and always has been a loop course. It is and shall remain a flat 
course. The elevation change for the race is one foot per mile, barely 
noticeable. The total change is 187 feet, as compared to Boston's drop of some 
450 feet. 
</P>
<P>
This rule change may serve to boost L.A.'s attraction to elite American 
runners, who may not want to waste a world-class effort on a course in which 
they can't get a record. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the rule will have a profound effect on the sport. However, not all 
change is bad. Times on the roads have long been properly called world bests, 
not world records, and for a reason. Unlike races on tracks, road race course 
have had little uniformity or even a modest adherence to worldwide standards. 
Only by factoring in such elements as elevation, wind and even the layout of a 
course can uniform standards begin to be applied to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
This difficult decision by TAC is merely the wave of the future and can only 
help lead to the eventual ratification of road race "records" as accepted world 
records. While internationally some racing officials are dragging their feet on 
adopting TAC's rule in their own federations, look for this idea to slowly gain 
worldwide acceptance.

Former marathoner Dick Beardsley, whose 2:08:54 is second all-time among U.S. 
men, is struggling to recover from an injury that mangled his leg and left him 
with a goal of walking again, much less running. 
</P>
<P>
Beardsley, who lives in rural Minnesota, suffered the injury in a farm accident 
Nov. 13. He was transferring corn to a crib on his farm near Shafer when his 
coveralls became caught in a tractor power takeoff, a drive shaft used to power 
farm implements. He suffered a broken right wrist, broken ribs, cuts on his 
calf muscles in his left leg and severe ligament damage to the left knee before 
he was able to turn off the machine. 
</P>
<P>
Although the accident was horrible, Beardsley had been working with a physical 
therapist three times a week at his farm and his recuperation from the surgery 
had been progressing well. 
</P>
<P>
Then disaster struck again. Last month Beardsley, 33, developed a severe 
postoperative infection in the site of the original surgery and was admitted to 
a hospital after developing a fever. Beardsley's agent, Bill Wenmark, said the 
infection had not invaded the knee joint or gotten into Beardsley's blood 
system, which was good news. 
</P>
<P>
The road ahead is long, however. The second surgery sets his rehabilitation 
back several months. It may take Beardsley years to get out from under the 
medical bills. He had no health insurance at the time of the accident. 
</P>

Running Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Marathon has added a 5K race, to start a half hour after the 
marathon runners. Like the marathoners, the 5K runners will finish in the 
Coliseum. The March 4 race will get substantially more television coverage than 
last year. KCOP Channel 13 has increased its total coverage to 8 1/2 hours, 
with a half-hour preview show the night before the race, five hours of race 
coverage and a three-hour highlight show. Last year's coverage was a total of 5 
1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Marathon's annual series of clinics begins Jan. 9. Race director 
Joe Carlson will outline the program for the weeks leading up to the race. The 
clinics are conducted in cooperation with the Long Beach Parks and Recreation 
Department and will be held at Recreation Park Community Center at 7:30 p.m. 
Information: (213) 494-2664. . . . The Redondo Beach Super Bowl Sunday 10K is 
going strong in its 12th year. The Jan. 28 race usually draws a large field, 
this year about 15,000 runners are expected. In addition to the 10K race, there 
is a companion 5K walk, which is in its second year.

FUTURE: HIGH HOUSING COSTS MAY SEND WORKERS SOUTH OF THE BORDER IN SEARCH OF 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE NEW DECADE.

<P>
People are lined up on the freeway, trying to get to work from San Diego's most 
popular new suburb -- Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
It's 7:15 a.m. In 45 minutes, you and thousands of others will have beaten the 
morning rush -- you hope -- only to sit at your desk for eight hours before 
returning to the San Diego/Tijuana/drive-time fray. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario is more likely than you might imagine. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands may work in "America's Finest City" but they won't be able to live 
here. Those who cannot afford California may look in desperation to Baja 
California, or points many miles east of here. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to San Diego in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The place where the population will continue to boom; where the Hispanic and 
Asian communities will gain increasing prominence; where the work force will 
undergo sweeping changes. It's the place with more traffic, more smog, and a 
vexing need to resolve such problems as what to do with the airport and how to 
build more jails. 
</P>
<P>
With a population expected to reach nearly 2.8 million in the year 2000, 
growing 16% from today's 2.4 million, San Diego County will continue its 
urbanization curve through the 1990s, demographers predict. 
</P>
<P>
Even more stunning growth is expected in the San Diego Unified School District. 
From 1986 to the turn of the century, the number of students is expected to 
increase 46% to 165,000. The largest increase is expected to be in the 
high-school population. 
</P>
<P>
But planners say those increasing numbers of people will be increasingly 
squeezed for places to live -- leading to higher prices, vanishing open space 
and the emergence of new suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Max Schetter, director for the Economic Research Bureau of the Greater San 
Diego Chamber of Commerce, said the county growth will produce surprising 
shifts and turns, not the least of which is the "Tijuana factor," in which not 
only do Mexicans continue to migrate to the United States to find jobs, but 
U.S. residents move in the other direction, with affordable housing in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The poor and lower-middle class might settle in Mexico only because the average 
price of a San Diego home may be prohibitive by the year 2000, outstripping 
gains in income. 
</P>
<P>
The average household income is expected to rise 90% during the decade, to 
$92,400. But the average home price is expected to rise by 124%, to $439,500. 
</P>
<P>
"The huge numbers of Hispanics and Asians coming into the county will work in 
San Diego but may live in Mexico," Schetter said. "As housing becomes less 
affordable, they'll have to consider Tijuana, or points considerably east of 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"People will want to work here but can't afford to live here. It could affect 
all ethnic groups of the lower middle class (including non-Hispanic whites)." 
</P>
<P>
As workers line up at the border, creating massive traffic jams in an effort to 
get to work, Schetter predicts, the county will need new border crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Schetter and other experts say that, 
</P>
<P>
except for the upper class, those who wish to move within the county -- "to 
trade up" -- will be severely limited in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will have massive equity in their homes, but it won't do them much 
good unless they move to another region, because all the other houses in San 
Diego County will have gone up just as much. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the demand for housing, during the 14 years from 1986 to 2000, 
the number of housing units is expected to increase by 37%, to more than 1 
million. Vacant land is expected to undergo a corresponding shrinkage of 
100,000 acres, a loss of about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Makeup 
</P>
<P>
Given the press that the increasing Hispanic population has received, it is not 
surprising to most San Diegans that continuing migration and high birth rates 
will mean that the number of Hispanics in the county will more than double, to 
700,000, from 1980 to the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
But what confounds even some demographers is that the Asian population will 
more than triple during that time, to 356,600. The change was not foreseen 
until recently. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Madsen, a sociologist at UC San Diego and contributor to the book, 
"Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life," said the 
Asian explosion makes perfect sense when considering its sources: Hong Kong, 
Indochina and other cities in California. 
</P>
<P>
Control of Hong Kong reverts from the British to the Chinese in 1997, so Madsen 
believes refugees will leave Hong Kong -- San Diego being only one destination 
-- over a gradual 7-year period. He believes the evacuation of Indochinese from 
Cambodia and Vietnam has by no means ceased. He sees greater numbers of 
Japanese and Koreans arriving in San Diego because of its promise of 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"You have as many as 50,000 people a year leaving Hong Kong now," he said. 
"Plus, the Hong Kong government recently turned away thousands of Indochinese 
refugees. They had to return to Vietnam. Sooner or later, some of those will 
come here." 
</P>
<P>
Madsen sees the West Coast as becoming "much more multiethnic in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"Every generation has had its share of immigrants, but clearly the most visible 
immigrants in this generation will be Asians and Hispanics. It presents certain 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"America has long been dominated by European values. The mentality has been 
WASPish or European, and that may change. Americans have tended to be more open 
than some societies, but on the other hand, this nasty streak of racism seems 
to be coming back. I thought racism had waned after the civil rights movement, 
but that isn't the case at all." 
</P>
<P>
The non-Hispanic white population -- in 1988, 67% of the county's residents -- 
is expected to fall to 58.5% by the year 2000. The county's black population is 
expected to stay about the same, at nearly 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the San Diego Police Department nor the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department keep statistics on so-called hate crimes, except to say that they 
rose significantly in the 1980s. Madsen fears the county's clash of cultures 
may ignite more in the future. 
</P>
<P>
He noted, for instance, that the number of Asians entering the state's elite 
University of California system increased dramatically during the 1980s, with 
the trend expected to flex itself more strongly during the next decade. As 
minorities win out in academic and professional challenges, "it's not hard to 
see," he said, why tensions will be inflamed. 
</P>
<P>
Age 
</P>
<P>
The aging baby boomers will play a major role in making San Diego an older 
county in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the median age was 28.8 years; by the year 2000, it is projected to be 
35.8 -- just about middle age. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Tayman, senior planner with the San Diego Assn. of Governments (SANDAG), 
said that change will affect the make-up of families, putting older parents at 
home with their children. "The baby boomers are having kids a lot later," he 
said. "We'll have a lot more parents, 50 and 60 years old, with kids home. It's 
kind of terrifying when you think about it. We expect to see a tremendous 
increase in high school students in the Nineties." 
</P>
<P>
Madsen, the sociologist, said older parents may be a change for the better. 
</P>
<P>
"Such parents will probably be more mature, more comfortable materially and 
thus better able to take care of children," he said. "I see it as a plus. They 
may feel more sympathetic to paying for education, as much as they do, say, for 
health care." 
</P>
<P>
But those older parents are expected to face double burdens -- caring for their 
own parents at the same time that they care for their children. 
</P>
<P>
As life expectancy increases, the number of double-generation elderly is 
expected to increase -- "younger" senior citizens in their 60s, for example, 
caring for parents who are in their 80s. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see a significant increase in the elderly," Tayman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employment 
</P>
<P>
Tayman predicts dramatic changes in the county's work force. He said that more 
than half the new workers will be female, and more than 60% of new workers will 
be minorities. He said that only 15% of new workers will be white, non-Hispanic 
males. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the increasing entry of women into the workplace, he foresees child 
care becoming perhaps the most major employment issue of the 1990s. In 
addition, the new ethnic makeup will make affirmative action a major issue of 
the new decade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to see a lot of discrimination suits." 
</P>
<P>
Those workers are expected to go to jobs increasingly centered in the high-tech 
arena and focused more and more away from the military. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies of employment trends predict the number of direct military jobs 
staying the same in the county through the year 2000. But Schetter said those 
figures might have been outdated by a combination of glasnost and the federal 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a trend that's been growing for a long time," he said. "At the end of 
World War II, 70% of all county jobs were oriented to the military. Now, the 
figure is somewhere near 20%." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the number of military workers remains the same, it will be dwarfed by 
expected increases in other fields. For example, the number of retail service 
employees will increase from 1986 to the turn of the century from 141,069 to 
203,307. Manufacturing, which employed 127,893 people in 1986, is expected to 
provide jobs for 200,000 by the end of the new decade. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the county's work force is expected to increase during that time by 
50% and almost 500,000 jobs -- none of those in the armed services. 
</P>
<P>
And very little of that increase -- 139, to be exact -- is expected to fall in 
the agricultural category, a sign of increasing urbanization in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Schetter said the county is becoming more high-tech, more white-collar, more 
business-oriented and much less dependent on the military. 
</P>
<P>
No sleepy little Navy town any more; no rural backwater in the shadow of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transportation 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic increase in the number of workers also puts pressure on the county 
to find a way of getting those people to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the growth of the work force, the increase in traffic will be much 
greater than the growth of the population," Tayman said. 
</P>
<P>
Tayman said San Diego's "drive-alone" compulsion has to cease, or the rush-hour 
commute will be "horrendous," on the order, say, of Houston or Los Angeles. He 
said the current average of 1.1 San Diegans commuting to work each day by car 
must increase to 1.5 or 1.7 by the end of the decade to avoid disastrous 
traffic snarls. As a result, Tayman said car-pooling may evolve from the realm 
of "polite suggestion" to a legislative mandate born of necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Tuomi, SANDAG's transportation expert, said San Diego County has 56% more 
traffic today than it did nine years ago. He said new freeways, extensions of 
old ones, an expanded trolley line and a commuter rail system through North 
County will ease the traffic burden, but the key is boosting the passenger load 
per car. 
</P>
<P>
Tuomi said that 55 million people ride the county's trolley or bus lines each 
year; the number "needs to reach" 95 million by 1995. In the 1990s, the 
trolley's eastern end, now in El Cajon, will stretch as far as Santee. It will 
move north, from downtown to Old Town and will soon service the new Convention 
Center as well. 
</P>
<P>
Tuomi said the No. 1 traffic hot spot of the 1990s is Interstate 5, 
specifically the junction of Interstates 5 and 805. 
</P>
<P>
"Interstate 5 carries more than 200,000 cars a day now," Tuomi said. "In 1980, 
the number was 100,000, so it's doubled in a decade. We're expecting 310,000 
cars a day on I-5 by the year 2000. That's definitely a source of concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Interstate 8 is our most heavily traveled freeway, handling about 270,000 cars 
a day. We expect to hold at that number until the year 2000. The traffic growth 
of East County is no longer as fast or fierce as up north. We expect the 
extension of California 52, which now goes from I-5 to Tierrasanta, to be 
extended to Santee and to ease the west-east burden dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
The other major transportation conflict of the 1990s will be the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Koerper, SANDAG's special projects director, said the question of what to 
do with Lindbergh Field will be resolved in the Nineties, one way or the other. 
If it isn't, if procrastination rules, then that in itself will be a decision, 
Koerper said: "Some people don't act until there's a crisis, so maybe we'll 
have one." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy objects to making Miramar Naval Air Station the site of a new regional 
air facility, although the air station comes up repeatedly among the panels 
charged with making a decision on a new location. The Navy says the air station 
is not now and never will be available to civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
Koerper sees potential crises as an air crash in the downtown area, traffic so 
ugly on Harbor Drive that "you'll have to arrive two hours early to catch your 
flight." 
</P>
<P>
"Or we might have our air-carrier service curtailed because of use restrictions 
on the runway," he said. "Lindbergh might be taxed with one big convention 
after another coming in to use the Convention Center. We'll find we don't have 
the airport to accommodate the Convention Center, and then we'll do something." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Prognosis 
</P>
<P>
Tayman and others say San Diego "will be more big-city in the years to come," 
taking on the good, and the bad, that come with high-level urban living. 
</P>
<P>
We may see a downtown sports arena, and a professional basketball or hockey 
team to play in it; we should see at least one more Super Bowl (probably in 
'93); at least one baseball All-Star Game (for sure in '92) and maybe another 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Tayman and others think planning is sophisticated enough here to prevent San 
Diego from becoming a crude clone of its northern neighbor, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically," said Schetter of the Chamber of Commerce, "our organization was 
formed in 1870, and the issues they were talking about then -- housing, 
transportation, water, commerce, jobs, crimes . . . are the same ones we're 
talking about now. We seem to have done pretty well between then and now. I see 
no reason why we can't move forward with hope." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On a Growth Curve: PROFILE OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
An older and higher-income population of San Diegans will crowd into more 
expensive houses in the year 2000, planners predict. The county expect to add 
about 400,000 new residents in the 1990s. While much public attention has been 
given to the projected rise in Hispanic population, it is the Asian population 
that will have the largest relative growth.

VALLEY CENTER'S HOMELESS PUT BLAME ON BUILDING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madge May put most of her savings into a nice piece of property in Valley 
Center and planned to build a little house for herself and her 6-year-old 
daughter in the pretty little town. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, she still waits for a chance to build her dream home, unable 
to obtain a building permit because of a 9-year-old building moratorium in the 
valley and unable to sell the land to anyone else. She and her daughter have 
been living in a white frame garage on the property, "roughing it" without 
proper toilets or electricity and hoping that inspectors look the other way. 
</P>
<P>
Her washer and dryer sit unused and unplugged in a corner while she goes to the 
coin laundry each week. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew there was a building moratorium, but I thought the sewer was going in," 
May said about buying the 3-acre parcel. "My friend (Bob Winsett) sold it to me 
for a modest price. He had bought it in 1978, and the taxes were eating him 
up." 
</P>
<P>
May had good reason to believe that Valley Center was going to get a sewer 
system when she bought her land. The Valley Center Municipal Water District had 
been working on sewer plans for the central part of the valley since 1975. The 
county Board of Supervisors in 1980 imposed a building moratorium because the 
valley's septic systems posed a health hazard. The moratorium brought a federal 
grant for the $13-million sewer project -- and construction of the sewer 
project would have meant the end of the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
But, over the years, the population around the valley had changed from farmers, 
dairymen and ranchers to retirees, young families and others seeking to escape 
from the urban hubbub. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to the valley northeast of Escondido moved there for much the same 
reasons that Madge May did: to get away from noise and traffic and smog. The 
thought of a "country town" with tract housing and traffic signals and shopping 
malls that a sewer system would allow welded the valley's residents into an 
slow-growth, anti-sewer coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after May bought her property, the slow-growth coalition campaigned for 
and won the right to have a deciding vote on any project by the local water 
district costing more than $1 million. The sewer project was dead and the 
federal grant withdrawn. Only the decade-old moratorium remained. 
</P>
<P>
Although she has plenty of space for a septic system, May cannot put one in 
because of the moratorium, which was placed on 3,200 acres of the central 
valley area after the rainy years of 1978 and 1979. During the late 1970s and 
early '80s, ground-water levels in the valley rose nearly to the surface and 
septic systems contaminated the runoff. Eleven septic systems failed. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, Madge May has attempted to "talk sense" to county 
officials and win an exemption from the building moratorium. After all, the 
rainy years are long past and the ground water has receded so low that it would 
take a 40-day deluge to bring them back up to contamination levels, she argues. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was "a political move" to give the local water district the 
"emergency situation" it needed to win a federal grant for a sewer system, she 
said. Now, in the driest year in the past century, why can't the county Board 
of Supervisors allow one financially strapped woman to build one small septic 
system? 
</P>
<P>
Runoff from May's septic system would raise the Valley Center ground-water 
level by only 0.4 of an inch in 1,000 years, engineers tell her. 
</P>
<P>
"And the irony of it is that I could plant my 3 acres in citrus and put 
3-million gallons of irrigation water into the ground every year and do it 
legally," May said. "It just doesn't make sense. But, no matter what you say, 
no matter how rational you are, they just won't listen." 
</P>
<P>
May is not alone. A lot of property owners are in the same fix -- unable to do 
a thing with their property. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Benson owned industrially zoned property in the moratorium area and 
complains that "the only thing I could do was pay taxes on it and graze horses 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lloyd, a Valley Center businessman, said merchants in town "are being held 
hostage by the moratorium." How can the town grow and businesses thrive when a 
person can't even add a bedroom, he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Sharp has owned property in the moratorium area for more than a dozen 
years and planned to build his retirement home there. He isn't getting any 
younger, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Val Wynn, a civil engineer with offices in Valley Center, pointed out that the 
moratorium has forced development out of the logical "town center" onto the 
edge of town. The school district had to build its new schools out on the 
fringe of Valley Center. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening, businessmen and town folk agree, is that Valley Center is 
growing around the edges, leaving the moratorium area bare, like a hole in the 
middle of a doughnut. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Waltz, assistant chief of county environmental health services, 
sympathizes with people caught in moratorium, especially with Madge May. 
</P>
<P>
"I admire her greatly," Waltz said of May. "She has tremendous perseverance." 
</P>
<P>
But Waltz takes issue with those who say the building ban is no longer needed 
in these dry years. Despite the lack of rainfall for the past three winters, 
Waltz said, there are still septic tank failures in Valley Center and the 
ground-water level has not retreated all that much. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors echoed her opinion earlier this month when they refused to 
lift the Valley Center building moratorium. Perhaps because of the plight of 
May and the dozens of other property owners caught in the building ban, 
slow-growth forces and building advocates are slowly edging toward a 
compromise: sewers in a rural community. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Tisdale, chairman of the Valley Center Planning Group, reports that "the 
key players in extremely diverse factions" are coming together to revise the 
community plan, lowering the high-density zoning that was imposed in 
anticipation of a sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Knust, who represents the pro-sewer forces, says "both sides do not agree 
wholeheartedly on anything," but acknowledges that "they are talking for the 
very first time." 
</P>
<P>
Madge May is in the center of the peace negotiations, coming home from work for 
a quick meal with her daughter in their rustic shed, then rushing off to a 
subcommittee meeting, which often lasts well into the night. 
</P>
<P>
She resents the time it is taking and admits that daughter Amy views the latest 
shift in the growth vs. no-growth battle as "just another thing that takes me 
away from home for three or four hours at a time." 
</P>
<P>
May doesn't know if the compromise talks will earn her the right to build her 
house, and she's getting mighty tired of the fight and the pioneer existence 
she and her daughter are forced to live. 
</P>
<P>
"But then I think, what else can I do?" she said. 
</P>

<P>
Some things they said during the 1980s: 
</P>
<P>
Claude Gilbert, answering a booster's criticism about the red-and-white 
uniforms worn by San Diego State's football team in 1980: "I designed those 
uniforms. I've been catching hell here for eight years, and I'll keep catching 
hell. But you know something? I don't care. We're going to keep those uniforms 
until you get yourselves a new football coach." 
</P>
<P>
The red-and-white uniforms were gone in 1981. So was Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
Don Coryell, on the SDSU administration's firing of Gilbert: "They've got their 
heads so far underground they can't see." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Donald Sterling's promises were hollow. 
</P>
<P>
Take this one from 1981: "One day, it will be harder to get a Clipper ticket 
than it will be to get a Charger ticket." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
An irate Rich Gossage struck out at Padre owner Joan Kroc in the aftermath of 
the clubhouse beer ban in 1986: "She's poisoning the world with her 
hamburgers." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey, on the reaction of his new wife, Candace, to his revelation that 
he might have fathered two babies out of wedlock: " . . . Her greatest line to 
me was, 'Well, at least I got you off the streets.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jim McMahon, commenting on Brigham Young University before the 1981 Holiday 
Bowl: "I don't have a lot of fond memories of school. In fact, I hate school. 
Once I graduate and get to the NFL, I won't be coming back here." 
</P>
<P>
Jim McMahon, responding to a reporter's questions in 1989 by blowing his nose 
at him: "There's an answer for you." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Fouts could be surly in postgame interview situations, particularly after a 
game such as the 34-27 loss to Oakland in the 1981 American Football Conference 
championship game. A microphone thrust through a crowd of reporters veritably 
brushed his beard. 
</P>
<P>
"Get this damn thing out of my mouth," he snarled. 
</P>
<P>
He looked up. The offending reporter was his father, Bob, a broadcaster in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Charger defensive back Pete Shaw, lamenting the 1981 trade that sent wide 
receiver John Jefferson to the Green Bay Packers after a long contract 
squabble: "A lot of players are angry about this. We feel a deep loss, like a 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Fay, the owner of New Zealand, complaining that Dennis Conner and his 
catamaran, Stars &amp; Stripes, had "dogged it" in winning the 1988 America's 
Cup races off Point Loma: "I don't think that other boat was raced at all out 
there today. It was disappointing to see a competitor ahead of us parked . . . 
We would rather have been beaten by a greater margin than see a competitor sail 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Former San Diego State basketball Coach David Gaines: "You know what you call a 
guy who finishes last in a class of 25 at medical school? You call him doctor. 
You know what you call a coach who finishes last? You call him fired." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines was fired after SDSU tied for last in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A classified advertisement from 1980, when Ozzie Smith and his representative 
were trying to squeeze a better contract out of the Padres: "Padres baseball 
player wants part-time employment to supplement income. College education. 
Willing to work. Prefer PR-type employment. Needs hours tailored to baseball 
schedule but would quit baseball for right opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Kroc offered him a job as a gardener. 
</P>
<P>
He is doing quite well these days with the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield, after leaving the Padres and signing a 10-year contract worth 
$15 million with the New York Yankees following the 1980 season: "Hey, I'm 
ready, I paid my dues, I need some attention. I feel good about my supporting 
cast." 
</P>
<P>
The "supporting cast" won 103 games in 1980 without him.

FOOTNOTES: QUAKE PUT DAMPER ON WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all their pluck, Bay Area workers did not accomplish much in the weeks 
after October's massive earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Companies surveyed by William M. Mercer Meidinger Hansen, a benefits consulting 
firm, reported that employees were afraid to commute to their jobs and use 
office elevators, easily flew off the handle, had trouble concentrating on work 
and were falling asleep in meetings. "Very little work got done," most 
employers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
And that just covered the workers who showed up. "At least one employee took 
early retirement on the spot, rather than return to work," according to the 
Mercer study of 39 companies employing 120,000 Bay Area residents. 
</P>
<P>
While a majority of employers reported signs of emotional distress among their 
workers in the three weeks after the Oct. 17 quake, fewer than half had taken 
steps to improve workplace safety, upgrade disaster plans or provide employees 
information about earthquake preparedness, the study found. One company brought 
in a geologist to talk to workers; three arranged direct help for employees hit 
hard by quake damage. Only two firms did nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planning to Move? Try Malta 
</P>
<P>
The weather may have been rotten, but the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta 
still hopes to capitalize on the worldwide publicity it received during the 
recent Bush-Gorbachev summit there. And California is the chief target. 
</P>
<P>
"People before were asking, 'Where is Malta?' " said Joseph Vella Bonnici, 
manager of investment promotion for the government's Malta Development Corp. 
"At least now they know where it is." 
</P>
<P>
To lure foreign investors, Malta offers a package of incentives similar to 
those provided by some other European countries, including such goodies as a 
10-year tax holiday and reduced tax rates for foreign managers. 
</P>
<P>
The government is most interested in attracting electronics firms, which could 
use Malta as a jumping-off point to market in Europe. So Bonnici said the 
development agency plans to open a promotion office in California sometime next 
year. By then, the image of President Bush trapped aboard a Navy ship for 10 
hours by high seas may be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Microwave, Mexican Style 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to microwaveable snack food, Mexican-style food is much more 
popular than ready-to-eat frozen hamburgers or packaged croissant sandwiches -- 
especially in California. A recent study by the Los Angeles office of Selling 
Areas Marketing Inc. finds that Americans spend 60 cents per capita on frozen 
burritos and only 30 cents per capita on frozen hamburgers. However, 
Californians spend two to three times the national average on frozen Mexican 
food products. 
</P>
<P>
Those reports did not go unnoticed at Four 'n Twenty, the Tustin-based 
subsidiary of an Australian company. It began to distribute a two-ounce, 
beef-filled pastry called "Aussie Snacks" in April and plans to add a 
taco-flavored pastry to its line. The product will be introduced in Los Angeles 
and San Francisco early this year, said Craig Lesly, general manager.

OCEANSIDE DRUGS, VIOLENCE BLAMED ON GANG INVASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oceanside police say drug use and violence among the city's long-established 
ethnic gangs have been overshadowed by the arrival of Crips gang members from 
Los Angeles and elsewhere looking to set up a permanent cocaine trade. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working three or four shootings by these new gangsters in town," said 
Ruben Sandoval, a seven-year veteran of the police department's gang unit, 
which was increased from two to four officers to handle the Crips. 
</P>
<P>
According to Oceanside police reports, four incidents within a 10-day period in 
October reflected the violence that they believe has been brought by the 
newcomers: 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 21, a woman was shot in the leg when she tried to stop gang members 
from using her apartment to sell drugs. She told investigating officers "that 
L.A. Crips gang members had been using her apartment to sell cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 23, two women allege they were fired at by Crips after one of the 
women told a gang member her little brother would no longer sell drugs for 
them. A victim said in the police report that "L.A. Crips had recently moved 
into the Oceanside area and had taken up selling rock cocaine" from an 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 28, a woman told police that four Los Angeles Crips forced their way 
into her apartment after beating up a man outside in a drug dispute. She said 
gang members had been trying to use her apartment as a base for drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 31, two local men were shot and wounded by two suspects. A police 
report said one victim recounted that his assailant had claimed to be a member 
of a Los Angeles gang. The shooting occurred when one of the men warned the 
gang members to stop selling cocaine from his sister's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Such bloodshed has become commonplace in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles 
and San Diego. But drug-related violence by outsiders is new to the 130,000 
people of Oceanside, where gang fighting was largely confined to Hispanic and 
Samoan gangs arguing over their turf. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that about 15 to 20 Los Angeles-based Crips first came to Oceanside 
in the summer of 1988, selling cocaine from hotels and motels on the weekends, 
and returning to Los Angeles during the week. 
</P>
<P>
They dealt drugs for six months until some were arrested; beefed up police 
patrols pressed most of the others to leave, evidenced by a sharp decline in 
cocaine sales, say police. "We were saturating the streets with 50 to 70 
officers," said Oceanside police Chief Lee Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
A few months of peace followed, but last summer a new batch of Crips arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"There were more of them," said Sandoval, about 35 or 40, he estimated. Most 
came from Los Angeles, but police learned from driver's licenses and vehicle 
registration that others came from San Bernardino, Lancaster and Perris. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is, they're going into certain residential areas and buying off 
the homeowners by giving them drugs or paying them," Sandoval said. The Crips 
live here, but resupply themselves with drugs from Los Angeles, he said.

An alarmed Drummond initiated a $20,000 study of the city's gang problem by law 
enforcement consultants, including Manuel Ortega, police chief in Bell-Cudahy, 
and Lt. Paul Jefferson of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The study, released last month, concluded that "gang-related crime in 
Oceanside, while still largely confined to traditional turf wars, (has) 
recently taken on a distinctly more dangerous and criminal nature" because of 
the arrival of "predatory gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside police believe their city has attracted the Crips because it is 
located between Los Angeles and San Diego and it represents a new market for 
rock and crack cocaine. "If gone unchecked, they could set up a lucrative 
market here," Drummond said. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old Oceanside woman, who used to sell crack bought from Los Angeles 
Crips living in Oceanside, said there's opportunity here. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones who come down here are small frys up there, but down here they're 
really big," said Leilani, who spoke on the condition that her street name and 
last name not be used. She said a quantity of cocaine that sells for $5 in Los 
Angeles gets $20 in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
She said Crips enlist "rushers" who stand outside a crack house to make quick 
transactions with buyers who drive or walk buy, and also hire drug users to 
deal cocaine for them downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"If their dope is good, each of five rushers can make $1,000 or more a day," 
Leilani said. Crips "like to have 13- and 14-year-olds selling for them because 
when they get into trouble, they're just going to juvenile hall, but they're 
not going to do no big time." 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval said police have arrested more than 100 users and dealers over the 
last three months and 10 search warrants have been issued to enter suspected 
drug houses. Scores of arrests have been made around the 200 block of North 
Hill Street, where Rick Trevino, Sandoval's partner for three years, said 
people working for the Crips were doing a brisk and highly visible business. 
"They were blatantly dealing," said Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
But downtown, cocaine street sales appear to have fallen over the last few 
weeks, and Sandoval believes the lull may be caused by the cold nights or the 
increased police enforcement.

rise in violence and drug sales on an influx of members of the Crips gang from 
Los Angeles and other areas. Police say gang members do a brisk business,

Jack McKeon, Padres: McKeon, hired as vice president/baseball operations in 
September 1980, turned the Padres' franchise from a laughingstock into a prized 
possession. And as the citizens of San Diego have learned, it's not wise to 
become emotionally attached to any player. McKeon has engineered trades 
involving 165 players since his arrival. Their 1990 spring-training roster 
consists of just four players -- Tony Gwynn, Eric Show, Garry Templeton and Ed 
Whitson -- who opened the 1987 season with them. They don't call him Trader 
Jack for nothing.

Tony Gwynn, Padres: It took just one minor league season for the Padres to be 
convinced that they had something special on their hands. Of course, when 
you've got a guy batting .331 in rookie league and .462 in double-A, it doesn't 
take a genius to figure he might have some major league talent. What 
materialized was four National League batting championships, five All-Star 
appearances and an image that would put Wally Cleaver to shame. Gwynn is the 
pride and joy of the Padres, and one day just might be standing behind a podium 
at Cooperstown, being inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Newby-Fraser has become a household name on the triathlon circuit. She has won 
three Ironman Triathlons and more than 40 other championships, including the 
two in San Diego this year, the Bud Light and San Diego International. For 
winning all of these titles, she has won more than $100,000. A native of 
Zimbabwe, South Africa, Newby-Fraser started her racing career in Europe in 
1985. She finished third in the Ironman Triathlon that year -- and then got

Ron Newman, Sockers: He has had plenty of critics, including players who don't 
always see eye-to-eye with his sometimes unorthodox methods. But the Sockers 
have won seven championships this decade under him. Newman has always had a 
knack for molding players from all over the world, with vastly different 
backgrounds, into a unit that wins. They fight, but they win. Newman has also 
established himself as an innovator, coming up with new strategies each season 
to keep a step ahead of other coaches -- and even the referees.

The Sockers: Who else? Seven championships. Each year, they have to think up a 
new slogan. We've seen: "Twice is not Enough." "Keep the Streak Alive." "One 
for the Thumb." "The Joy of Six." "Seven is Heaven." Every few years, new 
players come in to boost them to a new title. Mainstays of the first group were 
Juli Veee, Jean Willrich and Kaz Deyna. Brian Quinn and Kevin Crow came along 
in 1983, Branko Segota and Steve Zungul in 1984. And goalies Zoltan Toth and 
Victor Nogueira have anchored championships the past two seasons. The biggest 
threat to the Sockers' dominance in the '80s wasn't any one particular team but 
the Major Indoor Soccer League, which nearly folded several times because of 
financial difficulties.

1984 Padres: The improbable Padres, never before taken seriously, rode their 
second winning season all the way to their first World Series. They captured 
the hearts of the city like no other sports team, and maybe that's what helped 
them reach the Series. Nobody wanted the fun to end. They finished the regular 
season 92-70 but opened the National League playoffs in Chicago by dropping two 
consecutive games. Facing a sweep, the Padres returned to San Diego after Game 
2 to find a few thousand fans waiting in the San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
parking lot. Recharged, the Padres became the first team in NL Championship 
Series play, and the second team in Championship Series history, to overcome an 
0-2 deficit and win a series. The fun finally ended, though, when the Padres 
were defeated by Detroit in the World Series, four games to one.

1981-82 NFL playoffs, Chargers vs. Dolphins: On the day after New Year's, 1982, 
Rolf Benirschke's 27-yard field goal at 13:52 of overtime finished a dramatic, 
41-38, Charger victory in the Orange Bowl in one of the great games in NFL 
history, one that both teams seemed to have won several times. Both Dan Fouts 
and Miami's Don Strock passed for more than 400 yards. The Chargers had and 
blew a 24-0 lead. But for many, the indelible impression is tight end Kellen 
Winslow being carried off the field, exhausted from his heroic effort.

Judy Sweet, UC San Diego athletic director: The UC San Diego athletic program 
flourished under Sweet, the first woman to become athletic director at a school 
that had a combined men's and women's program in 1975. But it wasn't until the 
'80s that the Tritons exploded on the NCAA Division III scene. UCSD teams won 
11 national titles in the '80s, finished second 14 times and third 12 times. 
During that span, UCSD had 300 All-Americans, 18 academic All-Americans and two 
NCAA post-graduate scholarship winners. While the Tritons were making their 
presence felt in Division III, Sweet was making an impact in the NCAA. She was 
vice president of Division III from 1986-88 and became the first women to be 
elected secretary-treasurer of the NCAA in 1989.

with a .702 (283-120) winning percentage, easily the best in the nation. 
Multiple All-Americans included Louise Schwartz (1981, '82 and '83), Tammy Smit

it because of a freak accident in the semifinals of the NCAA championships at 
UCLA. SDSU, which defeated UCLA twice during the regular season, led 1-0 when a 
UCLA player fell, rolled under the net and over middle blocker Toni Himmer's

he became the Titans' coach in 1978. Branstetter's teams have dominated county 
wrestling, winning the section 3-A title on the mat every year since 1982, when 
3-A competition began. (The Titans had to forfeit in 1986 because they used an

</P>

MARKETING: THE NEW DATA ON PREFERENCES WILL LIKELY ADD TO ADVERTISERS' 
PERPLEXITY OVER HOW TO REACH THIS POTENTIALLY LUCRATIVE, BUT CULTURALLY AND

<P>
Although Asian consumers have a reputation for frugality in their homelands, 
where saving is encouraged, their Asian-American counterparts are avid shoppers 
-- generally less concerned about price and convenience than they are about 
quality, according to new research. 
</P>
<P>
The findings are bound to renew the debate among advertisers and marketers 
about how to best reach America's rich mix of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, 
Filipinos and Southeast Asian immigrants, as well as highly assimilated 
Asian-Americans. Although such consumers are widely viewed by Madison Avenue as 
a potentially lucrative market because of their comparatively high incomes and 
education levels, differences in language and culture make them difficult to 
reach, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Most advertisers think that all they need to do is simply translate an English 
ad to reach this market," said David Chen, executive vice president of the Los 
Angeles advertising firm Muse Cordero Chen &amp; Baca. "But there are problems 
with that; there are many differences among Asian people. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand advertisers being concerned with the difficulty," Chen said, 
"but it's not a difficulty we cannot overcome. Themes like stressing quality 
have universal appeal" among many Asian groups. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the SRI/Gallup organization of Lincoln, Neb., found that in choosing 
a product, 67% of 779 Chinese-American consumers surveyed ranked the quality of 
the product more important than price, store location or service. Similarly, an 
SRI/Gallup survey last year of 400 Japanese and Korean households in Southern 
California found that while there were "significant" cultural differences 
between the two groups, both "are upscale shoppers with rapidly expanding 
purchasing power." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, both Impact Resources of Columbus, Ohio, and the Find/SVP 
research organization in New York found Asian-Americans to be avid shoppers who 
are generally more concerned about product quality than the general population. 
For instance, while price was more important to the total population than among 
the 3,251 Asian-Americans surveyed in the Impact study, 54% of the 
Asian-Americans said quality is the most important reason for selecting a men's 
clothing outlet, compared to 50% of the total population. 
</P>
<P>
Quality, of course, is a subjective concept, and it is still unclear to many 
experts why Asian-Americans embrace certain brands or whether they will remain 
loyal to them as they become more acculturated. Nevertheless, some marketing 
specialists believe that companies should continue to direct special campaigns 
at even highly assimilated third- and fourth-generation Asians, although 
convincing advertisers of that approach has been difficult.

"We've been banging on the door since 1985, and now we're beginning to see 
greater acceptance of the Asian market," said Greg Sullivan, president of Asian 
Television Sales, a San Francisco company that sells advertising time on three 
Asian-language television stations, including KSCI in Los Angeles. "What 
advertisers don't realize is that if you are an Asian immigrant, 80% of this 
stuff on TV you've never heard of." 
</P>
<P>
Concentrated in three areas -- California, Hawaii and the New York metropolitan 
area -- Asian-Americans represent a large and rapidly growing market. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian population has increased 67% since 1980 in Los Angeles County alone, 
according to a 1987 Census Bureau estimate. And because the mean family income 
of Asian-Americans is about $10,000 higher than that of Latinos, their buying 
power is substantially greater, said Holmes Stoner, head of Artesa Media 
Services, a Los Angeles ad agency that specializes in marketing to Latinos and 
Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, unlike Latino immigrants who come from countries closer to the United 
States, Asians are not as familiar with the broad universe of American goods. 
As a result, many Asian-Americans flock to a dominant brand deemed "the best" 
by their immigrant neighbors, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
For example, studies conducted between 1986 and 1988 by SRI/Gallup found that 
40% of Chinese consumers surveyed used Tide laundry detergent, 44% of Koreans 
used Ajax cleaner and 70% of Japanese used either Crest or Colgate toothpaste. 
No other brand had more than a 10% share in each of those product categories. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many experts see a tremendous opportunity to instill brand loyalty 
and grab a large share of the Asian-American market by trumpeting the quality 
or the prestige of their product to newly arrived Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
In advertising to the general public, for example, Metropolitan Life Insurance 
Co. of New York runs ads featuring the comic strip character Snoopy saying, 
"Get Met; it pays." But in a special campaign directed at Chinese- and 
Korean-Americans, the company stresses its prestige, as well as Asian values 
such as financial security and family responsibility. Instead of showing 
Snoopy, the ads shows several massive office buildings owned by Metropolitan 
Life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a more tangible identification of where our financial strength lies," 
said William Orton, a marketing executive with Metropolitan Life. "We did a 
fair amount of market research in terms of what major themes would appeal to 
the Asian community . . . We emphasize the prestige of dealing with a company 
that was here yesterday and will be here tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Las Vegas hotels such as the Desert Inn and Caesars Palace have held 
Chinese New Year parties, advertised on Asian-language TV and put on other 
glossy promotions stressing the quality and prestige of their hotel's 
accommodations to entice both Asian-American and foreign tourists. Caesars also 
has marketing offices throughout Asia -- as well as in heavily Chinese-American 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The Asian community is a significant market for Caesars Palace; we try to 
emphasize (to them) the elegance and ambience of our world-renowned resorts," 
said Jack Leone, a vice president at Caesars World Inc. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T has taken a somewhat different approach. Last year, it became the 
first U.S. company to air a regional television commercial with entirely 
Japanese dialogue, said Mark N. Burgess, AT&amp;T's acting director for 
international advertising. The 30-second ad, which had English subtitles, shows 
a Japanese-American man calling long-distance to a colleague in Japan to relate 
a joke told to him by his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Some Asian-American advertising executives, as well as the 157-page study 
published in December by Find/SVP, prefer AT&amp;T's general market approach, 
saying it's a waste of money to specifically target the Asian-American market. 
They say Asian cultures are too different to reach efficiently with one kind of 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though Asian people who come here have their own ethnic television, the 
majority are watching regular network TV," said Clifford Yuguchi, president of 
the Los Angeles advertising firm Bozell/Yuguchi Inc. "What companies ought to 
do is pull off some of those white people and show more Asians." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Ching, executive director of the Chinatown Service Center in Los 
Angeles, says she, too, would like to see more Asian-Americans on TV. But she 
said she is turned off by some efforts that have "racist and sexist" depictions 
of "Asian men as less than masculine and Asian women as exotic, desirable and 
subservient." She cited as particularly offensive the Singapore Airlines' 
"Singapore Girl" commercial that shows attractive female flight attendants 
serving passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Candiotti, a spokesman for Singapore Airlines, responded: "It's true that 
the presentation of Singapore girl has been one of our ongoing ad campaigns for 
several years. To us, the Singapore girl is symbolic of our high level of 
service. Their uniforms are actually quite modest; they wear ankle-length 
dresses. We do not view the ads as being sexist or racist." 
</P>
<P>
Although many marketers say they are moving away from unfavorable Asian 
caricatures, there are still slip-ups and outright mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Playboy magazine once wished Chinese celebrants "Year New Happy" in a full-page 
newspaper ad. And Filipinos -- the nation's largest Asian-American group -- are 
sometimes mistakenly lumped with Latinos by marketers because Filipinos often 
have Spanish surnames. 
</P>
<P>
A more practical problem in reaching the Asian market is the lack of national 
media. Unlike Spanish-language television, which has two national broadcasting 
networks, there is no national Asian TV. Instead, regional systems -- such as 
KSCI Channel 18 in Los Angeles and KTSF Channel 26 in San Francisco -- provide 
programming in areas with large Asian populations. 
</P>
<P>
The print medium is even more fragmented. In Southern California, there are at 
least 15 Vietnamese-language newspapers, more than a dozen Chinese newspapers 
and three Japanese papers. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you are willing to get in there and get your hands dirty, the 
(Asian-American) market can be really intimidating," said Stoner of Artesa 
advertising. "You can't go out there with a typical kind of ad and try to be 
all things to all people." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although Find/SVP agreed with other experts that Asian-Americans have a 
"commitment to obtaining products and services noted for having the 'best' 
quality" the study went on to conclude that: "In reality, each of the separate 
Asian-American ethnic groups is a separate ethnic market. The only 
characteristic they all have in common is their 'American-ness.' And it is only 
through their 'American-ness' that the various groups can be reached through 
the same marketing campaign."

A DOZEN WHO SHAPED THE 80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's image as a pacesetter held up fairly well in the 1980s in the 
world of business and economics. Californians were a force for dramatic change. 
</P>
<P>
Some achieved change on a grand scale -- inspiring a revolution in economic 
policy or transforming corporate finance. Some of the change may seem minor, 
but it altered our daily routines and our life styles. Some business people 
built firms that are monuments to America's spirit of enterprise; others 
brought companies to ruin and became symbols of corporate recklessness. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of California residents who gave American business a 1980s 
makeover -- making it better, or worse, or just more fun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ARTHUR B. LAFFER 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Arthur B. Laffer's name was a household word. The crusading 
analyst was a leader of the supply side movement, a band of ideological 
outsiders who stressed lower tax rates as the key to economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
But the outsiders became insiders in Ronald Reagan's White House. Laffer's 
famous mathematical curve gave the president an intellectual tool to justify 
tax cuts. And the efforts were rewarded when Congress slashed taxes in the 
Reagan years, dropping the top individual rate to 33% from 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have blamed Laffer and other tax-cut advocates for the federal budget 
deficit -- estimated at $152 billion in fiscal 1989 -- which has weakened the 
U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
But Laffer maintains that the cuts succeeded in stimulating economic growth and 
raising federal revenue; the deficit has persisted, he argues, because Congress 
failed to control spending. "The supply side won," he said last year. "We won." 
</P>
<P>
These days -- when not tending to his exotic collection of plants and animals 
-- Laffer, 49, spends most of his time on business travel. He is chairman of 
Laffer, Canto &amp; Associates, an economic consulting firm and merchant bank 
in La Jolla, and lives on a 17-acre mountain retreat in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a lower profile, he has kept a hand in politics. He mounted an 
unsuccessful bid in 1986 for the Republican senatorial nomination. Last summer, 
he was among a group of experts who advised President Bush on economic matters 
at a Camp David meeting. And in October he helped Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.) 
fashion a proposal to cut the capital gains tax, which prevailed on the House 
floor. JONATHAN PETERSON

INFLATION RATE TO SETTLE AT 4% IN 1990, S&amp;P SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: PRICES FOR AUTOMOBILES, FOOD AND CLOTHING ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN FLAT. 
GAS HEATING, INSURANCE AND HEALTH-CARE COSTS COULD RISE.

<P>
The inflation rate for 1990 is likely to remain in the 4% range after an 
initial surge early in the year, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The December cold wave will leave us with a January hangover of higher prices 
for heating oil, other energy, and fresh fruits and vegetables," the financial 
services company said in its semiannual consumer price forecast. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices will return to their recent 4% track. By late in the year, the soft 
economy should push consumer price inflation even below that figure." 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P warned that the inflation trend, however moderate, will raise concern 
at the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with a soft economy, the Fed will continue to watch the inflation 
measures very carefully," the report said, stressing that the Fed has failed to 
bring the inflation rate close to the zero level during the past seven years of 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Cars and air fares are the indicators that will contribute the most toward 
keeping the inflation rate down, S&amp;P said. 
</P>
<P>
"Domestic automobile prices will remain flat or decline in 1990. . . . 
Slackening consumer demand will cause prices on many 1990 models to drop," 
Joshua Harari, S&amp;P auto analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
"Airlines will not be successful in raising their fares more than 1% to 2% in 
1990, and Eastern Airlines may continue to offer discounts in an effort to 
rebuild its traffic to prestrike levels," predicted Thomas Canning, S&amp;P 
airline analyst. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P analysts also expected prices for clothes and food items to remain 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
"Stable raw material, a flood of imports and a sluggish overall consumer 
market" will keep clothing prices at least at a stable level or possibly drive 
them lower, the report said. Food prices are projected to increase by 4% next 
year, down from 6% in 1989, with only luxury items and tomato products -- 
suddenly in high demand -- likely to go up. 
</P>
<P>
"An oversupply of restaurants -- more than 80,000 franchise chain outlets in 
the United States -- will also keep the price of eating out in check," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Major items expected to increase in price are gas heating, insurance rates and 
health-care costs, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers should be prepared to shell out 8% to 9% for natural gas home fuel 
costs next year," the report warned, adding some good news for electricity 
consumers who should see only a small 2% rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
But oil industry analyst Edward Graves predicted that drivers would get a break 
as gasoline prices drop following a softening in crude oil prices "in early 
1990 from their current $21 a barrel to $19 a barrel." 
</P>
<P>
Graves predicted that overproduction by the 13 members of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries would drive prices down, with the cartel's output 
remaining at 23.5 million barrels a day, for a stagnant demand of 21 million 
barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
Medical bills should increase by more than twice the projected rate of 
inflation, in the double-digit range, reflecting expensive drugs, and cuts in 
Medicare and Medicaid programs, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The soaring health-care costs will be matched only by property and casualty 
premium hikes, in the 10% to 12% range, with insurers likely to work their way 
around legislation aimed at capping the rates.

AT&amp;T RINGS IN DECADE WITH STATE RATE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new year and new decade spell lower telephone rates, effective this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph cut its prices for long-distance calling 
within California by an average of 8.6%, an annual savings to AT&amp;T 
customers of $113.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company earlier announced a $300-million reduction in tolls for calling 
between states and abroad, also effective New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Most local callers in the state also get a price break today. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission ordered Pacific Bell's rates cut 
$391 million a year, effective Jan. 1, saving the residential customers about 
$1.15 on the typical $26 monthly bill. 
</P>
<P>
That reduction will appear as a percentage credit subtracted from January and 
subsequent bills until the PUC gets around, later this year, to recalculating 
the specific price changes for local services provided by Pacific Bell and the 
state's second largest local carrier, Thousand Oaks-based GTE California. 
(GTE's rates, which were sharply lowered a year ago, will start the new year 
unchanged.) 
</P>
<P>
The AT&amp;T rate cut will reduce the cost of a 5-minute, weekday call between 
Los Angeles or San Diego and San Francisco to $1.06 from $1.20. A 10-minute 
call anywhere in the nation will cost up to $2.50. Since Monday is a holiday, 
daytime rates are discounted by 33% to 47% after 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T spokeswoman Linda McDougall attributed most of the reductions to state 
and federal regulators. All but $7 million of the California cut stems from a 
1985 order by the PUC that began a seven-year reduction in what long-distance 
carriers pay local phone companies for completing calls and a corresponding 
increase in what local customers pay Pacific Bel and GTE California. 
</P>
<P>
The interstate reduction is based on a similar cost shift ordered by the 
Federal Communications Commission, which regulates interstate service. Phone 
customers now pay a $3.50-a-month "subscriber line charge" to compensate local 
phone companies for revenue they used to collect from long-distance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
In all, AT&amp;T rates for calling within California have dropped 45.5% in six 
years, while interstate rates fell 40%. AT&amp;T's long-distance competitors 
have generally cut their rates proportionately.

BMI Grants HBO One-Month License Extension: Broadcast Music Inc. has agreed to 
grant a one-month extension of its license to Home Box Office Inc. "at a 
substantially higher fee." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement came in negotiations between representatives of HBO and BMI. BMI 
said that the issues raised in the lawsuit filed on Dec. 28 are still 
unresolved and that unless the parties could reach agreement in January, the 
litigation will continue. BMI filed suit against HBO to obtain a preliminary 
injunction to prevent it from using BMI repertoire on the Home Box Office 
channel after HBO's license expires Dec. 31.

$10-Million Settlement for Gold Investors: The owner of two defunct gold 
investment firms agreed to repay more than 250 investors $10 million to settle 
two U.S. District Court suits accusing him of being unable to deliver on 
contracts for thousands of ounces of gold. William M. Moreland of Weldon, 
Calif., will pay back investors at a rate of $300,000 per month beginning in 
April, said Marge Erickson, an assistant regional director of the Federal Trade 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the refund stems from an FTC case against Moreland charging that he 
sold gold contracts during 1986-88 that were unlikely ever to be delivered 
through his two Beverly Hills units, Continental Trading International Ltd. and 
Axiom III. Moreland neither admitted nor denied the allegations. (Filed August 
8, 1989, Case No. CV89-4708)

ROCKY MOUNTAIN WEST RECEIVING TOURISM BOOST FROM FAR EAST; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL INDUSTRY: AMERICA'S MOUNTAIN STATES HAVE BENEFITED FROM A MAJOR PUSH TO 
ATTRACT ASIAN TOURISTS TO THE REGION'S SCENIC VIEWS, FORESTS AND NATIONAL 
PARKS.

<P>
In every way but one, the slick new magazine that just hit the stands looks 
like every other travel mag you've picked up on airplanes and in doctors' 
offices. The articles consist of hyperbolic prose about "mountain splendor" and 
"natural wonders." The lavish color pictures show off Colorado's most scenic 
mountains, forests, rivers and national parks, and the advertisements promote 
hotels, restaurants, dude ranches and ski resorts. 
</P>
<P>
But this new journal, Colorado Gaido, is written entirely in Japanese, and the 
only newsstands where you can buy it are in Tokyo, Nagoya, Fukuoka and other 
Japanese cities. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado Gaido ("Colorado Guide") and its sister publication, Oregon Treiru 
("Oregon Trail"), both published by a Portland firm called Pacific Gateways, 
are key elements of a major new thrust across the Rocky Mountain West to 
attract tourists, and their money, from the nations of the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
"American travel markets have started focusing on the Pacific Rim as the 
high-growth area . . . the first priority," said Max Ollendorf, director of 
market development for the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration. The 
strongest push, he added, comes from the Western states. 
</P>
<P>
Manifestations of the new drive are evident throughout the region. On the ski 
slopes at big resorts like Deer Valley and Snowbird, you now see trail signs in 
Japanese as well as English. At the airport in Las Vegas, tour companies quote 
prices for their Grand Canyon sightseeing flights in yen as well as dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In the casinos at Las Vegas, you can now play Asian games of chance like Pai 
Gow and Sic Bo. At the edge of a forest not far from downtown Portland sits a 
perfect Japanese tea house, complete with tatami floors and sliding shoji 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to attract Asians is part of a larger pattern of change that is 
transforming the economic structure of the mountain West. With energy, mineral 
and timber markets in the doldrums, the Western states have been moving away 
from traditional extraction industries toward the attraction industry -- 
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"People have discovered that you can make more from a forest by leaving it in 
place and charging visitors to ski through it than you can by cutting it down 
and selling the timber," observed Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.). 
</P>
<P>
Because tourism is one of the fastest-growing industries in every Western 
state, it was natural to look for new markets. And for the states on the 
Pacific side of America, a natural place to look was the booming economies on 
the other side of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the travel councils of eight Western states pooled their money to 
fund a new promotional outfit called "Visit USA West," which exists for one 
purpose: to sell Asians on the natural wonders of the Rocky Mountain and 
Pacific Coast states. 
</P>
<P>
The sales effort seems to be scoring points. The number of Japanese tourists 
visiting Wyoming jumped this year to 8,000, double the figure for 1988, 
according to the state's Travel Development Office. Japanese skiing at resorts 
in Utah increased from "essentially zero" two years ago to 3,000 last season, 
the state Travel Council reports. 
</P>
<P>
The trend has been a boon in a part of the country that missed most of the 
1980s expansion. And since the money that foreign tourists spend here is 
counted as "export revenue" in national trade accounts, every skier from Tokyo 
schussing down Ajax Mountain at Aspen helps offset the U.S. trade deficit with 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is second only to aircraft and space equipment in total export 
revenue," said Jill Collins of the federal Travel and Tourism Administration. 
Foreign tourists spent an estimated $37.1 billion in the United States in 1988, 
a huge 25% increase over the year before. That means that foreign tourism is 
America's fastest-growing export commodity. And the Pacific Rim is the 
fastest-growing market for this "export." 
</P>
<P>
Although state tourism officials here all talk hopefully about drawing visitors 
from Taiwan, South Korea and Australia, the Pacific Rim market today is, for 
all intents and purposes, the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
For some states, this is nothing new. Hawaiian hotels have done a thriving 
trade in Japanese tour groups and honeymooners for two decades now. California 
has always been a big draw, and Alaska also has had a fairly large Japanese 
tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no such tradition for Oregon, a state whose name the Japanese 
have difficulty both pronouncing and spelling (a geography book used in 
Japanese schools shows a state called "Olegon"). And so Oregon's Division of 
Tourism set out to create an instant tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The state paid for the filming of a sentimental dramatic movie, "Oregon Nikki" 
("Oregon Diary"), which tells the story of a young Japanese boy living in 
Oregon who falls in love with the state and its natural beauty. The two-hour 
film is shown annually on the national Fuji Television network. 
</P>
<P>
The result? Recognition of the name "Oregon" among Japanese adults went from 
23% in 1986 to 78% this year. And the state broke all records by drawing about 
60,000 Asian tourists, mostly Japanese, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
For most Western states, however, appealing to Japanese tourists means breaking 
long-established routines. The standard route for Japanese travelers coming to 
Los Angeles has followed a path known in the Japanese travel trade as the 
"Golden Triangle." It consists of various stops around Los Angeles -- 
Disneyland, Universal Studios -- followed by a trip to Las Vegas, with a side 
trek to the Grand Canyon, followed by a stop in San Francisco and then the long 
flight home. 
</P>
<P>
To break that habit, the Western states are busily advertising such 
off-the-triangle wonders as Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, Colorado 
dude ranches and Salt Lake City's Temple Square. Much of this effort is aimed 
at tourists who have been to the United States once. "Many Japanese on their 
second visit don't want to go back to the same places again," explained Kasho 
Furuya, director of Pacific Rim sales for Las Vegas-based Scenic Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most successful campaign was the major promotion called "89 in 
'89." Created by Osamu "Sam" Hoshino of Utah's travel division and adopted by 
six major tour packagers in Tokyo, it took Japanese tourists along U.S. Highway 
89, the two-lane route sometimes called the most beautiful highway in America. 
The route starts at Glacier National Park on the Canadian border and winds 
south through Wyoming and Utah, passing near several other major parks before 
its terminus at the north rim of the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing is one of the major tourist businesses of the mountain region, but this 
fact has been lost on the Japanese until recently. Japanese skiers traveling 
overseas have traditionally gone to Europe or the Canadian Rockies. That, too, 
is beginning to change, thanks to major sales efforts by the big Rocky Mountain 
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
At Utah's Deer Valley, for example, Japanese skiers are greeted by Japanese 
hosts when they arrive. The resort provides Japanese-speaking ski instructors 
and Japanese-language restaurant guides. 
</P>
<P>
The number of Japanese skiers choosing Colorado seems almost certain to 
increase now that Japanese investors have purchased two of its biggest resorts, 
Breckenridge and Steamboat Springs. 
</P>
<P>
To win the Japanese market, American travel destinations have to be creative. 
Dorothy Maitland, who owns a travel agency in Kalispell, Mont., has learned to 
be creative during the past five years while making Tokyo-to-Montana packages a 
key part of her business. 
</P>
<P>
When Maitland first got the idea, she said, she was stymied by the fact that 
the Japanese like to see the sights from a train. "I said, 'This is Montana. 
The only train we've got is Amtrak from Seattle to Chicago, and that goes 
through here in the middle of the night'." 
</P>
<P>
After stewing over this dilemma for a while, Maitland hit on the solution. She 
printed up a Japanese brochure promoting the midnight rail journey as a 
romantic adventure: "the Moonlight Express." 
</P>
<P>
And it worked. "We're selling tours on that moonlight train almost every day of 
the summer," she said. "And our Japanese customers are buying like mad."

CANADIANS SWELL SALES ALONG U.S. BORDER; 
</P>
<P>
RETAIL: A STRONGER CANADIAN DOLLAR HAS HELPED BOOST U.S. SALES. BUT SOME BORDER 
RESIDENTS ARE ANNOYED BY THE SWARM OF FOREIGN SHOPPERS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian shoppers have made this holiday season jolly for U.S. retailers, but 
some residents are feeling a lack of good will toward fellow shoppers from 
across the border. 
</P>
<P>
Low U.S. prices and a comparatively strong Canadian dollar have caused 
Canadians to throng grocery stores, liquor marts and factory outlets throughout 
this border city. 
</P>
<P>
"The prices -- check it out," said Manny Hilario, 23, who drove 100 miles from 
Brampton, Ontario, to shop at the Factory Outlet Mall one recent Saturday. 
Outside, in an overflowing parking lot, Ontario plates outnumbered New York 
plates more than three to one. 
</P>
<P>
The crowded lots, long checkout lines and delays entering Canada on the area's 
three international bridges have caused tempers to rise at times. 
</P>
<P>
A group of six Niagara Falls residents announced recently that they were 
forming a group called "People Against Canadian Shoppers" to press local 
merchants to deal with the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing against them (Canadians) personally, but we do think something 
could be done to improve the situation for everyone," Steve Hughes, a spokesman 
for the group, told the Niagara Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said his group is circulating petitions blaming Canadians for everything 
from litter and rudeness to unsafely transporting gasoline across the border in 
extra tanks. 
</P>
<P>
That effort, in turn, has prompted U.S. business and tourism officials to 
hasten to assure Canadians that they are still welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to blow this out of proportion and make out that there's a major war 
going on," said Ray Wigle, spokesman for the Niagara Falls Convention and 
Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The convention and visitors bureau and the Niagara Falls Area Chamber of 
Commerce have urged businesses to clean up the trash and expand checkouts. 
Local governments have been asked to increase traffic control in order to 
reduce the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Local Canada Customs officials have asked the agency that operates the 
international bridges to expand the customs facilities and are trying to 
persuade Ottawa to allocate more staff. 
</P>
<P>
Same-day shopping traffic across the Rainbow and Whirlpool bridges has 
increased by almost 60% over the past four years, and at the Lewiston-Queenston 
bridge, the main route to major Canadian cities such as Hamilton and Toronto, 
traffic is up 107% over that period, said John Johnston, district manager for 
Canada Customs operations in Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
Theories abound as to why the number of shoppers has multiplied, though the 
year-old U.S.-Canada free trade pact isn't considered a direct cause. The 
agreement has reduced wholesale tariffs on several categories of merchandise 
but has not yet affected the duties paid by individual shoppers at the border. 
</P>
<P>
Still, free trade may have subtly boosted cross-border shopping by helping to 
strengthen the Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar trades at about 85 U.S. 
cents these days after falling as low as 70 cents earlier in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Niagara Falls, N.Y., also has a built-in price advantage because western New 
York is one of the cheaper regions of the United States, but Niagara Falls, 
Ontario, is an extension of the pricey Toronto metropolitan area, Wigle said. 
</P>
<P>
Price is not the only attraction of the United States, some Canadian shoppers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"In groceries, anything new they come out with (in the United States) is in 
Canada the year after," said Lisa Morrice of Hamilton, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. grocery chains began advertising heavily across the border in the past few 
months after seeing the stronger dollar and the increased willingness of 
Canadians to cross the bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian merchants say they can't compete with U.S. prices.

California's image as a pacesetter held up fairly well in the 1980s in the 
world of business and economics. Californians were a force for dramatic change. 
</P>
<P>
Some achieved change on a grand scale -- inspiring a revolution in economic 
policy or transforming corporate finance. Some of the change may seem minor, 
but it altered our daily routines and our life styles. Some business people 
built firms that are monuments to America's spirit of enterprise; others 
brought companies to ruin and became symbols of corporate recklessness. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of California residents who gave American business a 1980s 
makeover -- making it better, or worse, or just more fun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL MILKEN 
</P>
<P>
Michael Milken arguably has had a greater impact on American business in the 
1980s than anyone else. The 43-year-old trader radically transformed the world 
of American finance by pioneering the $210-billion market for high-risk, 
high-yield debt securities known as junk bonds -- and then landed squarely at 
the center of the nation's biggest securities fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
In fostering the junk bond market, Milken helped touch off an unprecedented 
wave of merger and acquisition activity. Some entrepreneurs built vital 
businesses with the money that Milken raised for them, and corporate raiders 
were able to launch takeovers against industry giants by using almost no money 
of their own. In many instances, as companies sought to defend themselves or as 
raiders dismantled their prey, workers were laid off by the thousands. 
Investment bankers and shareholders often walked away rich and happy. 
</P>
<P>
When Milken started work as a bond trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert in New 
York, a junk bond was debt issued by a "fallen angel," a once highly regarded 
company that had fallen on hard times. Small and mid-size companies were rarely 
able to borrow from anyone but a bank, and even that wasn't easy. But Milken 
helped hundreds of smaller firms issue bonds in the public markets in the way 
that big companies did. 
</P>
<P>
For a long while, the business was good for both Drexel, which became a 
financial powerhouse, and Milken, who earned $500 million in one year and ranks 
among the wealthiest men in America. But Drexel and Milken were charged with 
massive securities fraud. Drexel has pleaded guilty and paid a huge fine; its 
business is suffering. As for Milken, he is fighting a 98-count indictment on 
similar matters and hopes to stay out of jail. He maintains his innocence and 
has started a new financial advisory firm. KATHY M. KRISTOF

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOL PRICE 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1976, San Diego retail executive Sol Price opened a bare-bones, 
cash-and-carry store in an aircraft-hangar-sized building in an industrial 
section of his hometown. It marked the birth of a store, as well as the birth 
of an idea -- warehouse membership outlets that cater to small-business owners 
and consumers who want rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, that idea was transformed into a booming industry. But even 
as a flock of copycat companies opened similar stores, the Price Club chain 
remained a leader. 
</P>
<P>
Price, now in his early 70s and no longer running the company, was the first to 
recognize that "a real basic need of small-business customers was not being 
met," said Sarah Stack, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And, she added, "He saw that consumers were able to forgo some creature 
comforts to get the best price possible." 
</P>
<P>
Price also was early to recognize, among other things, the value of what is 
known as vertical integration, Stack said. One example: After the Price Club 
started offering optical lenses, it also got into the business of grinding 
lenses so that it could offer the product at a lower price. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas H. Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities, said another 
important innovation by Price was the introduction of a customer newsletter 
about developments at the stores. Such newsletters, he said, now are regarded 
"as a vital component of the business." STUART SILVERSTEIN

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A. W. CLAUSEN 
</P>
<P>
A.W. (Tom) Clausen -- as BankAmerica Corp.'s once and future chief executive in 
the 1980s -- was the architect both for one of the decade's biggest corporate 
declines and one of its biggest comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
He was blamed for many of BankAmerica's troubles earlier in the decade, such as 
leaving its Bank of America unit with a huge portfolio of Latin American loans 
that soured, as well as building an inefficient, bloated bank with an outmoded 
computer system. 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica's problems went beyond those loans: Key executives left amid 
turmoil, morale was low, the bank suffered an embarrassing mortgage scandal, 
and its stock was battered on Wall Street. So vulnerable was BankAmerica that 
First Interstate Bancorp launched an unsolicited $3.4-billion takeover bid in 
late 1986 that BankAmerica ultimately fought off. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it also was Clausen who returned to lead BankAmerica through a 
Chrysler-like turnaround. Clausen, 66, had left BankAmerica, the San 
Francisco-based parent of Bank of America, in 1981 to head the World Bank. 
BankAmerica was a shambles when Clausen was asked by its board to return in 
1986 to replace his successor, Samuel H. Armacost, who resigned under fire. 
</P>
<P>
Under Clausen, BankAmerica became profitable again by slashing costs, improving 
loan quality, selling assets and pushing consumer banking. More important, 
Clausen brought in a team of key executives to work the turnaround, notably 
former Seafirst Corp. President Richard M. Rosenberg, 59, who is now 
BankAmerica vice chairman and the executive considered most likely to succeed 
Clausen. 
</P>
<P>
But the clout that BankAmerica once enjoyed worldwide has diminished from the 
days when it was the nation's largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
Clausen has not indicated when he may retire. Observers speculate that he may 
leave in a year or two. JAMES BATES

THE STAR ATTRACTION OF HOLLYWOOD'S CHINA CLUB; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: CELEBRITIES OFTEN PLAY AT THE LATE-NIGHT HOT SPOT, WHERE EVERYBODY 
-- EVERYBODY WHO CAN GET IN -- IS SOMEBODY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-haired young man seemed a bit fazed on a recent Monday night when the 
doorman at Hollywood's China Club wouldn't let him enter the nightclub. After a 
trip to the side door, the man returned to explain to the doorman that he'd 
been told he would be allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, so what's your name?" asked the doorman, a tall New Yorker in a beige 
trench coat. 
</P>
<P>
The young man paused. "Well . . . Axl." 
</P>
<P>
The doorman stiffened. "That's good enough for me," he said, sweeping aside the 
people waiting to clear the entry for one W. Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns 
N' Roses. 
</P>
<P>
It's all par for the course at the China Club, the hottest nitery in town since 
it opened in August, where class division is the rule -- and perhaps the 
attraction. Before the Axl incident, as the club prepared for its 10 p.m. 
opening, the same doorman gave those waiting a convoluted explanation of how 
the entry system worked. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're on the guest list, get in this line," he said, indicating the 
20-person queue to the left of the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're not on the guest list, you have to wait here," he continued, 
motioning to a slightly longer line at the right. "Now, if you only think 
you're on the guest list, you might not be. So, unless you know you're on the 
list, don't stand in the guest-list line." 
</P>
<P>
Sound inviting? It is to many in Hollywood who all-too willingly stand in line 
-- especially on Mondays when a star-studded jam session draws celebrity guests 
only a notch below the rumors -- so they can pay $10 to be sardined around the 
elongated horseshoe bar or on the dance floor -- where it's too crowded to 
dance and too loud to talk -- and pay five bucks a pop for mixed drinks. (The 
"pro-jam" will be held tonight and, beginning next week, on Tuesdays as well.) 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, everybody's somebody here," said Stephen Eads, who has served as 
general manager of the club since it opened in August. But, of course, some 
people are more somebody than others at the China Club, a three-level, 
400-capacity facility at the Selma and Argyle site that once housed the 
punk-era Cathay de Grande. 
</P>
<P>
Though the club is used frequently for record companies to showcase 
up-and-coming artists, it's the Monday-night jams that get the buzz going. A 
few weeks ago, Elton John hopped on stage to lead the band through nine songs. 
Michael Bolton and Rick James are among those known to turn up. Even rocker 
wanna-be John McEnroe plugged in his guitar recently. 
</P>
<P>
And the rumors! 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Jeff Beck, maybe Phil Collins, maybe Eric Clapton," said club publicist 
Joe D'Ambrosio as the cozy, understatedly Chinese-themed main room started to 
fill up. On this occasion the rumors proved a bust (as was one about Paul 
McCartney the week before) -- the crowd had to "settle" for Sam Kinison and 
Gary Busey destroying "Wild Thing," plus the now-standard guest appearance of 
Who bassist John Entwistle. Word persisted through the evening that Beck was in 
the club, but that proved untrue. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some people are more somebody than others, and that is certainly, at 
least in part, what draws the lesser somebodies. 
</P>
<P>
"The general public is used to being slighted, watching premieres and parties 
on TV that they can't go to," said Belissa Cohen, who covers the night life for 
the L.A. Weekly. "So when they see it right in front of them, they're 
privileged to be there. If you see Madonna walk ahead of you to the front of 
the line, you know you're in the right place." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on that Monday, they did see Madonna, with close-cropped dark hair, 
walk by with Warren Beatty. The celebrated pair took their places at a table in 
one of the elevated areas that flanks the narrow ground-floor room where the 
nightly entertainment takes place. Others in the star contingent this night 
included Justine Bateman, actor Danny Aiello -- his son Ricky was the doorman 
that night. And Lakers owner Jerry Buss and party held a table throughout the 
night separate from, though in sight of, the hoi polloi. A guarded VIP room 
downstairs held more celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
"They make it comfortable here," Buss said while the loud house band, the Nasty 
Survivors, took a break and made conversation possible. "The security's real 
good -- you don't have to have your bodyguards." 
</P>
<P>
But, for all that, the China Club is fairly egalitarian, as these clubs go. 
There's none of that trendy snobbery about style that people accustomed to the 
likes of Vertigo expect. Both the celebs and the common folk tend to favor the 
casual look here. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the rock 'n' roll business, not the snob business," insisted Danny 
Fried, who co-owns both this club and its New York namesake, which has served 
as a successful, celebrity-filled hot spot for five years. "We don't play the 
'We don't like your clothes' games. . . . The only times it gets tight at the 
door is when it's too busy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a trendy kind of place," he continued. "We are in the music 
business. I don't cater to kids; we cater to an older, sophisticated crowd. 
That's why I'm so happy that top musicians have frequented the place. They know 
if they play they're gonna sound good and play to a crowd that appreciates it." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Buss appreciates it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only place (like it) with live entertainment in L.A., which is 
strange for the entertainment capital of the world, that we would have to 
import that from New York," Buss said. 
</P>
<P>
And even those who have to wait in line outside, often for more than half an 
hour, appreciate it too. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in L.A. for a year, and this is one of the best places I've been," 
said Erika Hjelm, a fashion designer from Switzerland, as she stood with her 
brother Jonas, a USC student. 
</P>
<P>
And the pair insisted that they'd like the club even if it weren't a great 
place for star-gazing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd still come even if there were no celebrities," said Erika. 
</P>
<P>
Belissa Cohen agreed that it's more than being able to rub elbows with the 
aristocracy that brings the public to the China Club. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be in there without knowing that David Bowie and Axl are over there," 
she said. "Some people find the conservative atmosphere pleasant. That's enough 
for them. They don't want to deal with the underground and the trendiness." 
</P>
<P>
But, if not for the impressive guest list, you'd have to wonder if the club 
could remain the hottest place in town. It certainly wouldn't draw the 
paparazzi who stake out the club religiously. 
</P>
<P>
"We give the club a lot of publicity," said celebrity photographer Al Ortega 
during his vigil. "Stuff we shoot here gets published." 
</P>
<P>
At 2:15 in the morning, after the club had closed, Ortega and several 
colleagues were still working, coaxing a complaining Justine Bateman to 
dutifully pose as she headed across Argyle to the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the China Club's magic is working. But even those who are impressed 
expect it will wear off eventually. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," marveled one record industry executive, who asked his name not 
be used because he might need to book some of his acts there in the future. "I 
wonder how long will it last."

CRITIC AT LARGE: HOPES ARISE WITH THE DAWN OF A NEW DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like birthdays, years divisible by 10 have a special aura about them. In the 
case of our private birthdays, the aura gets darker and darker as the numbers 
go up. Turning 50 has a chill about it, like a cloud passing the face of the 
sun, and let us not speak of 60 at all. 
</P>
<P>
The world's birthdays have no such darkening auras, and it is a small miracle 
of our lives that no matter how dark things have been for the individual or the 
world up through Dec. 31, New Year's Eve always carries the hope that things 
will change for the better. The hope may be as thin as a penlight at the end of 
a very long tunnel, as it has often been in wartime. But the hope is there, 
because things have always gotten better before, or so you tell yourself as the 
bells ring and the horns toot in the crisp night air. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the hard, realistic light of New Year's morning, a guarded optimism is 
at very least an allowable state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
And if the old year has ended up in a rush of good news, personal or 
collective, as this one surely has collectively speaking, then the new year 
begins with a sense of possibility that is headier than any Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
The year 1989, lately dead, and the ending decade have been memorialized and 
analyzed to a true fare-thee-well. And seeing the bits of film and tape, 
hearing the litany of new voices discovered and familiar voices gone still, and 
glimpsing again the triumphs and the tragedies, it is impressive to realize how 
much we've all borne witness to. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Mort Sahl once remarked in an album title, the future lies ahead, and 
the view from New Year's morning is indubitably ahead. Not to those 
intimidating resolutions. Yes, yes; we're all going to eat less and exercise 
more and save more and be better persons in each and every way, at least 
through Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Resolutions, unreal to begin with, tend to have rather short lives. On the 
other hand there are hopes -- and the first day of any year is nothing if not a 
time of hope -- that should last longer than the resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
I hope, for example, that the movie makers will rethink the prevailing 
conventional wisdom that only home runs count. Singles and doubles have a place 
in the Hollywood scheme of things too. Those swollen budgets, averaging $18 
million to $20 million but occasionally peaking at twice that or more, have 
deprived the movies of one of their greatest strengths -- variety. Variety in 
size, themes, tone, casting. 
</P>
<P>
The argument always is that little pictures cost as much to distribute as big 
ones so you're better off making big ones that have more selling points. The 
trouble is that the big budgets carry timid compromises, like barnacles. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs of hope already in the success of modest-cost films such as 
"sex, lies, and videotape," "Do the Right Thing" and even, in its limited 
showings, Kenneth Branagh's "Henry V." The hope at last is for more hope. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the television networks read the handwriting on the screen about their 
still-declining share of prime-time viewing. They are losing to cable, to 
independents, to VCRs. Indeed, their share of viewing time may be even lower 
than the measurers can measure. 
</P>
<P>
And what, the networks might well ask, are their viewers viewing instead? Even 
less objectionable programming, which is to say, even blander and more 
derivative stuff? Not exactly. A lot more sports, certainly, on cable, which 
feeds an evidently insatiable appetite in the society. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond sports, what we watch appears to be a mosaic of what you can only call 
the good stuff, films and specials for cable (the networks abandoned variety 
shows too quickly), plays, documentaries, profiles, news in breadth and depth 
and, not without a touch of irony, the best of what network television did in 
the past, the excellence of which now also carries a heavy icing of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
The networks' old quest for LOP (Least Objectionable Programming) is obviously 
an inadequate response to the new challenge they face. The hope is that they 
will try upgrading their offerings to a viewership that is now anything but 
captive. 
</P>
<P>
Television's not a wasteland; never was, entirely. There were oases in the 
thinnest of times, and the medium's inventiveness and immediacy have at their 
best been spectacular. The power of television's news coverage increasingly 
shapes history as well as recording it. But even here the networks are under 
siege from CNN and other quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The hope, I think, is for a counteroffensive by the networks, taking risks and 
showing their undoubted muscle, instead of cutting costs and plotting spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
I can't say I hope, but I wish that the pop music I hear seemed to originate 
deeper in the soul. For a time in the '60s particularly, the voices of rock 
spoke for a generation and reflected, early on, its angers and concerns, its 
rejection of what it saw as outworn values but its essentially positive 
aspirations for change. 
</P>
<P>
Today much of what I hear, or read about, seems to me to reflect the 
disenchantment of senders and receivers. It's hard not to sense a strained 
quest for commercial novelty, preferably built on shock value. Cynicism 
pervades the music, or probably more accurately the industry. 
</P>
<P>
It seems no accident that the possibility of a Beatles reunion holds such 
fascination for so many, or that the individual Beatle tours have done so well. 
There is a terrific nostalgia for the (relative) innocence and the romantic 
idealism that their music carried in the '60s when they owned the world. 
</P>
<P>
It is also no accident that someone like Bruce Springsteen, who has a point of 
view and whose attraction is therefore lyrical as well as musical, should 
command such a following. 
</P>
<P>
(I remember watching a 1965 rehearsal of the Byrds and a young man beside me 
shouting, "This is it! Facade show business is dead!" It isn't; it just uses 
megawatt amplifiers and wears artfully torn jeans. 
</P>
<P>
My hope, I guess, is that out there somewhere are new composer-musicians who 
are looking beyond a facile and fashionable cynicism to find new angers and 
concerns. It may well be beyond them, but we can not give up the possibility of 
change. 
</P>
<P>
There is a banquet of subsidiary hopes lurking about. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the theater will rediscover the lean, sophisticated musical as an 
alternative to the overwhelmingly spectacular musical. I hope for the spirit of 
Rodgers and Hart, as well as revivals of Rodgers and Hart. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the Los Angeles Theatre Center will hang in there, while more and more 
customers find their way to it and discover that it is a safe and exciting 
oasis in an undeniably off-putting part of downtown. The operating losses have 
not dimmed Bill Bushnell's daring as a producer, and I hope they never will. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the writers of crime fiction will ease off on drunken private eyes and 
serial killers; both are becoming not so much bores as trivializations. 
</P>
<P>
To end on a more cosmic level, I hope -- no, I pray -- that Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev holds his own against the troglodytic Old Guardsman who undoubtedly 
lie in wait for him. He has diverted us all from a collision course with 
catastrophe. The world is not free of terror or terrorists but it is 
immeasurably saner than it was a year ago, and a hope for more of the same fits 
this morning like none other.

HIDDEN POPULATION POSES CENSUS WINDFALL FOR CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a natural fear, and Quach Tho Ninh was no different than the rest. In 
the grim months after the fall of Saigon in 1975, Vietnamese authorities would 
conduct an occasional head count, marching house to house with automatic rifles 
slung over their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
This was only a census, but the questions invariably strayed. Were you in the 
army of the south? What are your beliefs? Your politics? Quach would always 
give the correct responses, the answers that would keep him alive. 
</P>
<P>
Now more than a decade has passed. Quach has come to Orange County, hoping for 
a new life. One recent day, the 46-year-old immigrant was sitting in an 
English-language class, grappling with strange new vowels and syllables, when a 
visitor appeared -- a man from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
This, Quach soon realized, was different than the homeland. The census 
employee, a slight Vietnamese man named Vong Ngo, softened up the class with a 
few one-liners in his native tongue, then explained the importance of the 
nationwide survey. 
</P>
<P>
The spiel did the trick. Afterward, Quach, without fear, was eager to 
participate in the U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
Such small victories, however, could prove the exception rather than the rule 
when the 1990 census is launched in late March. While the past decade saw 
perhaps the greatest influx of foreign newcomers in Orange County's history, 
many of those immigrants from south of the border and Indochina might go 
uncounted in the upcoming national survey. 
</P>
<P>
They are among the nation's hidden population, which also includes the 
homeless: families tucked into garages or vans, and drifters with no fixed 
addresses. Wary of the government and its emissaries, both recent immigrants 
and the homeless typically are not counted in the U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
Although the census missed about 1.4% of the overall U.S. populace in 1980, the 
undercount was greater among minorities, with the rate of omission for black 
and Latino inner-city residents pegged at 12%. 
</P>
<P>
The undercount is unfortunate, since the census serves as an important 
springboard for help. It bears directly on the distribution of about $30 
billion in federal aid and millions more in state subsidies for a variety of 
programs. Each city's share of that money is generally based on its numbers of 
poor, homeless or unemployed people. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials contend that the 1990 census can overcome the daunting 
obstacles to produce a reasonably complete count, even among immigrants and in 
the pockets of poverty that lace Orange County and other communities. The 
bureau has pressed ahead with a spate of programs to reach the types of people 
who have been overlooked in past decades. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, census officials will enlist the help of churches, schools 
and social service agencies. Outreach specialists have been dispatched to give 
presentations to community organizations, adult English-language classes and 
Head Start groups. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials also plan to hire temporary employees directly from the ethnic 
minority neighborhoods, marching into apartment complexes and housing projects 
to make a pitch for recruits. By tapping workers from the community, officials 
hope to ease the tensions and worries of residents facing the census. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County cities such as Santa Ana have also helped, promoting the census 
with videos on local cable channels and distributing literature. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau, meanwhile, is gearing up for an ambitious, one-night 
campaign to count the homeless. Dubbed "shelter and street night," the special 
push is expected to far surpass the bureau's past enumeration efforts, which 
have focused on flophouses and other places of refuge. 
</P>
<P>
But several problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau's promotional literature in Spanish and other languages has 
largely failed to materialize in district offices throughout the United States. 
Aghast at the information gap, a nonprofit Latino group has stepped in to 
provide pamphlets in Spanish for many regions of the country. 
</P>
<P>
For the Indochinese communities in Orange County, local census officials have 
resorted to producing their own literature, drawing up and photocopying 
rudimentary pamphlets for distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond logistical glitches, critics also see problems with the census form. The 
questionnaire comes only in English, with a small paragraph at the bottom 
giving a toll- free number to order a copy in Spanish. The form is unavailable 
in Vietnamese, Chinese or any of the scores of other languages spoken in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is a lot of people will not even see the paragraph at the bottom 
of the census saying they can request one in Spanish," said Berta Saavedra, 
state census coordinator for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education 
Fund. "It could cause problems. And it's even worse for people who speak other 
languages." 
</P>
<P>
Census officials attribute such drawbacks mostly to a lack of funds. But they 
insist the informational literature will be arriving at most district offices 
in January. They also stress that residents who speak another language can get 
help at special translation centers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a concern," said Fernando Tafoya, a census district manager in Orange 
County. "But it's up to all of us on the local level to get the word out, and I 
feel we've got all the bases covered. The literature is important, but what's 
even more important is the personal contact we hope to establish." 
</P>
<P>
Such a face-to-face approach could prove invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
Undocumented immigrants, most of them Latinos settled in cities such as Santa 
Ana and Anaheim, fear the census will be used by immigration officials to track 
them down. (Illegal immigrants are counted by the census, despite repeated 
efforts by some congressmen to repeal the practice.) Even those granted legal 
status under the amnesty program are sometimes filled with distrust or don't 
understand the benefits of being counted, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
New arrivals from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos carry not only fears imported from 
their homelands, but a suspicion that the census might help housing authorities 
root out large families packed into cramped apartments in immigrant enclaves 
like Orange County's Little Saigon in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our efforts have to be aimed at saturating the community with accurate 
information about the census," said Father Jaime Soto, vicar of the Hispanic 
community for the Catholic Diocese of Orange. "We need to get out the message 
that the information is confidential, and that the census could actually help 
them a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The news is only beginning to trickle out. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of Natividad, a 26-year-old Latino woman in Santa Ana. An 
illegal immigrant who asked that only her first name be used, Natividad said 
she did not know what the census is. The mother of four also said she feared 
filling out government forms because of what she believes is the threat of 
deportation. 
</P>
<P>
But Maria, another undocumented immigrant, said she planned to participate in 
the census, even though many of her friends are too frightened to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends have a lot of concern that the census is a way the government can 
find out we are here illegally," said Maria, 23, who learned about the 
nationwide survey from a Spanish-language news program. 
</P>
<P>
There are others just like them, in Anaheim, in Westminster, in Santa Ana and 
Garden Grove. And that is where people like Vong Ngo come in. 
</P>
<P>
A bespectacled 29-year-old with a wife and two children, Ngo came to the United 
States as a boat person in 1980 after five years under the communist regime in 
Vietnam. Now a community outreach specialist for the Census Bureau, he spends 
his days combing the Indochinese communities throughout Southern California, 
urging people to come forward and be counted. 
</P>
<P>
So it was that he arrived one recent day for a presentation at Cambodian Family 
Inc., a nonprofit community services agency in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Talking in a mix of English and Vietnamese, Ngo stressed that the census is 
confidential. Moreover, he pointed out how the count would actually help the 
community. More money would come for day-care centers, for health care, for 
sidewalks on a street. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to explain it in terms of how it will help their own neighborhood and 
family," Ngo said. "That's why these presentations are important. But there's 
never enough. There is no way that we can spread out the message to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Across town, Tafoya was delivering a similar talk to a room packed with about 
50 young Latino families at a community center. A murmur filled the room and 
small children in hooded jackets squirmed at their parents' feet as Tafoya 
spoke in English. But the audience grew attentive when he broke into Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Tafoya talked of building bridges. 
</P>
<P>
"You're sort of in their environment when you come out to these meetings," he 
said. "It strengthens the relationship. And it helps that we're going to give 
some of them a job with the census. The others know that their neighbor is not 
going to do something to hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
But it is a fragile trust. Some community leaders argue that unconnected events 
such as an immigration sweep a few days or weeks before the census could 
convince many immigrants not to participate. They have asked the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service for a moratorium on sweeps in the months before the 
census. 
</P>
<P>
"If they decide to raid, it'll put a damper on a complete count," said 
Saavedra. "These people don't understand that one hand of the federal 
government doesn't always know what the other is doing. When they think of the 
government, they think of the INS, IRS, FBI. It all begins to run together." 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau faces no less troubling a dilemma with the homeless. 
Street-corner preachers and bedraggled bag ladies drifting on the periphery of 
society often hold a chilling animosity toward any type of government 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the 1990 count, census officials have been putting their heads 
together with homeless advocates and others to pinpoint all the shelters and 
street locations that need to be visited. 
</P>
<P>
On March 20, the massive operation will begin across the country. Shelters and 
low-cost motels will be visited between 6 p.m. and midnight. Streets will be 
searched the next morning from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. Sleeping persons will not be 
awakened, but enumerators will estimate as best they can the person's age and 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Even with such tactics, a percentage of the United States' hidden population 
will likely remain uncounted, experts say. For many cities, that will mean less 
federal money for streets, social services and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, for instance, officials estimate that $2.5 million a year could 
be lost during the coming decade if the city's estimated 50,000 Latino 
newcomers are omitted. Officials in Los Angeles, which has an even greater 
variety of needy immigrants, say their city stands to lose $12 million annually 
if there is an under-count. 
</P>
<P>
"It boils down to the fact that if we do not count everybody, these people will 
not exist on paper," noted Santa Ana Councilman Miguel A. Pulido. "Everything 
from reapportionment to tax dollars will be affected." 
</P>
<P>
Eager to ensure an accurate tally, many state and city officials are pushing 
for the Census Bureau to use a new technique it has developed to estimate the 
nation's hidden population and adjust the census accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
The concept is similar to a 100-year-old method for counting fish in a lake. 
Immediately after the census, an intense recount will be conducted of 150,000 
randomly selected households across the country, including neighborhoods that 
have been habitually undercounted. By comparing the survey results against the 
census, the percentage of residents not included in the original count can be 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was initially endorsed by several key officials with the Census 
Bureau, but the Reagan Administration rejected the technique, prompting 
protests from critics who accused the president of playing politics. 
</P>
<P>
As the critics saw it, the Republican president opposed the concept because of 
a probable rise in population totals in areas that are Democratic strongholds. 
As a result, those regions would gain Congressional seats and more federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Several large states and cities, including California and Los Angeles, sued to 
reverse Reagan's decision. The result was a settlement in 1989 that created an 
eight-member committee that will recommend whether the survey results should be 
used to adjust the nation's population. 
</P>
<P>
But politics could still come into play, the survey's advocates contend, 
because the final decision, expected in mid-July, rests with Secretary of 
Commerce Robert Mosbacher, a Republican political appointee. 
</P>
<P>
While the intrigue continues in Washington, the mood in Orange County has 
remained one of optimism, of hope that all segments of society will be counted 
on April 1, Census Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping the census will be the beginning of a reorientation in the way we 
see ourselves here in Orange County," Father Soto said. "One of the critical 
issues facing the county will be ethnic pluralism, how we choose to engage the 
reality of who we are. The census could be a pivotal beginning to bringing that 
reality to us and making us face it."

SITTING IT OUT: Those wanting to cheer on Orange County entries in today's Rose 
Parade will be disappointed. . . . Despite a history of entries that extends, 
with lapses, back to 1917 when Santa Ana first entered, there will be no float 
from here this year. . . . "We're cutting back on all the frills," a Santa Ana 
City Hall spokesman explained. Instead, the city will be represented by the 
Santa Ana Winds Youth Band, appearing 110th in the line of march. Steve Emmons

WHAT'S NEW? From The Times Orange County in 1979: "The '70s are likely to be 
remembered as the end of Orange County's free-wheeling growth . . . roads grew 
more crowded. Environmental concerns led to constraints on development. Many 
young adults lost the American Dream of owning a house. . . . Perhaps the 
brightest note during the '70s was the rebound of Orange County's economy. . . 
. Housing and transportation . . . will be Orange County's most goading issues" 
of the '80s. . . . Sound familiar? Steve Emmons

It was a decade in which Laura Bradbury disappeared from a stark desert 
campsite, a small boy survived an inferno set by his father, the county got its 
first billionaire, septuplets were born, mountain lions attacked children and 
an animal shelter was chosen to house the homeless. Winnie the Pooh went on 
trial, Richard M. Nixon went to New York, Anaheim went up in smoke, the 
Olympics came and went, and the price of a house went through the roof. Here's 
a closer look at some of the events that made headlines in Orange County in the 
1980s: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1983: The year of the Decade 
</P>
<P>
TRAGIC MISTAKE: 
</P>
<P>
Stanton Police Officer Anthony Sperl, called to an apartment because neighbors 
had not seen the family for days, went in to investigate. Startled by a dim 
figure brandishing a handgun, Sperl fired and killed Patrick Ridge, 5, who had 
been left home alone by his working mother. Patrick had been holding a toy 
revolver. 
</P>
<P>
TRAGIC INTENTIONS: 
</P>
<P>
Charles Rothenberg, a waiter on vacation from New York, checked into a Buena 
Park motel room, put his 6-year-old son David to bed, doused the room with 
kerosene, then set it ablaze and fled. David survived but was horribly burned 
and faced years of plastic surgery and pain. His father, begging forgiveness at 
his trial, was sentenced to 13 years in prison and is due for parole in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
CAUGHT AT LAST: 
</P>
<P>
Two California Highway Patrol officers routinely stopped a car on Interstate 5 
in Mission Viejo and found a dead Marine in the seat next to the driver, Randy 
Kraft. That discovery ended a string of murders so long that prosecutors say 
they may never know the total. Six years after his arrest, Kraft was convicted 
of 16 murders, but prosecutors think that he may have committed 65 or more, the 
most in U.S. history. The trial was the county's longest (13 months, with five 
years of preparation) and most expensive (an estimated $10 million). 
</P>
<P>
DENTISTRY DEATHS: 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tony Protopappas, who built a million-dollar practice based on painless 
dentistry, was arrested and later convicted of second-degree murder after three 
patients died from his anesthesia. Protopappas was an "unqualified, arrogant 
man" who used methods as reckless as "shooting a gun into a crowd," his 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
FIRST BILLIONAIRE: 
</P>
<P>
Donald L. Bren bought control of the Irvine Co., moved to Orange County and 
instantly became its biggest wheel. 
</P>
<P>
LAST (BUT LONG) HURRAH: 
</P>
<P>
Joan Irvine Smith, great-granddaughter of the Irvine, whose ranch once covered 
one-fifth of Orange County's territory, spent three decades fighting for what 
she considered her legacy -- the Irvine Co. stock she inherited. But she was so 
at odds with new owner Bren that she decided to sell him her stock rather than 
associate with him. Hers has been a lengthy exit, however. The lawsuit over the 
selling price persists into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
PIER PRESSURE: 
</P>
<P>
Huge waves from offshore winter storms ripped away a section of the Seal Beach 
Pier. The waves returned three months later to finish the job, this time 
tearing away the end of the Huntington Beach Pier, including the End Cafe. (See 
"Goodby Again.") 
</P>
<P>
LABOR OF LOVE: 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Holland, working virtually single-handed for 13 1/2 years in his front 
yard in Costa Mesa, hand-wrought a 100-foot wooden brigantine according to 
19th-Century plans and christened it Pilgrim. As it slid into Newport Harbor, 
2,500 people cheered and scores of boats tooted -- probably the biggest and 
most festive launching crowd in the harbor's history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Rest of the Decade. . . 
</P>
<P>
CAUGHT AT LAST II: 
</P>
<P>
The Night Stalker, who sneaked into homes to rape and murder, struck in Mission 
Viejo and sent Orange County residents scurrying to buy guard dogs and guns 
(1985). Both Mission Viejo victims survived, and the attack provided the clue 
that broke the case. A 13-year-old boy's description of a suspicious vehicle 
led police to a Texas drifter, Richard Ramirez. Convicted of 13 murders but 
defiant to the end, Ramirez was sentenced to death four years later in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
INFERNO: 
</P>
<P>
A tree swaying in a severe Santa Ana wind brushed a power line. The resulting 
fire gutted an entire section of Anaheim. The epic blaze destroyed 50 buildings 
containing 525 apartments and turned 1,200 people into instant homeless. The 
damage was estimated at $50 million. Miraculously, no one was seriously injured 
(1982). 
</P>
<P>
INFERNO II: 
</P>
<P>
Six months after the Anaheim conflagration, a brush fire erupted in Gypsum 
Canyon behind Orange and spread to the nearby, very pricey Crest de Ville 
community. Twelve homes were leveled there and three others nearby (1982). 
</P>
<P>
TERRORISM AT HOME: 
</P>
<P>
Alex M. Odeh, 41, regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Defamation 
Committee, opened his office door in Santa Ana and was fatally injured by a 
bomb. The FBI's suspicions fell on members of the Jewish Defense League, but no 
arrests have been made (1985). 
</P>
<P>
FERTILITY RECORD: 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Frustaci checked into St. Joseph Hospital in Orange and delivered the 
first septuplets in U.S. history. Although just three survived, the Frustacis 
said they were blessed and returned to Riverside. After the worldwide hoopla 
subsided, they sued the doctor who had administered fertility drugs (1984). 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN AS PREY: 
</P>
<P>
It's called Caspers Wilderness Park, but no one took that literally until a 
young mountain lion sprang from the brush and carried away 5-year-old Laura 
Small. Laura, rescued almost immediately, was left partially paralyzed and 
blind in one eye. Seven months later, Justin Mellon, 6, was similarly attacked. 
The park was closed and a hunt begun. When the park reopened three months 
later, visitors were warned to stay with their children (1986). 
</P>
<P>
SURF RIOT: 
</P>
<P>
There were 100,000 people on the beach the final day of the Ocean Pacific Pro 
Surfing Championships in Huntington Beach when a group of beach-goers behind 
the grandstand became rowdy, then violent. Soon a full-scale riot was under 
way. By darkness, riot police had cleared the beach, but not before several 
police and lifeguard vehicles had been burned, more than 40 people injured and 
13 people arrested (1986). 
</P>
<P>
OLYMPIC FEVER: 
</P>
<P>
Lots of the excitement and some of the pageantry of the Los Angeles Olympics 
spilled over into Orange County. The biggest happening: bicycle races through 
Mission Viejo (1984). 
</P>
<P>
MISSING CHILD: 
</P>
<P>
Three-year-old Laura Bradbury of Huntington Beach disappeared from the family 
campsite at Joshua Tree National Monument, apparently a kidnap victim, touching 
off what grew into a nationwide search captained by her father (1984). Five 
years later, her family continued to deny the possibility of her death despite 
DNA tests showing bone fragments found near the campsite "were consistent with 
Laura Bradbury". 
</P>
<P>
MURDER MYSTERY: 
</P>
<P>
Edward Lee Cooperman, a Cal State Fullerton physicist, was found shot to death 
in his office. But why? A student, Vietnamese immigrant Minh Van Lam, said it 
had been an accident. Cooperman's friends said it had been an assassination 
prompted by Cooperman's humanitarian and scientific aid to Communist Vietnam. 
The judge scoffed at the assassination theory and convicted Lam of involuntary 
manslaughter (1984). 
</P>
<P>
MONEYGATE: 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, based in Irvine, spent five years on the financial 
fast track of junk bonds and high-risk real estate before federal regulators 
took it over (1989) and calculated that it could cost taxpayers $2 billion to 
bail it out. After Lincoln's collapse, Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of 
Lincoln's parent company, found himself the subject of congressional, civil and 
criminal investigations. Joining him on the hot seat were politicians whose 
favor he had cultivated -- including U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston of California. 
</P>
<P>
MUNIGATE: 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest judicial investigations in California focused on Harbor 
Municipal Court in Newport Beach, where six judges came under scrutiny (1989). 
In the end, Judge Brian R. Carter, suspected of exchanging courtroom favors for 
sex, retired rather than undergo a formal disciplinary hearing. Evidence 
included a taped conversation between Carter and a prostitute in which he 
stated, "This is the one you owe me." And Judge Calvin P. Schmidt was publicly 
rebuked for giving preferential treatment to a friend's daughter and making 
improper campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
GATESGATE: 
</P>
<P>
A jury heard weeks of allegations that Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates had 
used his investigators to harass political opponents by tape-recording their 
conversations and trumping up charges against them. Their verdict: Gates must 
pay $189,894 to the private investigator who filed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
SECOND THOUGHTS: 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon Brown, 14, confessed to murdering her stepmother and was sentenced to 
prison (1985). Case closed? Not quite. After three years in stir, she conceded 
to investigators that she had taken the rap for her father out of "love and 
loyalty." Officers arrested David Arnold Brown, an Anaheim Hills businessman, 
who they said took out $835,000 in life insurance on his wife, persuaded his 
daughter to confess to the murder, then married his dead wife's sister. Later, 
more charges were filed against Brown: trying, while in jail, to hire the 
murders of key prosecution figures. David Brown's trial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
TRAGIC MISTAKE II: 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Jean Ernst, 27, said she wanted only to lie down and asked her 
boyfriend to watch her 3-month-old twins napping outside in a car in Garden 
Grove. But by the time she checked on them five hours later, they were dead 
from the summer heat, estimated to have reached 120 degrees inside the car. 
Tried for involuntary manslaughter, she was convicted of child endangerment and 
sentenced to four years in prison. "It's not fair," she said to her attorney 
(1986). 
</P>
<P>
TRAGIC MISTAKE III: 
</P>
<P>
A Costa Mesa police helicopter, helping to pursue a suspect, passed the chase 
to a Newport Beach police helicopter as the suspect's car crossed over the city 
limit. But within seconds, the two helicopters collided and crashed. All three 
people aboard the Costa Mesa craft were killed. Miraculously, the two Newport 
officers survived (1987). 
</P>
<P>
DEADLY CLOUD: 
</P>
<P>
About 7,500 people fled their homes and jobs when an arsonist touched off a 
fire in an Anaheim pesticides and fertilizer warehouse (1985). More than 80 
chemicals, some of them lethal, were released over sections of Anaheim, 
Fullerton and Placentia. Only emergency workers were allowed in the area for 
four days. The owner of the warehouse, the Larry Fricker Co., later agreed to 
pay $200,000 for the cleanup. More than 300 claims were filed, alleging lost 
work time, respiratory infections and burdensome hotel, food and medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
HOME, v.EET HOME: 
</P>
<P>
The cost of houses, which began to spiral up in the '70s, went through the roof 
in the '80s. The average price of a house was about $150,000 at the start of 
the decade and was flirting with $400,000 at the end. 
</P>
<P>
NEAREST MISS: 
</P>
<P>
At John Wayne Airport, Air California Flight 336 tried to land on the runway 
where Air California Flight 931 was taking off, forcing 336's pilot to belly-in 
his Boeing 737 at the last second. The plane was mangled, but of the 104 
aboard, just 33 were injured, and no one was killed (1981). 
</P>
<P>
CHANGING FACE: 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 census put the county's minority population at about 22%, but a 
decade-long migration of Mexicans, Vietnamese and El Salvadorans raised the 
figure to an estimated 27%, and still climbing. 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC: 
</P>
<P>
It was a problem in 1980. It was a bigger problem in 1989. With two 
transportation taxes defeated, population still growing and cars still 
everyone's favorite wheels, there was no solution in sight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newsmakers 
</P>
<P>
John Paul Bostrom, 13 months, and Eugenie Wilhelmina Bostrom, 2 weeks, went in 
for a medical checkup, the first step in events that eventually blew their 
secret: They were the out-of-wedlock children of family man and right-wing 
moralist John G. Schmitz, 51, once a congressman but then state senator from 
Corona del Mar. Their mother, Swedish-born Carla Stuckle, 43, had been one of 
Schmitz's students at Santa Ana College and a Republican volunteer. Stuckle 
said that Schmitz, married 28 years with seven children, eventually offered to 
pay $200 a month in child support but told her he couldn't pay more and still 
maintain his wife's life style (1981). 
</P>
<P>
Andrija Artukovic, frail from 85 years of living, was seized at his home in 
Surfside and ordered sent to Yugoslavia, becoming the highest-ranking Nazi war 
criminal ever extradited from the United States (1985). The Yugoslavs said that 
while Nazi interior minister of Croatia, Artukovic ordered entire town and 
village populations executed. Before a firing squad could carry out his 
sentence, Artukovic died of old age in a prison in Yugoslavia (1988). 
</P>
<P>
Mel C. Yorba, 17, of Riverside, became Disneyland's first murder victim (1981). 
</P>
<P>
W. Patrick Moriarty, an Anaheim fireworks manufacturer determined to prevent 
anti-fireworks laws, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to influence 
legislation. He wound up indicted and pleading guilty to bribing government 
officials and giving kickbacks to bankers (1985). Called one of the most 
significant political corruption cases in recent California history, the 
Moriarty affair led to indictment of city council members, bankers and one 
state legislator. 
</P>
<P>
David P. Jacobsen of Huntington Beach, a hospital administrator held hostage in 
Lebanon for 17 months, returned home to an outpouring of welcomes and 
patriotism. Released after U.S. arms shipments to Iran, Jacobsen praised Lt. 
Col. Oliver L. North as a hero, criticized news media probing of the 
transaction and at the White House tried to protect President Reagan from 
hostile questions by ordering reporters to "back off" (1986). 
</P>
<P>
Father Lawrence Jenco was also released by Lebanese terrorists after 19 months 
in captivity and was assigned by the Catholic Church to temporary duty in 
Orange County (1986). Asked what he thought of the arms shipment that freed 
him, the priest said: "I can't comprehend why we have to ship arms and kill 
innocent men, women and children. It doesn't make sense to me. . . . I would 
have said, 'No, I will stay.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sheryl Lynn Massip repeatedly tried to kill her 6-week-old son and finally 
succeeded by running over him with the family Volvo. Her attorneys said she 
suffered from postpartum psychosis, a rare maternal disorder that causes severe 
anxiety, delusions and sometimes violence. A jury convicted her of 
second-degree murder (1988), but the trial judge overturned the verdict. "I 
didn't have any choice but to find her insane," Superior Court Judge Robert R. 
Fitzgerald said. "She was bonkers." 
</P>
<P>
Wally, the 5 1/2-foot alligator who had lived in Upper Newport Bay for at least 
three years, was finally caught on a street in Irvine, much to the relief of 
local water birds. Too small for a zoo, Wally was sent to live in a 
herpetologist's private pond (1985). 
</P>
<P>
Roger R. Stanton, a Fountain Valley city councilman, launched an impossibly 
low-budget campaign against incumbent county supervisor Philip L. Anthony 
(1980) -- and won, apparently buoyed by Anthony's indictment for laundering 
campaign money. By decade's end, Stanton still firmly held the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Razo Jr., 21 -- pride of the La Habra barrio, fund-raiser for cancer 
victims, Boys Club leader, youth award winner, star high school scholar and 
athlete, scholarship winner, above-average student and linebacker at Harvard -- 
</P>
<P>
was also La Habra's Ski Mask Bandit. Razo confessed (1987) to a string of armed 
robberies during vacation breaks from Harvard, saying "I'm a home boy now. At 
Harvard, I didn't fit in." He later recanted his confession but was convicted 
and sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Waisanen, former aide to TV evangelist Robert H. Schuller, blew the 
whistle on his old boss, revealing that fund-raising letters and photographs 
supposedly made during Schuller's trip to China had been faked months before 
Schuller departed. Schuller refused to comment, but his public relations 
spokesman, oblivious to the pun, called mailing the letters "a clerical error" 
(1987). 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Northwood Little League All-Stars, winning 18 straight playoff games 
-- 12 of them by shutouts -- became the national champion and America's hope of 
dislodging powerhouse Taiwan at the 1987 Little League World Series. Final 
score: Taiwan, 21, Northwood 1 -- the worst shellacking in the series' history. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the North Irvine Bobby Sox Minors won their second straight 
national softball championship (1987). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oddities 
</P>
<P>
HEY, YOU TWO: 
</P>
<P>
A gay couple were tossed out of Disneyland after caught dancing together on a 
dance floor (1980). The men filed suit, and five years later Disneyland quietly 
dropped its no-same-sex dancing rule. 
</P>
<P>
UP AGAINST THE WALL, BEAR: 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland's Winnie the Pooh was hauled into Superior Court by parents of a 
9-year-old girl who said Pooh had slugged their daughter at the park, causing 
$100,000 worth of bruises and headaches. In full costume, Winnie demonstrated 
that it had been an accident, nothing more than a smack from an ear when Pooh 
turned around. The jury deliberated 21 minutes and found the bear innocent 
(1980). 
</P>
<P>
UP AGAINST THE WALL, YOUR HONOR, WHENEVER IT'S CONVENIENT: 
</P>
<P>
Former Irvine Mayor Art Anthony beat his wife and nicked her with a bullet from 
a .45-caliber automatic pistol, sending her fleeing to the home of Police Chief 
Leo Peart. Peart, taking charge of the case, decided to let Anthony stay home 
that night, visited him twice the next day, allowed him to voluntarily check in 
to a psychiatric hospital and did not attempt an arrest for almost two days. 
Peart said later that moving too fast might have provoked a shoot-out (1981). 
</P>
<P>
THEY WHAT? 
</P>
<P>
The Angels won their division, then blew a two-game lead in the playoffs 
(1982). 
</P>
<P>
THEY W-H-A-T? 
</P>
<P>
The Angels won their division, then blew a two-game lead in the playoffs 
(1986). 
</P>
<P>
FOR ONE THING, THE RENT'S LOWER: 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Streleski, a Stanford mathematician who beat a professor to death with 
a hammer, chose to remain in prison rather than be paroled to Orange County. "I 
have nothing against Orange County," he said. "I understand it's got the best 
solid tax base in the state. But it's not my place." 
</P>
<P>
FREEWAY FEEDING FRENZY: 
</P>
<P>
Bank robbers fleeing police tossed cash onto the Costa Mesa Freeway, touching 
off a scramble among motorists. Police caught up to the pair but found $1,200 
of the loot missing (1985). 
</P>
<P>
GOOD CITIZEN AWARD: 
</P>
<P>
Deanna Young, 13, fresh from a lecture at church against drug abuse, turned in 
her parents to Tustin police for possessing about an ounce of cocaine and a 
small amount of marijuana (1986). Her parents, a bartender and a federal court 
clerk, later said they were proud of Deanna. Deanna said, "I'd do it again." 
</P>
<P>
KING OF THE JAILBIRDS: 
</P>
<P>
Willie Ray Wisely, convicted murderer and jailhouse lawyer supreme, set the 
record for longest stay in Orange County Jail -- more than seven years. Because 
he acted as his own attorney, he was provided with a private double cell, law 
books, a personal computer, a TV set, a telephone and a wife. (He secretly 
married his court-appointed law clerk during a jail visit.) Wisely was finally 
sent to Folsom Prison (1988) but continues to file motions occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
POLLGATE: 
</P>
<P>
Afraid that the Democrats would cheat, the Republicans got in the first punch. 
Blaming rumors that Democrats would truck illegal aliens to the polls, county 
Republican Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes approved stationing uniformed security 
guards at polls in 20 mostly Latino precincts of Santa Ana (1988). County 
officials ordered them away and local Latinos filed lawsuits, but the 
Republican candidate, Curt Pringle, narrowly won his seat in Congress, and no 
one was charged. Eventually a bill was passed in Sacramento making uniformed or 
armed guards at the polls a felony, and local Republicans paid $400,000 to 
settle the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
WAIT, LET ME EXPLAIN: 
</P>
<P>
Irvine applied for federal funds to convert an animal shelter into housing for 
the homeless (1987). (The feds later withdrew their grant because planes taking 
off from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station came too close to the site.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hello... 
</P>
<P>
To car-pool lanes, appearing on the Costa Mesa Freeway (1985), spreading to the 
San Diego Freeway (1989) and prompting smiles or rage, depending on whether you 
were in one. 
</P>
<P>
To the Orange County Performing Arts Center, nurtured by land and money 
donations from C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons. Its opening (1986) ushered Orange 
County into the cultural big leagues, according to its promoters. 
</P>
<P>
To Rudy Castruita, who grew up in a Spanish-speaking home in El Monte, earned a 
doctorate at USC and became the first Latino superintendent of the Santa Ana 
Unified School District, the biggest in Orange County and eighth-largest in the 
state (1988). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goodby... 
</P>
<P>
To Edison Miller, Edmund G. Brown Jr., appointee to the Board of Supervisors, 
whose anti-war statements while a Vietnam POW made him anathema to 
conservatives. He was easily swept off the Board of Supervisors by Reagan 
Republican Bruce Nestande (1980). 
</P>
<P>
To the California Surf, who proved that Orange County wasn't ready for 
professional soccer (1981). 
</P>
<P>
To Richard Nixon, who moved out of San Clemente and became a New Yorker (1980). 
</P>
<P>
To John Briggs, Republican state senator from Fullerton for 15 years, who 
resigned with three years left in his term. He was bored, he said (1981). 
</P>
<P>
To Walter Knott, Orange County's most famous berry farmer, who died at age 91 
(1981). 
</P>
<P>
To James Myford Irvine, great-grandson of 19th-Century land baron James Irvine. 
He moved to Hawaii (1981). 
</P>
<P>
To Orange County International Raceway, the last drag strip in Southern 
California, lost to a business park development (1983). 
</P>
<P>
To affordable housing. Bowing to pressure from developers, the county 
supervisors scuttled its 5-year-old program that required builders to produce 
some lower-cost homes (1983). 
</P>
<P>
To C. David Baker's political career. So intent on bankrolling his campaign for 
a Republican congressional nomination, he forged the name of a Superior Court 
judge to a check and got caught (1988). 
</P>
<P>
To Ralph A. Diedrich, one-time baron of the Board of Supervisors. Imprisoned 
for bribery, defiant to the end, he died in San Diego (1988). 
</P>
<P>
To 44-year-old, barnstorming Meadowlark Airport in Huntington Beach, the last 
privately run airport in the Los Angeles and Orange County area (1989). Its 
successor: a shopping center and housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goodby Again (and Again and Again)... 
</P>
<P>
To the Huntington Beach Pier. A hurricane removed its end (1939), then winter 
storm waves did the same (1983 and 1988). As the '90s approached, Huntington 
Beach closed the remainder of the pier and announced plans to rebuild the whole 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
To the husbands of Georgia Frontiere, owner of the Rams. In the '80s, she 
married, then divorced musician/composer/convicted tax evader Dominic 
Frontiere, her seventh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hello and Goodby... 
</P>
<P>
To drug guru Timothy Leary. Hired to be host for a talk show on KEZY radio in 
Anaheim, he was fired within a week (1980). 
</P>
<P>
To trauma centers. Five opened and were praised for saving the most critically 
injured patients (1980), but high costs began thinning their ranks. Two are 
gone, and the future of the remaining three could be tenuous. 
</P>

To the scourge of fruit growers, the Mediterranean fruit fly. The first one, a

To Guy Snyder, 41, a Las Vegas hotel worker, who said he would sail round the 
world in 242 days and smash all sorts of records. He, his wife and his mother

days later made a U-turn for home, victims of seasickness (1980).

To the Gay and Lesbian Student Education Union at Fullerton College. Rather 
than be forced by court order to recognize the group, the Board of Trustees 
withdrew recognition from all campus clubs (1980). The decision still stands, 
but G&amp;L eventually got onto campus by obtaining student government approval 
(1988). 
</P>
<P>
To Richard L. Fluharty, Eleazar Gonzales, Ly Hung, Michael D. Taylor and Steven 
Wilson, who checked out of Orange County Jail by rappelling four stories using 
a rope of knotted bedsheets (1988). One got no farther than a jail roof, one 
surrendered, two made it to Denver, and Taylor got as far as Chicago, where 
authorities believe he stuck up a jewelry store for $450,000 in loose gems. 
Within eight months, all were back in the slammer.

<P>
Hello and Shut up...

To the Pacific Amphitheatre, which opened to the cheers of audiences and the 
howls of neighbors (1983). The neighborhood took its complaint about concert 
noise to court, where it remained unresolved as the decade ended.

STREET SMART: A TICKLISH ROUTE FROM DISNEYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
For years there has been a major problem experienced by Disneyland visitors who 
wish to go north on the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
After exiting the park and proceeding north on West Street, they must turn 
right onto Ball Road, then work their way over to the left-hand lanes so that, 
once they've crossed the freeway, they can make a left turn across the 
westbound lanes and onto the freeway entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is building a new bridge where Ball Road crosses the freeway. It is my 
understanding that when this new bridge is completed, Disneyland visitors will 
still have to work their way over to the left lanes on this new bridge so they 
can make a left turn across traffic on Ball Road to reach the freeway entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone spend millions of dollars on a new bridge without making 
provision to safely handle the many cars traveling east on Ball Road that would 
like to enter the northbound Santa Ana Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
Richard C. Martin 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
That freeway entrance is a doozy, the kind that makes motorists wish they were 
safely back on the Autopia in the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
But officials at Caltrans have a ready explanation for why they won't be 
eliminating the troublesome left turn on Ball Road. 
</P>
<P>
Given their druthers, the agency's highway engineers admit they would like to 
install a cloverleaf-type freeway entrance that would siphon eastbound traffic 
off Ball Road's right-hand lane and swing it on a curving strip of asphalt down 
onto the northbound Santa Ana Freeway. No muss, no fuss and no left-hand turn. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the land needed for such a serpentine freeway ramp is occupied 
by a motel. Caltrans officials say the agency cannot justify purchasing the 
property and removing the motel just for a new freeway ramp. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they plan to do the next best thing. As part of the bridge 
construction, Caltrans will erect a new left-turn signal and add an extra 
left-turn lane off Ball Road onto the northbound Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the new turn lanes and traffic light, which will be 
synchronized with signals on nearby Harbor Boulevard, will help all those 
Mouseketeer groupies and Tinkerbell fans get onto the freeway a whole lot 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Like everyone in the Los Angeles Basin, I have become increasingly concerned 
with our traffic problems. The only solutions I see being offered appear to 
involve large sums of money and long-term projects. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. The obvious 
answer is car-pooling. Unfortunately, most people give up on the idea because 
of the hassles involved in coordinating everyone. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see local newspapers run advertising at no charge to commuters 
listing where people live and work, using the coordinates from a Thomas 
Brothers map book. This would provide a quick reference for people who live and 
work near one another and who have similar work schedules to form a car pool. 
</P>
<P>
Many large companies use a similar system for their employees. I am suggesting 
that this could be tried on an areawide basis. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written about the number of single-driver vehicles on the 
freeways. I think this plan could be a very logical way to reduce that number 
and speed up traffic on our freeway system, and it could be done with the least 
cost to the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas C. Moore 
</P>
<P>
Orange 
</P>
<P>
It's nice to see someone thinking about promoting car-pooling, which many 
transportation experts say is an important weapon in the battle to ease traffic 
congestion in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Those same experts, however, say that putting together such a commuter bulletin 
board in local newspapers might prove ineffective, since many residents are 
squeamish about public listings of their addresses and phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there is already a program to serve this purpose. It is called Commuter 
Computer, and it offers motorists information about others who live and work 
near them in an effort to encourage the formation of car pools. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested can call Commuter Computer at (714) 636-RIDE for information 
on car pools, van pools and the nearest park-and-ride lot. 
</P>
<P>
A very valid point. Seat belts save lives. Just ask any CHP officer or 
ambulance driver. Street Smart encourages motorists to use them, even if they 
sometime wrinkle your tie or blouse.

HOMICIDES SET RECORD IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From a 4-year-old boy slain in a hail of gang gunfire to a topless bar owner 
ambushed inside his limousine, a record number of people became homicide 
victims in Orange County during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The 155 killings recorded for the year by the Orange County coroner's office up 
to New Year's Eve, far surpassed the previous record of 131 homicides set in 
1985. The 1989 total easily topped the 129 slayings in 1988, 98 in 1987 and 112 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials studying the grim statistics say they cannot pinpoint 
any specific causes for the nearly 18% rise in the number of people who died at 
the hands of others in 1989. They can only note a general increase in violence 
in society and evidence that a growing number of people carry guns. 
</P>
<P>
"Homicides are just one of those things (for which) there are no explanations," 
Garden Grove Lt. Chuck Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly it is difficult to find a satisfying explanation for the death of 
4-year-old Frank Fernandez Jr., caught in the gang cross-fire in September as 
he stood in his family's driveway in Garden Grove. Or for the kidnap and murder 
of 9-year-old Nadia Puente of Santa Ana in March. Or for the slaying of 
12-year-old Jacalyn Calabrese, who was shot and killed in the Mall of Orange 
last month as a schoolmate showed off his .25-caliber pistol. 
</P>
<P>
While many of last year's murders seem particularly senseless, others were 
carried out with the precision of a gangland murder. 
</P>
<P>
Horace Joseph McKenna -- known as "Big Mac" -- was shot through the rear 
passenger window of his limousine as it pulled up to the gate of his expansive 
estate in Brea's Carbon Canyon. McKenna, a former California Highway Patrol 
officer and a 6-foot, 6-inch bodybuilder, was under investigation for hidden 
ownership in several nude and topless bars at the time of his death. No arrests 
have been made. 
</P>
<P>
While no tally was available for each city, Anaheim appeared to have posted one 
of the largest increases in homicides. There were 28 killings in 1989, an 
increase of 10 over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy said that little changed in his city last year in 
terms of the provocation for homicide. Fights between family members and 
drunken brawls were again the most common situations that led to homicide in 
the county's most populous city. 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of the homicides we're investigating, the victim and suspect knew 
each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For all the concern and publicity about drugs and gangs, only four of the 
killings appeared to be directly linked to the narcotics trade, he said. And 
echoing the comments of police officials in other cities, Molloy added that 
gang activity accounts for relatively few killings around the county. 
</P>
<P>
While Anaheim, the Sheriff's Department and Santa Ana report an upswing in 
homicides, Garden Grove actually experienced a reduction. Gibbs said the city 
had four fewer homicides in 1989, recording eight as the year drew to a close. 
</P>
<P>
But just as no one has a good answer for why the county's homicide rate surged 
last year, Gibbs is at a loss to explain the good news in his city. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been real fortunate," Gibbs said. "I don't know why. (There's) no way to 
track this stuff or predict it."

NUN WHO HELPED POOR IS DEAD AT 81 
</P>

<P>
Sister Henrietta Sauvageau, who spent more than 60 years ministering to the 
poor, the homeless, the addicted and the deaf in Orange County, has died at age 
81. 
</P>
<P>
Her fellow Sisters of St. Joseph described her as an irrepressible person to 
whom it was nearly impossible to say no. She had a knack for organizing and 
would go to great lengths to help anybody in need, other nuns said. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to say, 'I'm not going to go out with you any more, Sister Henrietta; 
you're a perfect beggar,' " recalled Sister Angela Lemay, 85, a friend from 
childhood. "But it was always for the poor, never for herself." 
</P>
<P>
Once Sister Henrietta learned that St. Joseph Hospital had purchased new 
mattresses, and she resolved to give the old ones to poor families. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'But how are you going to move the mattresses?' " Sister Angela said. 
"She said, 'Never you mind.' There was a circus in town, and somehow she got 
the men to help her." The mattresses were indeed delivered -- in a circus van. 
</P>
<P>
"She would get anything and everything from anybody," Sister Angela said. "You 
couldn't say no to Henrietta." 
</P>
<P>
Born Mathilde Sauvageau in 1908 in Manchester, N.H., she went to work in a shoe 
factory after completing the eighth grade. According to Sister Angela, who 
worked in the same factory, she gave most of her earnings to a local religious 
order, and on Saturday nights persuaded her friend to come with her to an 
orphanage, where they would put little girls' hair up for Sunday curls. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, she suffered from polio, and once confided that she had been told 
by a doctor that she would not walk again, Sister Rose Marie Redding said. "She 
said, 'Oh, yes I will. If God wills it, I will walk again.' She promised God: 
'I won't complain about my legs if I can walk again.' And even when her legs 
hurt her, she never did complain." 
</P>
<P>
After hearing about nuns who were ministering to homeless immigrants in Los 
Angeles, she came west and entered the Sisters of St. Joseph convent in Orange 
in 1927, taking her final vows in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Henrietta taught school in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego for 
about 15 years, and was stationed permanently in Orange in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
She began a home for women with alcohol or chemical dependency and founded 
programs for the hearing-impaired, Sister Rose Marie said. And in 1975, she 
volunteered to help the first Vietnamese refugees who arrived after the fall of 
Saigon and were sent to Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
For the past few years she had suffered from diabetes and had difficulty 
walking, but she got around in an electric cart, and "never missed a party," 
Sister Rose Marie said. Sister Henrietta continued to visit women in the 
dependency program until she suffered a stroke in early November. She died 
Saturday of kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Henrietta is survived by an older sister, Bertha Marston, who lives in 
the convent's infirmary, and by a stepsister, nieces, nephews and cousins. 
</P>
<P>
A Rosary prayer service will be held at 5 p.m. Thursday, followed by a Mass of 
the Resurrection at 7 p.m. in the Motherhouse Chapel, 480 S. Batavia St., 
Orange. Burial services will be at 9 a.m. Friday in the chapel, with burial in 
Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Orange.

RAMS PUT THEIR FOUL-WEATHER REPUTATION ON ICE WITH VICTORY

<P>
The cold, rainy weather for Sunday's wild-card game was supposed to favor the 
Eagles, who are accustomed to playing on the 100-yard slip-and-slide that is 
the Veterans Stadium artificial turf in a downpour. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the Eagles, not the Rams, who couldn't hang onto the football. The 
Rams fumbled once. Philadelphia fumbled six times. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams hope this will help put an end to their reputation as fair-weather 
football players. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could get (cornerback) Darryl Henley out from in front of the heater, 
we'd be all right," linebacker Mel Owens said. "He's the only guy who sits in 
front of the heater. 
</P>
<P>
"But, really, I'm from Michigan and believe me, nobody gets used to cold and 
rain. Nobody. I don't care who you are. Not even the birds. They seek shelter 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same for both teams. You put on a little sweat shirt and a little 
glove and you play football." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Kevin Greene was a little more succinct in his appraisal of the 
Rams' cold-weather rap. 
</P>
<P>
"Can the beach boys play in cold weather?" he asked, rather loudly, of the 
media mob crowded around his locker. "Well, can the beach boys play in cold 
weather?" he asked again, even louder. 
</P>
<P>
A number of reporters mumbled something akin to "yes," and Greene seemed 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams also hope they have dispelled another popular notion: that a team with 
a defense ranked 21st in the league has no business being in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the lowest-ranking defense in the playoffs and a lot of people said we 
didn't deserve to be here," linebacker Mike Wilcher said. "That gave us a lot 
of incentive today." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Greene took a more emotional tact on that subject. 
</P>
<P>
"Stiff all that, man," he said. "Play with your heart. It was a question of 
will today and we maintained that mentality. We had the desire and we kept 
fighting. And we had no lulls in the whole 15 rounds."

FIRING BACK AT EX-EMPLOYER; 
</P>
<P>
ATTORNEY DISCUSSES LAWSUITS OVER WRONGFUL TERMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gregory Crouch, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Bott, 55, of San Clemente claimed he was terminated from his 17-year job 
as Santa Ana's director of personnel in 1983 because of his age and his efforts 
to expose wrongdoing in city hiring. Six months ago, a jury decided it didn't 
believe him. But last week, Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein said he did 
and overturned the jury's verdict, awarding Bott $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is a good example of the difficulties involved in proving a wrongful 
termination lawsuit. Courts and legislatures are providing an increasing amount 
of protection for employees from indiscriminate firings but many of the laws 
are complicated. Nearly all require anybody terminated to act quickly if he or 
she hopes to win a verdict against a former employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin attorney Harris E. Kershnar has represented more than 100 individuals 
who have sued their former employers for wrongful termination. He spent the 
early part of his career defending employers from such suits but changed sides 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm philosophically more comfortable representing the underdog," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kershnar, 36, now serves on the American Bar Assn.'s Equal Employment 
Opportunity Committee and is a former chairman of the labor law section of the 
Orange County Bar Assn. He graduated from the law school at UC Berkeley. He 
recently spoke with Times staff writer Gregory Crouch about how fired employees 
can vindicate themselves in court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. What types of wrongful termination cases have you typically argued? 
</P>
<P>
A. They are a varied lot. One was a case involving a large oil company that 
conducted searches of employees' vehicles and lockers as well as the employees 
themselves. The employee I represented was discharged because a marijuana 
cigarette was found in his car. The jury reached a verdict in favor of the 
employee on the grounds the employer violated an expressed agreement not to 
discharge people without good cause. Plus, there was an inadequate showing that 
the marijuana was his. And there wasn't much in the way of precedent to 
establish that drugs found inside a car amounted to grounds for terminating 
someone when there was no indication he had ever used drugs at work or ever 
reported to work under the influence of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
On a different subject altogether, I handled an age discrimination case against 
a trucking company where there was a manager who thought my client was too old 
to be a driver and didn't hesitate to communicate that in front of other 
employees. My client was fired for a minor driving accident, which would not 
have typically resulted in the termination of a driver. The case was settled on 
terms we thought were quite favorable. And I had a case where an employee was 
fired for refusing to fire somebody else who declined to take a lie detector 
test. It's illegal to require someone to take a lie detector test, and my 
client was told to fire an employee who exercised his right to decline such a 
test. My client told the president of the company it was illegal for him to 
fire this person and, in turn, my client was fired. My client won a verdict on 
the basis his firing was contrary to the public policy of the state of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How common is it for somebody to get fired? 
</P>
<P>
A. Exceedingly common. People who feel they have been improperly terminated 
call up virtually on a daily basis. Nearly everyone who is fired feels that it 
was improper or unfair, but the real question is how many have a legal remedy, 
because what's unfair does not equal what is unlawful. I don't have a 
percentage for you, but a small percent of the unfair terminations fall into 
categories where the law provides a remedy. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So what are the different categories? 
</P>
<P>
A. The primary area is in civil rights laws covering age, race, sex, religion, 
national origin and physical handicap. Firings based upon any of those 
categories is prohibited based upon the Fair Employment and Housing Act, which 
is a California statute. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is 
not prohibited by the terms of the acts but there are serval cities that have 
municipal ordinances that prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians, 
including Laguna Beach, Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What if the reason for somebody's dismissal doesn't coincide with one of the 
civil rights classifications? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are a number of individual pigeonholes. It's illegal to fire someone 
because they have brought a wage claim before the labor commission. It's 
illegal to fire an employee for disclosing his wages to a fellow employee. You 
cannot be fired for reporting to state or federal authorities any illegalities 
that you plausibly believe are occuring at your employer. For example, if you 
think your employer is violating environmental laws by dumping petroleum 
products into sewers instead of disposing of them in a proper manner and your 
employer fired you for blowing the whistle on them, that would be unlawful. If 
you are fired because you attempt to organize a union, that is unlawful under 
the National Labor Relations Act. If you are fired by the company to try and 
deprive you of your pension, that is prohibited under the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act. Finally, if you are fired because you performed jury 
service when summoned, that is unlawful. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What if you were simply fired without warning or good cause? 
</P>
<P>
A. The category most people fall under is that involving an expressed or 
implied employment contract which limits the employer's right to terminate. For 
instance, if an employer has a progressive discipline policy requiring warnings 
or other procedures prior to termination but does not follow that, an employee 
can bring a contract-based action for improper termination. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How can an employee find out whether his or her company has such a policy? 
</P>
<P>
A. Many employers issue employee handbooks which would contain such a policy. 
And if you're a supervisor you have probably received instruction from your 
employer as to the discipline of employees. If a policy is not in your employee 
handbook, ask your supervisor or the personnel department. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Besides what's contained in the employee handbook, are there other things a 
company does that imply a contractual relationship? 
</P>
<P>
A. Aside from written policy there is also the issue of actual practice. Even 
if there is not a piece of paper that says a company will follow progressive 
discipline but the way the employer disciplines employees amounts to a practice 
of progressive discipline, then employees are entitled to be treated in the 
same manner. There is an aspect of what's called the implied covenant of good 
faith and fair dealing which holds that like cases should be treated alike. For 
example, if employees who are tardy or absent are normally cautioned at least 
two times before being fired and a prospective client walks into my office and 
says he was absent once and was fired for that absence and there had been no 
other infractions committed by him, the employer would not be treating like 
cases alike. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about performance appraisals? 
</P>
<P>
A. Verbal and written communications by superiors are important. For example, 
if your boss told you that you had a bright future with the company and you 
bypass opportunities elsewhere, that would strengthen the claim for you based 
on an implied contract. Make sure performance appraisals are done because they 
will document whether you are or are not doing a good job and that is another 
factor looked at in implied contract cases. If you have a series of favorable 
evaluations and then all of a sudden you are told your performance warrants 
termination, that is not going to carry the day unless they can show some very 
specific misdeeds on the employee's part. The handbook, appraisals and length 
of service are all building blocks of an implied contract. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should an employee ask to see his personnel file if he smells trouble? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Every employee in California has a statutory right to inspect his 
personnel file and ought to exercise that right so the employee knows whether 
he or she has been written up. The employee should send a written response to 
the head of the personnel department and ask that a copy be placed in his 
personnel file while the incident is fresh in his mind and he has an 
opportunity to clear it up. Because employees come and go, it might be 
important for the employee to speak to other employees at the time this occurs 
because other employees' input may be critical to substantiating the employee's 
version of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there some firings that cannot be challenged in court? 
</P>
<P>
A. If an employee was truly what is called "at will," that employee can be let 
go for no reason. Someone who is an at-will employee doesn't have a contract, 
implied or expressed. The United States is very unusual in that regard among 
Western nations. In Western Europe there typically must be some legitimate 
basis for termination. Otherwise, employees can obtain some monetary 
compensation. But in California, if an employee is truly at will and doesn't 
fall into any of the pigeonholes of the civil rights laws or specific statutory 
prohibitions, he can be fired because the employer wakes up on the wrong side 
of the bed. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are at-will firings common? 
</P>
<P>
A. I screen out many more cases than I accept because the circumstance don't 
seem to be such that the law will provide a remedy. There are many times when 
people describe circumstances which strike me as unfair but they don't have any 
legal recourse. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How soon must a fired employee decide whether he will sue? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's important for individuals to act in a timely manner because even if you 
fall into a category where the law would permit relief, if you wait too long 
you lose your rights. The time frames for each statute vary but an employee 
should never let a full year lapse before proceeding against an employer. 
Ideally, you should act more promptly than that, while witnesses are available 
and recollections are fresh. Employment cases are almost always hard-fought. 
And employers typically have much greater resources than individuals. The 
typical plaintiff is by definition unemployed and suffering disastrous 
financial consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can an employee with a medical condition be fired? 
</P>
<P>
A. When employees have been on a substantial medical leave because of a 
non-work-related condition which does not amount to a physical handicap, they 
can be fired. The man in the street feels it's grossly unfair, yet there is 
nothing unlawful about it. Take somebody who was seriously injured but not 
crippled in an automobile accident that wasn't work-related. The person is not 
considered handicapped in the strictest sense of the law because they don't 
have a permanent disabling condition. The employer might say you are fired 
because it won't wait until you are ready to come back and the employee has no 
recourse. The person may be entitled to state disability insurance but that 
doesn't force the employer to retain the employee. Those two are not tied 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much is the fired employee going to have to spend on legal fees? 
</P>
<P>
A. Typically employment attorneys, including me, handle cases on a contingency 
basis. And that's another reason why it's important for plaintiff practitioners 
to carefully evaluate cases. You can't make a living unless you win a fair 
percentage of the time. If there is a valid claim, I'm willing not to bill the 
client but take a contingency when and if we prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there anything an employee can do to make a wrongful termination case 
airtight? 
</P>
<P>
A. The best thing to do if you can is to have an expressed contract, and almost 
the only time you will get that is when you are coming on board with a company 
because that is the honeymoon period when an employer wants someone with a 
specific skill or talent. Short of that, it's important for an employee to 
document any agreement or promises that an employer makes. Take a sales 
employee who is told verbally that if he reaches $150,000 in sales in a 
specific time period he will receive an extra 10% bonus. If I were that 
employee I would write a memo to that effect and send it to the person who sent 
it to me -- "In accordance with our discussion if I reach X dollars in sales I 
will be entitled to X percent extra commission." So as not to be too crass, 
because tact is always important, the employee might do that in the text of a 
memo about the extra sales efforts they intend to pursue to achieve the 
company's goal. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kind of employees realistically could get such an agreement? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think executives are the people who typically have an agreement of this 
type. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What should prospective employees look for in an employer? 
</P>
<P>
A. Employees considering joining a company should ask the personnel department 
to see a copy of the employee handbook and procedures. Carefully read what that 
employer says in its official documents regarding how it's prepared to treat 
its employees. Also, employees should be very wary of forms placed in front of 
them which may vary from what they have been told are the terms of their 
employment. For example, a manager recruiting an engineer from another 
aerospace company may make all sorts of promises regarding bonuses, career 
opportunities, et cetera, and yet the day they come on board they may have a 
document placed in front of them saying something like, "I am aware no one has 
authority to make any promises to me regarding length of employment and I can 
be terminated at any time for any reason." Six or seven months later, that 
employee is fired under circumstances which the employee believes to be 
unlawful and, lo and behold, the management lawyer takes out Exhibit 1, this 
preprinted form which says the employee can be fired any time for any reason 
and says "Didn't you sign this," and "Of course you read it and understood it, 
didn't you?" If you are asked to sign such a document, read it very carefully 
and scratch out anything that contradicts what has been promised you. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should a fired employee accept severance pay if he is thinking of suing? 
</P>
<P>
A. Employers do not have a legal obligation to pay severance. The fired 
employee presented with a severance package needs to assess whether the money 
being offered is worth accepting in exchange for giving up your potential 
claims. The average employee would probably need to consult counsel to 
determine whether they had a claim and its likely worth compared to the 
severance package being offered. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If your case does go to trial, how much can you win in damages? 
</P>
<P>
A. That depends on the law the suit is based on. In an implied contract claim, 
punitive damages -- those designed to punish and deter similar treatment in the 
future -- are not available to you regardless of the outrageousness of the 
employer's conduct. You can get all out-of-pocket losses -- lost wages and lost 
benefits plus any catastrophic losses which flowed from the termination. For 
example, an employee out of work might lose his home because he can't make the 
mortgage payments. Emotional distress damages can also be pursued if such 
distress foreseeably resulted from the termination. Under the Fair Employment 
and Housing Act, you can get everything I just described plus punitive damages 
and attorney's fees. So if a person was sexually harassed at work and brought a 
claim under the FEHA, the remedies are potentially much greater than someone 
whose contract was breached.

ORIGINAL T.S.O.L. BAND'S REUNION SHOW PACKS NOSTALGIA, LACKS FOCUS

Steve Soto, who knows a few things about Orange County punk rock, sat in the 
upper rows of the Celebrity Theatre Friday night, surveying the house a few 
minutes before the original members of T.S.O.L. were about to go on stage 
together for the first time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our high school reunion," said Soto, who was co-founder of Agent 
Orange and the Adolescents, two of the leading bands that came out of the 
Orange County punk rock explosion of 1979-80. Then Soto said something else: 
"There's money in punk-rock rehash." 
</P>
<P>
That pretty much explained why the show was taking place. And the high school 
reunion aspect had a lot to with why a near-capacity crowd (2,279 paid, 
according to promoter Gary Tovar of Goldenvoice Presents) had turned out to see 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Other bands from the Orange County punk wave wrote songs that were better and 
more melodic than the original T.S.O.L., and some groups had more staying 
power. But T.S.O.L. (True Sounds of Liberty) built a reputation as the most 
sensational, tempestuous and unpredictable live act of the local punk scene 
during the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The reunion brought out some younger fans who never had seen the band before -- 
like Christina Palmer, a 15-year-old from San Bernardino County who was 
scrounging change outside the theater before the show to raise the price of a 
ticket. She said that her interest in T.S.O.L. had been handed down from an 
older generation of punkers, an aunt and uncle now in their 20s and 30s. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Mora, a tall, hulking punk rock fan from Hollywood, said he used to go 
see the original T.S.O.L. in Los Angeles when he was barely in his teens. Mora, 
20, grumbled about how he could get in for as little as $1 to $5 in those days, 
compared to the $20 he had paid to see T.S.O.L.'s reunion. "For all the money 
they're getting, they'd better have a lot of energy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, T.S.O.L. had enough energy to get by, but not enough focus or 
group cohesiveness to infuse the show with much beyond nostalgia value. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Mike Roche (who came out wearing a top hat and red bandanna on his head 
and a skull mask on his face) kept up a fast, rumbling pulse along with drummer 
Todd Barnes, but the rhythm section only occasionally kicked the beat to a 
surging peak. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Ron Emory generated the most musical excitement of the bunch, 
consistently churning out raw, slashing riffs and solos that often took on a 
charged rockabilly edge reminiscent of Billy Zoom's work during the punk heyday 
of X. Emory, now a member of Lunchbox, captured the roaring spirit of punk rock 
with his one lead vocal of the night, spitting out convincing scorn for 
authority during "Die for Me." Emory and lead singer Jack Grisham also raised 
some effective punk ire with their call-and-response screams on one thrashing 
number. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that was the only truly interactive moment of the 50-minute 
show. For the most part, Roche stayed in the background and Emory played in 
self-contained, if intense, solitude at stage right, leaving Grisham to caper 
about in his old role as T.S.O.L.'s ringleader and rabble rouser. 
</P>
<P>
Grisham alluded to the fact that the band hadn't played together in seven 
years, but there wasn't a flicker of warmth and sentiment between these old 
cronies. No smiles exchanged, no pinball-style physical contact between players 
(always helpful for a punk show), not even an introduction of the band members 
or a mutual bow at the end. 
</P>
<P>
The old personal animosities that split the band apart didn't surface, but the 
four T.S.O.L. alumni appeared only to have contrived a truce for business 
purposes, not a reconciliation born of rediscovered fondness for the good old 
days and each other. Still, this aloofness was better and more true to the 
take-us-as-we-are punk ethic than a feigned camaraderie would have been. 
</P>
<P>
The concert wound up being mainly a vehicle for Grisham, the big, lithe, 
naturally charismatic front man who spent the show moving about in graceful, 
loping strides. Grisham, who now leads the hard rock band Tender Fury, doesn't 
have an exceptionally rangy or powerful voice, but he hammed it up with the 
theatrical, half-crooned, half-spoken vocals that distinguished T.S.O.L. from 
its more snarling hard-core punk competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 or so songs that T.S.O.L. performed all were drawn from the two EPs and 
two albums the original band released during its original run from 1980 to 
1983. One of the early T.S.O.L.'s virtues was its willingness to experiment 
with musical styles. The band changed with each recording, and that paid off in 
its reunion by allowing for a variety of tone -- a rarity among punk rockers. 
There were thrashing, politically oriented songs that railed at authority, the 
lighter, more melodic approach of the reggae-inflected "Word Is," the 
disgusting but funny necrophiliac fantasy of "Code Blue" and textured melodrama 
on songs like "The Triangle," with its spy story full of paranoia, and the 
stormily romantic "Wash Away." Most of the songs came off as grist for 
Grisham's performance, rather than as deeply felt expression in which the song 
itself mattered more than the singer. 
</P>
<P>
Grisham has said he got into punk rock as a teen-ager because he saw it as an 
outlet for his adolescent delight in all-purpose hell-raising. His instigator's 
streak surfaced at the Celebrity, as he egged on an already tumultuous crowd to 
leap over a wooden barrier and on to the stage. The many who tried didn't fare 
very well: a cordon of linebacker-size security men would grasp each would-be 
stage crasher in a bear hug and hustle the intruder out of the auditorium. But 
if the aim of singer and audience was to recreate the tumult of the good old 
days of punk, they pretty much succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
(Whether out of savvy, instinct, or blind luck, Grisham picked just the right 
moment to stall the show and let emotions subside at the point when the 
turbulence in front of the stage threatened to get out of hand. He did so by 
taking off his shoes and promising to perform naked. But Grisham, stripped to 
the waist through most of the show, managed to keep his leather tights and 
codpiece in place for the remainder of the concert). 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise of the show was Grisham's announcement from the stage that 
what was to have been a one-time reunion will have a sequel Tuesday night at 
Raji's nightclub in Hollywood. That show will be recorded for a live album 
(Peter Heur, president of Triple X Records, said the second show was arranged 
to avoid a $2,500 fee that the Celebrity Theatre required to record Friday 
night's concert). 
</P>
<P>
The decision to do a live album, which Heur said will be a joint release by 
Triple X and Enigma Records, will have consequences for Mike Roche. Until now, 
Roche had been the last original member of T.S.O.L. still playing with the 
second-generation version of T.S.O.L., which has continued to tour and record 
since 1984 while phasing out punk music in favor of a blues-rock and 
heavy-metal slant. Roche's partners in the current T.S.O.L., Joe Wood and Mitch 
Dean, had consented to his playing Friday's reunion only after much internal 
haggling that threatened to split the band. The current members said they 
aren't going to stand for Roche taking part in a reunion album as well, and 
Roche said in a post-show interview that he is being ousted from T.S.O.L. as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
"They said if I do this record I'm out of the band," Roche said. "I'm doing the 
show (at Raji's). If it is so bitter and they want to replace me, I don't want 
to play with them any more. We can't keep riding the merry-go-round." Roche 
said he is considering legal action either to prevent Wood and Dean from 
continuing to use the name T.S.O.L., or to gain financial compensation for use 
of the name he says he originated. 
</P>
<P>
Wood confirmed Saturday that the current T.S.O.L. was planning to perform 
Saturday night in Montclair with a new bass player, Dave Mello. "I have the 
ideal band. I'm happy," Wood said, dismissing the notion that Roche has more 
claim to the T.S.O.L. name than he and Dean. 
</P>
<P>
Wood has maintained that Roche's personal problems, more than the tension over 
the original T.S.O.L.'s reunion, have undermined Roche's position in the band. 
"If Mike gets his (stuff) together, he's welcome back (in the current 
T.S.O.L.). He needs to get his priorities lined up."

EARLY EXHIBITS TO DISPLAY CONTEMPORARY LOOK

<P>
Well, out with the old year, in with the new. What's coming up on the visual 
arts scene in Orange County? Happily, some impressive-sounding shows -- nearly 
all devoted to contemporary work -- are on tap for the first six months of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
One important point to keep in mind: While it's great for our museums and 
galleries to host fine shows organized elsewhere, an institution's real 
prestige comes from having done the planning, thinking and legwork on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Newport's first big blast for the year opens April 8. "OBJECTives: THE NEW 
SCULPTURE," (through June 24) is chief curator Paul Schimmel's last project 
before he leaves for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. The show 
presents a type of work by younger American and European artists that has come 
to dominate the offerings of a number of major galleries in L.A., New York and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Neo-Geo" or "Simulationism" in the United States, this work is about 
our attitudes toward everyday objects and the way they reflect assumptions held 
by the society that produced them. 
</P>
<P>
Without knowing these works were created by artists and meant to carry a 
particular set of meanings, viewers are likely to see such pieces merely as 
mass-produced kitsch, a bizarre kind of window dressing or the whims of an 
eccentric collector. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, work such as this cries out for explication -- a task that a museum 
survey is equipped to undertake. Artists in the show include the much-lauded, 
much-derided Jeff Koons as well as Grenville Davey, Katharina Fritsch, Annette 
Lemieux, Julian Opie, Haim Steinbach and Robert Gober. Financial support comes 
from the Irvine Co. and the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Associate curator Lucinda Barnes' first show at Newport Harbor is also the 
first one-person exhibition of Buzz Spector's art in California (Jan. 21 
through March 18). An art critic and former book designer, Spector transforms 
books "from object(s) of communication into . . . object(s) of the 
imagination," as a Museum of Modern Art curator has written. Part of the 
ongoing New California Artist series, the exhibit -- supported by the museum's 
Century Club -- presents several of the artist's "altered books" (created by 
tearing or carving) and one of his sculptural installations, made with 6,500 
stacked volumes. 
</P>
<P>
Although an exhibit called "Selections from the Permanent Collection" (Jan. 21 
through March 18) sounds like old news, Newport's includes some significant 
recent additions. One is "Rondo," an installation by celebrated "light and 
space" artist James Turrell, purchased with funds from the Peter Norton Family 
Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum's big contender -- the pet project of director Charles 
Desmarais -- is "The Profound in the Banal: The Art of Ilene Segalove" (April 
27 through July 8). The Los Angeles artist is well known for her deadpan 
videotapes exploring the amazing-but-true blend of blandness and weirdness 
experienced by middle-class suburbanite living in a consumer culture. 
</P>
<P>
The show -- funded in part by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts 
-- will include 30 large-scale photographic works, 12 videotapes and 20 audio 
works. (Viewers may already have heard some of Segalove's audio pieces on 
National Public Radio's "All Things Considered" and "Morning Edition.") 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum's South Coast Plaza Satellite site starts the new year 
with a group of installations by San Francisco artist Paul Kos (Jan. 11 through 
April 15). His new piece, "Ber lin" -- the title is divided to represent the 
Berlin Wall -- incorporates neon, lights, two-by-fours and cuckoo clocks as 
metaphors for recent political upheaval in the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Kos' other work in the show includes a couple of recent pieces -- "Silenced 
Tongues" and "Trotsky" -- as well as "rEVOLUTION: Notes for the Invasion -- mar 
mar march" from 1973, in which the rat-a-tat-tat of a typewriter stuttering 
over the same word creates a hypnotic, marchlike cadence. 
</P>
<P>
How brave of South Coast Plaza, which is bearing some of the costs of the show, 
to have opened its pocketbook for such subversive-sounding stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Other exhibits are imports from points east and north. 
</P>
<P>
"Success Is a Job in New York ... The Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol" 
runs from Jan 21 through March 18 at Newport Harbor, where is also is funded by 
South Coast Plaza. Organized by the Grey Art Gallery and Study Center at New 
York University, the show traces the artist's early commercial and 
non-commercial art, before he became a big shot in the Pop world.

In 1959 Warhol came to New York from Pittsburgh, a 21-year-old with a design 
degree from Carnegie Tech. His early jobs were with ad agencies, fashion 
magazines and department stores. (The show's title comes from a magazine 
article Warhol illustrated.) A few years later he was hired to design book 
jackets and record albums, and he dabbled in "image shaping" for retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
Only in 1957 did he give up commercial stints to focus on his own art -- which 
was, of course, derived from the look of advertisements and throwaway media 
imagery. 
</P>
<P>
"Jay DeFeo: Works on Paper 1951-1989," which runs July 13 through Oct. 7 at the 
main location of the Laguna Art Museum, was organized by the University Art 
Museum, Berkeley. DeFeo, who died in November at 60, showed at the Ferus 
Gallery in Los Angeles and was included in the prestigious "Sixteen Americans" 
show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1959. One of the few women 
painters of her era to hold her own with the big boys of the art world, she 
worked in both figurative and abstract modes. 
</P>
<P>
This exhibit -- funded by the Exhibitionists, a Laguna Art Museum council -- 
includes drawings, photo collages and paintings on paper. 
</P>
<P>
For the die-hard lovers of California Impressionism, Laguna is trotting out 
"Colors and Impressions: The Early Work of E. Charlton Fortune" on Feb. 2 
(through April 15). Fortune was one of the handful of women (the "E" stood for 
Euphemia) among the painters who introduced the French style so belatedly to 
California in the 'teens of this century. Originated by the Monterey Peninsula 
Museum of Art, the exhibit is supported in Laguna Beach by 
Wittenberg/Livingston Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The non-commercial galleries also have come up with a bunch of shows that sound 
well worth checking out: 
</P>
<P>
"John Paul Jones: The Man in the Mirror: The Constant Image" opens Jan. 9 at 
the Art Institute of Southern California in Laguna Beach (through Feb. 20). 
Phyllis Lutjeans, guest curator for the show, says it is not a real 
retrospective; instead, as she modestly says, it's based on "a funky idea I 
had." The exhibit includes about 40 works made by the UC Irvine art faculty 
member from 1948 to 1989. Lutjeans believes the somewhat murky, amorphous 
figurative images in Jones' early paintings and works on paper are strongly 
related to the sculptures he has been making recently, in which viewers can see 
reflections of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The redoubtably titled "California Collectors and Collections II: The Arts and 
Crafts Movement in California 1900-1918: Traditions and Antecedents" opens Feb. 
6 and runs through May 26 at the Center for the Study of Decorative Arts in San 
Juan Capistrano. This movement -- led by English poet-artist-craftsman William 
Morris -- was a revolt against the lack of quality and overdone embellishment 
in machine-made Victorian furnishings. As Morris once said: "Have nothing in 
your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
In California, the Arts and Crafts spirit involved the use of restrained 
designs and lavish use of natural woods, metals and minerals. It was kept alive 
by such true believers as Greene &amp; Greene, the Pasadena architecture firm; 
furniture maker Gustav Stickley; and Dirk van Erp, a San Francisco lamp maker. 
Their influences will be visible in this exhibit of furniture, ceramics, 
metalwork, lamps and textiles, including period rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Only sparse information was available last week about upcoming offerings at 
Saddleback College Art Gallery in Mission Viejo, but they include "Leningrad 
Artists," Feb. 8 through March 9, recent work by painters who broke away from 
the officially sanctioned styles and subjects of art in the U.S.S.R. The 
exhibit is curated by Selma Holo of the Fischer Gallery at the University of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Coming up Jan. 7 (through Feb. 10) at the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery is "The 
Pleasure and the Terror: An Exhibition of Landscapes," works by Los Angeles 
artists Richard Sedivy and Lynn Aldrich. He does mixed-media constructions on 
canvas; her works are free-standing painted sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
Sedivy is a popular guy in these parts: His paintings also can be seen in 
"Insistent Landscapes" at Security Pacific Gallery in Costa Mesa. Opening Feb. 
3 (through April 1), the exhibit includes paintings by Lawrence Gipe (whose 
work was at the Laguna museum a couple of years ago), Tobi Kahn, Marcia Cygli 
King, Vicki Teague-Cooper and Jean Towgood. For that matter, work by Annette 
Lemieux (shown concurrently in Newport Harbor's "OBJECTives") makes another 
appearance in a Security Pacific show provisionally called "Representational 
and Non-Representational Strategies" (April 21 to June 3), along with Moira 
Dryer, David French, Jim Iserman, Ronald Jones, Lari Pittman, Rosemarie Trockel 
and Sohki Wagner. Meanwhile, the gallery's Project Room gets a mysterious new 
tenant: an installation by Los Angeles artist Michael McMillen called "Train of 
Thought" (Feb. 3 through July 29). 
</P>
<P>
Art, architecture and music are the topics of several hot-ticket lectures and 
lecture series this winter and spring at the museums.

THE MARSHAL OF CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
TOUCHED BY A SCANDAL, SEN. JOHN GLENN WILL STILL BE AN ASTRONAUT-HERO TO MANY 
WHEN LEADING TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE 
</P>

<P>
It has been a bit of a sticky wicket, conceded Tournament of Roses president 
Don Fedde -- "We don't like controversy more than anybody else. Let's put it 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
But here was Fedde, a genial 52-year-old furniture store owner who has served 
the tournament faithfully for 25 years, finally getting his shot at the top job 
and with it the honor of choosing the grand marshal for today's Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
And, bingo, controversy. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 12, with flair and flourishes, former astronaut John H. Glenn, now a U. 
S. senator from Ohio, was announced as grand marshal for today's 101st 
Tournament of Roses parade. Announcing his choice, Fedde had praised Glenn as 
"a hero with steely nerves and harmonious hometown values. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 13, in what Fedde understatedly describes as an "unfortunate" bit of 
timing, the Common Cause citizens' lobby called for investigations of five 
senators, including Glenn and California's Alan Cranston, on charges they 
improperly interfered with a federal investigation of now-bankrupt Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee announced 2 1/2 weeks ago that it was beginning a 
preliminary investigation to determine whether the five had abused their 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn's integrity, heretofore untarnished, is being questioned, the key issue 
being whether Lincoln owner Charles Keating bought Glenn's influence with a 
$200,000 contribution to a political action committee controlled by the Ohio 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
"On selection day, we had thought it was the greatest (pick) we could have 
made," Fedde said, adding that Glenn had been a noncontroversial choice for 
grand marshal, a standout among the dozen or so finalists that included 
musicians, actors -- and former Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the committee was left to wonder if its hero might have feet of clay. 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that there was never any serious thought given to uninviting 
Glenn. "We couldn't find any basis," he said. "There's nothing but innuendo. 
The innuendo has been very heavy, admittedly. But we think we know all the 
facts." 
</P>
<P>
As the "Keating 5" scandal grew, Fedde made it his business to learn everything 
he could about it. "I read every article, taped every program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
From Washington, Fedde obtained a copy of the transcript of the meeting that 
took place in April, 1987, with the five senators and federal thrift 
regulators, a meeting called at the urging of Charles Keating. 
</P>
<P>
From Glenn, he got a copy of an eight-page statement the senator wrote around 
Thanksgiving, explaining what he did and did not do, and concluding: "My life 
has been, and remains, an open book. . . . It's been a life based on decency, 
honor, integrity and the highest ethical standards. I have not changed, and 
with every fiber in my being, I resent anyone implying otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Never, Fedde said, was there one terrible moment of crisis when the 
tournament's nine-man executive committee sat down and asked themselves, "What 
do we do now?" It was more a matter of worrying about how big this thing was 
going to get and how soon. 
</P>
<P>
Although they continued to read about the savings and loan scandal and Glenn, 
Fedde said, "We have looked into it deeply and we feel his conscience is clear, 
and we think time will prove our decision to be the right one to proceed with 
him. . . . He is a national hero and we still consider him so. . . . We just 
want to honor a space pioneer." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, some may be critical of the tournament's choice for grand marshal, Fedde 
shrugged. Last year, the honor went to Shirley Temple Black, hardly a wildly 
controversial figure, and, he said, "We even got letters on her." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Glenn, for his part, appeared to be enjoying himself enormously as 
he dutifully worked his way through three days of formalities leading up to the 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday morning, shortly after returning from a jog, he said he 
wasn't worried about the Keating scandal -- "Not at all. That'll all come out 
all right. I'm not concerned." Everything will be OK, he added, when "what I 
did not do comes out." 
</P>
<P>
Had he at any time considered withdrawing as grand marshal? "No, not at all. I 
had no reason to step down. . . . If people have been misled by the media, 
well, I'm sorry about that. But I know the American people to be very fair." 
</P>
<P>
For the long haul, Glenn said, he is not concerned. In the short run, he 
acknowledged, his implication in the Keating affair, is "very irritating." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl game, "We've watched every year on TV," he 
said. "Of course, I'd hoped maybe Ohio State (not Michigan) might be here. I 
guess we're character-building this year." 
</P>
<P>
The entire Glenn family will be on hand. Annie, his wife, will ride with him. 
In the stands will be their son, Dr. David Glenn, an anesthesiologist in San 
Francisco, his wife, Karen, and their sons, Daniel, 7, and Zachary, 5, as well 
as the Glenns' daughter, Lyn, who lives in St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn hopes to get some good film along the route with his new hand-held 
camcorder. 
</P>
<P>
There is no indication that he intends to let the cloud of scandal rain on his 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking forward to it," he said. "I'm really getting a big kick out of 
it. It's a great honor." 
</P>
<P>
At his first official appearance as grand marshal, at the annual Kiwanis 
kickoff luncheon Friday at The Pasadena Center, the reception Glenn received 
indicated that, in the eyes of the public, he is still the bona fide hero who 
became the first American to orbit the globe in the little Friendship 7 
capsule, one February morning 28 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As he was introduced by Fedde as "the perfect person" to lead this year's 
parade, Glenn -- the World War II bomber pilot, Korean War fighter pilot and a 
test pilot who once set a transcontinental speed record -- received a steady 
round of applause, building to a crescendo, then to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
He responsed with a patriotic pep talk, in which he spoke of "walls tumbling 
down" and "dictators tumbling down" throughout Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
A fit and youthful-looking 68, Glenn, who became a multimillionaire through 
investments in hotels and who briefly was a Democratic Presidential candidate, 
breezed through a Saturday morning of television interviews at Tournament House 
in Pasadena. He described for one interviewer how weightlessness in space 
feels, talked about the California sunshine and the bitter cold back home in 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Fedde seemed well pleased. Everything seemed harmonious, nicely in keeping with 
this year's parade theme, "A World of Harmony." 
</P>
<P>
That theme had proved to be an inspired choice this particular year, although, 
Fedde acknowledged, "What we had in mind was the wonderful Reagan-Gorbachev 
relationship. How were we to know about these incredible world events?" 
</P>
<P>
Still, the accolades for omniscience were music to his ears in a year when 
tournament-bashing appeared to be in vogue. Although there have been reports 
that parade and game tickets were all but going begging, not so, Fedde said. 
Sales, he said, were only "minutely off." 
</P>
<P>
And there were the critics asking, once again, if it is moral to spend hundreds 
of thousands of dollars to build pretty floats when there are thousands of 
people hungry and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always an anti-Establishment element," Fedde said, observing that the 
festivities are more than "just a party," that $10 million in television 
revenues are divided among the 20 Big 10 and Pac 10 schools. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he observed, "on a cost per impression basis, (a float) is one of the 
best bargains in the world" for corporate America. It's advertising, PR, so 
"why not say it in a joyous, beautiful way?" 
</P>
<P>
He was more concerned about glitches that could arise, even after 18 months of 
planning. What was going to happen to the people who traditionally park on the 
other side of the arroyo and walk over Colorado Bridge? The bridge has been 
closed as unsafe but, he knows, "they're not going to be aware of it until New 
Year's morning." 
</P>
<P>
A giant robot, the parade entry from General Motors-United Auto Workers, had 
been a potential troublemaker, 40 feet wide (that's 22 feet over what's 
allowed). The committee worked that one out. Said Fedde, "We've put the arms on 
separate circuits so one arm can go down when the other one comes up." 
</P>
<P>
The committee, he said, had been very, very busy dealing with requests for 
exceptions to size limits: "We don't want the parade to be a size race, a 
budget race or a horsepower race." 
</P>
<P>
Fedde had just received a memo from one of his staff with the information that 
the lead car in this year's parade, a 1952 Chrysler Imperial Phaeton limousine, 
was the very car that appeared in the 1984 film, "The Right Stuff," carrying 
actor Ed Harris as astronaut Glenn in the tumultuous New York ticker tape 
parade in his honor in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
(Glenn greeted this news with his opinion that the whole film should have been 
left on the cutting room floor). 
</P>
<P>
It was all about to happen. Horses, parades, floats. 
</P>
<P>
And an embattled American hero as grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
Fedde emphasized that all of his opinions on the Glenn matter were just that, 
his opinions, adding, "Nothing in this world is absolutely certain. We're 
running on faith, and that's all you can do."

ERA ENDS AS JONES EXITS TOP POST AT NORTHROP CORP.; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: IN HIS 30 YEARS AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE HE LED THE COMPANY FROM RELATIVE 
OBSCURITY TO A PLACE AS A MAJOR MILITARY PRIME CONTRACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The last of the aerospace industry Titans, the men who became synonymous with 
their corporations and the aircraft they produced, is gone with the departure 
of Thomas V. Jones as chief executive of Northrop Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who at Northrop's helm for 30 years came to personify the maverick 
aerospace company and who survived an astonishing succession of personal 
controversies, will remain its chairman but will retire today as an employee of 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the aerospace industry has rushed to give Jones several major 
awards for his career accomplishments, adding to the long list of recognitions 
that he has received as an aviation leader. The City of Hawthorne even named a 
park for him. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones is stepping down from his post with the company still under 
indictment on criminal charges and facing several investigations by federal 
grand juries in Los Angeles and elsewhere. And although he undoubtedly built 
Northrop into a leading prime contractor, the success of his legacy depends on 
the outcome of several risky programs. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't make them like Jones anymore," said Paine Webber aerospace analyst 
Joseph Campbell. "Jones is the last of the old guard. It is the passing of an 
era -- rightfully so." 
</P>
<P>
Jones declined to be interviewed for this story. A Northrop spokesman said 
Jones was so busy that he had no time to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Jones came from a time when aerospace chiefs made gutsy big gambles on new 
technology, and Jones made some of the biggest wagers in history. He bet $1.2 
billion of shareholder money on the F-20 jet fighter during the 1980s and 
failed to sell one. But he also gambled big on the B-2 Stealth bomber program 
and turned the industry on its ear by winning. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, he transformed a relatively small and flagging aerospace 
company in the late 1950s into one of the major military prime contractors in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"He took Northrop to a commanding position, at least technologically and in the 
engineering systems to exploit that technology," said Prudential-Bache analyst 
Paul Nisbet. "He has been a strong factor in bringing the company to where it 
is, though there is divided opinion over exactly where that is." 
</P>
<P>
Jones is leaving with the company deeply in debt and with a market value of 
just $823 million, less than what two of his Stealth bombers cost. Northrop is 
teetering on the edge of tremendous success or virtual extinction, depending on 
the outcome of the B-2 and the advanced tactical fighter, or ATF, programs. 
</P>
<P>
However those programs fare, Jones was a driving force behind the development 
of the F-5 jet fighter, the T-38 Air Force trainer and the Navy YF-17, which 
became the basis for the current F-18 jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
"He should be remembered as an enormously effective pioneer of new airplanes," 
said Thomas O. Paine, a former Northrop president. "He has an incredibly 
powerful personal determination to succeed against all odds." 
</P>
<P>
But Jones had another side to his personality -- a penchant for bold acts that 
often carried an unnecessary risk, according to another former colleague. 
</P>
<P>
"Jones brings to mind that statement from Adm. Arleigh Burke: 'Give me a strong 
ship, for I intend to sail into harm's way.' Well, Tom liked to sail into 
harm's way," the former colleague said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom gets a big kick out of getting into trouble and then getting out," he 
added. "It is ingrained in his personality." 
</P>
<P>
Jones got into more trouble and survived more often than probably any 
contemporary aerospace executive. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Jones signed a consent agreement with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in which he promised not to bribe any foreign officials. That was 
after the company had allegedly paid out $30 million to foreign officials in 
connection with international arms deals. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop, under Jones, became the consummate international arms merchant, 
selling its F-5 jet fighter to nations from Norway to Saudi Arabia. Jones 
became close to the Shah of Iran and at one time proudly displayed a Persian 
rug at the company headquarters that was a gift from the Shah. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also pleaded guilty to a federal felony count during the Watergate 
scandal in which he admitted to falsifying documents involving political 
contributions that were linked to a Richard Nixon slush fund. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, Jones agreed to form a board of directors that was 
constituted almost entirely of outsiders. But that board eventually became a 
source of support for him, backing such risky Jones ventures as the F-20, ATF 
and B-2. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much more you can accomplish," said William Ballhaus, a board 
member who has known Jones throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. J. Long, another board member, said Jones "made some significant 
contributions to the whole aerospace industry." 
</P>
<P>
But Ballhaus and Long sought to dispel any doubt that Kent Kresa, the president 
and new chief executive, is in full control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Jones' precise role will be determined by (Kresa)," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
Ballhaus said: "It is a transition from the Jones era and it will now be the 
Kresa era. As a non-employee, Jones is free to go sail a boat. I am sure he 
will not be there (at his office) every day." 
</P>
<P>
The Kresa era will also begin with a substantially new slate of top executives. 
Since the start of 1989, eight of Northrop's 22 elected corporate officers, 
many of whom were Jones cronies, have left. Most recently, Northrop general 
counsel William M. Elliott quietly departed the company at a time of legal 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
The company is facing probes by federal grand juries in Texas, Hawaii and 
California. One inquiry is into whether $7.75 million in payments to Koreans 
violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The company was also indicted 
on federal charges of criminal fraud earlier this year in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all these problems, Jones' departure was not forced on him, according 
to knowledgeable sources. 
</P>
<P>
A former Northrop executive said: "It was a situation where Jones himself 
recognized it was time to leave. There were people in Washington, in the Air 
Force and at the Pentagon, who let it be known that they would not be unhappy 
if he retired."

MERCENARIES: MIKE HARARI ONCE WORKED FOR MOSSAD. BUT HE BECAME THE PANAMA

<P>
The news proved false, but a report last week that Mike Harari, an Israeli 
mercenary and right-hand man to deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega, 
was under arrest caused brief anxiety among government officials here. 
</P>
<P>
Harari is a former agent in the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, who 
gained prominence as a figure in business and arms dealings between Israel and 
Panama, of which he was reported to take hefty commissions. Harari also trained 
anti-terrorist and private security squads for Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli diplomats in Panama and American congressmen have warned Israel on 
several occasions that if Noriega and Washington collided, Harari could prove 
to be an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Before word arrived that U.S. troops had in fact not detained Harari, officials 
here had already moved to disown him. Whatever he was doing, he was doing it on 
his own, they insisted. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a private citizen. As far as I know, he has no connection with the 
government of Israel," said Yosef Amihud, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Harari say that he is in Israel, Israel Radio reported last week. 
It is not yet clear whether Harari would face charges in Panama if he were 
captured. 
</P>
<P>
Harari, 62, is the second prominent Israeli whose tangled relationships with 
suspected Latin American drug dealers made Israel blush last year. Officials in 
Colombia accused Yair Klein, a retired army colonel, of training killers on 
behalf of cocaine smugglers. Klein said he was training cattle ranchers to 
defend themselves against terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
The Harari and Klein cases had another common thread: Both men evidently traded 
on skills that have limited marketability in their home country, once their 
official services ended. There are more than 800 Israeli companies that export 
anti-terrorist, paramilitary and security training overseas; most are manned by 
former soldiers and intelligence agents. 
</P>
<P>
Harari's long career with the Mossad included some of the agency's most deadly 
missions. He headed a force of "hit squads" to kill Palestinian terrorists in 
Europe. Harari's Mossad career seemed at an end when, in the mid-1970s, one of 
the hit squads mistook a Moroccan waiter in Norway for an Arab terrorist and 
shot him dead. 
</P>
<P>
Harari also served as Mossad chief for Mexico and Central America before 
retiring in the late 1970s. After leaving the Mossad, Harari managed a large 
insurance firm for a while, published reports here said. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1983, Harari was reported to be selling arms to Panama. An Israeli 
partnership that included Harari won a contract to harvest lumber in Panama, 
and he was a middleman in deals that led to Israeli participation in public 
works and telephone projects in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Harari appeared in Jerusalem with credentials from the Panamanian 
government appointing him honorary consul in Israel, and he headed Panama's 
commercial mission here. That same year, he was photographed -- wearing his 
trademark aviator sunglasses -- escorting Panama's civilian president at that 
time, Eric A. Delvalle, around Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers reported that businessmen here resented Harari because they 
said he demanded participation in any dealings with Panama. "Mister 60%," his 
detractors called him. In 1988, Jose Blandon, Noriega's former consul in New 
York, told U.S. congressional investigators that Harari managed arms-smuggling 
operations for Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Israeli newspapers reported that Washington asked Israel to 
recall Harari from Panama, but Jerusalem responded that it had no control over 
him. But intelligence observers point out that it is rare for former Mossad 
officials to completely sever their links with the intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It would strain relations with the U.S. if someone working for Israel was also 
undermining the Americans in a place like Panama," said one observer.

GOVERNMENT: THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IS NOT THE PRESIDENT OR EVEN A PANAMANIAN.

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man who runs Panama has an office in the Presidential Palace and roars 
through town in a bulletproof limousine accompanied by armored cars full of 
large, heavily armed bodyguards who wear ominous dark glasses. 
</P>
<P>
He decides who can walk free and who goes to jail, when citizens can be on the 
street and when they have to be in their houses, and even what avenues are open 
to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
This man is not President Guillermo Endara, nor is he the popular, charismatic 
2nd Vice President Guillermo (Billy) Ford, nor the intellectual 1st Vice 
President Ricardo Arias Calderon. He isn't even a Panamanian. 
</P>
<P>
And if you thought, well, it must be the American ambassador, you would be 
wrong. The man who runs Panama is a middle-aged career diplomat who has never 
reached the rank of ambassador -- in fact, he's never held a post higher than 
that of the No. 2 diplomat in the American Embassy in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
He is a tall, stooped American with thinning hair and a desire not to be 
identified in public. His name is John Bushnell -- and he is the closest thing 
the United States has to a proconsul. 
</P>
<P>
While Endara, a once-obscure lawyer with no political following, is enjoying 
the public trappings of office -- a Mercedes-Benz limousine, a tricolored 
presidential sash and bowing and scraping aides, Bushnell wears a simple, white 
sport shirt and nondescript slacks. 
</P>
<P>
The only things that set him apart from the crowd are his security guards and a 
white bulletproof vest that he wears outside his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
But, when the new Panamanian government was temporarily located in the Foreign 
Ministry, the two vice presidents had their offices in cramped quarters on the 
first floor -- while Bushnell was ensconced next to Endara in comfortable rooms 
on the second floor. He even lives in the same building where Endara, Ford and 
Arias live near the American Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
If Bushnell appears unassuming and his title is nothing more than U.S. deputy 
chief of mission, the people in the know here know who to talk to when things 
need to be done. 
</P>
<P>
When U.S. troops stepped over the bounds of international law and violated the 
diplomatic sanctity of the Nicaraguan ambassador by raiding his official 
residence, it was Bushnell who was called and who fixed things. 
</P>
<P>
And when American troops were trying to unnerve ousted dictator Manuel A. 
Noriega by playing loud rock music outside his hiding place in the Vatican 
embassy, it was Bushnell who ordered the broadcasts toned down after the 
Vatican's emissary complained that he couldn't sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell is reported to have approved sending American troops to seal the area 
around the Peruvian Embassy because of reports that Noriega might seek asylum 
there, and he was the one the Peruvian ambassador complained to. 
</P>
<P>
"No diplomat calls (U.S.) Ambassador (Arthur) Davis; he doesn't count," said a 
European envoy about Davis -- the almost invisible political appointee who is 
mocked by some associates as Elmer Fudd because he has a slight speech 
impediment. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Bushnell has signed off on curfew hours set for this capital 
city and makes the final decisions on which former Noriega officials and 
cronies are arrested. And, says a senior embassy official who asked not to be 
identified, until the Panamanian government is capable of assuming police and 
security functions, "the embassy is in operational control" of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
That means, says a different official, John Bushnell. 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell's role is not the only unusual aspect of life in Panama in the wake of 
the Dec. 20 American invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that invasion has been a massive influx of reporters and broadcast 
technicians. At one point, the figure reached nearly 500, many of whom had 
never covered a military operation nor been near danger. 
</P>
<P>
The number of journalists quickly overwhelmed the American military's capacity 
to deal with them. To pare down the total to something manageable, the U.S. 
Southern Command took an imaginative approach that showed more originality than 
some of its battle tactics. 
</P>
<P>
First, the military made life very uncomfortable -- preventing reporters from 
leaving U.S. bases but not providing places to sleep, adequate facilities for 
filing their dispatches or sufficient food. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the soldiers turned to scare tactics. After describing how his car had 
been shot at near the American Embassy and saying that "it is war out there," 
Col. Ronald Sconyers, the Southern Command's spokesman, said a charter flight 
had been arranged to take anyone to Miami who wanted to go. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 125 of the 300 journalists in the room immediately signed on for the 
trip, even though none had been outside of the American-run Howard Air Base 
here or had been in Panama for more than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Noriega has been thoroughly discredited -- and even the former 
dictator's most loyal supporters now sport Endara T-shirts -- some signs of the 
former regime remain. 
</P>
<P>
Standing 20 feet tall on Via Espana, one of Panama City's busiest streets, is a 
huge poster, unblemished by graffiti, pronouncing "Carlos Duque, President." 
</P>
<P>
Duque was Noriega's handpicked presidential candidate who was embarrassingly 
trounced in last May's vote. Noriega ultimately annulled the results. Duque is 
being sought by the U.S. military.

CARING FOR THE EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Events converged during 1988 to make the state of the Earth a matter of keen 
public concern. Now comes the difficult part. In 1989 the involved officials 
must move forcefully to translate that concern into serious public policy so 
that this new awareness does not become just another passing trend or lost 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The issues will not go away. There is a danger, however, that the enormousness 
of the collective problem will overwhelm a public desire to do something. After 
all, what can one person do about the atmosphere or the ocean? The United 
States has become a result-oriented nation that likes to see some bang for its 
buck, and soon. A dollar invested today to avert a global-warming crisis may 
have no visible payoff for decades. 
</P>
<P>
But perception is critically important. What made 1988 the year of the Earth 
may have been a coincidence of unrelated and largely irrelevant circumstances. 
The appearance of medical waste on Atlantic beaches or the Yellowstone Park 
fires had nothing to do with the ozone hole. The 1988 drought may have had 
nothing to do with global warming. The growing trash crisis certainly did not. 
But all these events impinged on the public consciousness until they set off an 
alarm bell: Something is very wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of this public attention cannot be underrated. But little 
happened in 1988 that was new or surprising to most environmental scientists. 
And Earthlings possess most or all of the technical equipment needed to slow or 
halt just about all the bad things that are assaulting the planet. What has 
been lacking is the public demand, the political will and an institutional 
structure for facing the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The new year provides the opportunity for setting this process in motion. The 
obvious source of leadership is the presidency. President-elect George Bush 
already has been inundated with stacks of studies for combatting environmental 
problems on a national and global scale. One of the best was compiled by a 
50-member bipartisan task force under the chairmanship of Sens. Timothy E. 
Wirth (D-Colo.) and John Heinz III (R-Pa.). In addition to the more traditional 
regulatory controls, the plan emphasizes the search for common ground and the 
development of market incentives for pollution control. 
</P>
<P>
The Wirth-Heinz outline also makes the critical point that the public must be 
informed of the full social costs of environmental action or inaction, not just 
the direct outlays. Because so many environmental issues are interrelated, some 
policies will attack several problems at once and provide multiple benefits. 
The energy-efficiency program advocated by the Wirth-Heinz study would help 
fight global warming, acid rain and local air pollution while also improving 
U.S. energy security and productivity. Short-term investments can yield 
long-range national economic benefits. Existing fragmented federal policies 
often work at cross-purposes or lack the public attention and support that they 
deserve. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will have to decide what he thinks are the most effective means of 
advancing the environmental agenda. An address to Congress is an obvious 
possibility. Or he could revive the dormant President's Council on 
Environmental Quality, which is supposed to serve as a clearing house and as a 
coordinator of programs. Better yet would be the creation of a Cabinet 
Department of the Environment that would consolidate the Environmental 
Protection Agency with related agencies from within the Interior and 
Agriculture departments. Most other industrialized nations created 
cabinet-level environmental agencies years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since so many of these issues observe no boundaries, the United States must 
pursue international agreements to control pollutants and preserve critical 
rain forests. The environment is an appropriate topic for the next superpower 
summit and the annual meeting of the Western industrial nations, leading 
perhaps to a global environmental conference. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental problems, from protection of U.S. wild lands to the global 
atmosphere, seem immense. Still, every citizen can have an effect. It begins 
with caring.

JUDGE'S RULING IN BABY KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I was a medical student in Sacramento in the 1970s, I was a member of a 
multidisciplinary team of professionals who worked hundreds of hours a year 
attempting to help children who were battered, tortured, and mutilated by 
people who unfortunately had the biological capability of bearing them. 
</P>
<P>
One particularly disgusting example was a female who had killed one of her 
children, severely tortured two others, and finally managed to kill a third, 
who had been sent back into the home by a "compassionate" judge who felt that 
the biological mother was more valuable than a foster one. This woman was 
admitted to our hospital in Sacramento to bear another child. 
</P>
<P>
Our child abuse team reacted quickly, obtaining a court order to take the 
newborn child away. The woman sued, but quickly dropped the case, deciding to 
move to Nevada and "have all the babies I want." I felt a profound sense of 
nausea, sadness, and anger for weeks following that horrible case. The outcome 
caused one of our social workers to resign -- she just couldn't handle these 
situations anymore. 
</P>
<P>
I felt the same sense of nausea, sadness, and anger when I read the article 
regarding Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald's ruling in the case of Sheryl Lynn 
Massip's battering and eventual murder of her infant son ("Judge Clears Mother 
Who Killed Baby," Part I, Dec. 24). 
</P>
<P>
From my previous reading about the case, there would appear little doubt that 
the woman battered and killed her son. A jury of her peers came to this 
conclusion after a long, and I am sure, emotionally difficult trial. There is 
little doubt in my mind also that the woman was emotionally distraught when she 
murdered her baby. 
</P>
<P>
But criminally insane? A much more profound proposition! When I worked as a 
family physician, I delivered hundreds of babies, and followed these kids and 
their mothers through the early years of their lives. No murders. A few 
distraught mothers who needed to talk out their frustrations, but no murders. 
What happened with Sheryl Lynn Massip? 
</P>
<P>
If Massip was criminally insane, why were the examining psychiatrists and her 
jurors unable to realize this? In explaining his reasoning, Judge Fitzgerald 
said, " . . . I didn't have any choice but to find her insane. . . . She was 
bonkers." Well, judge, I think you had two other fairly obvious choices: First, 
you could do your job as described by law; you could administer an appropriate 
sentence based upon the verdict handed down by the jury. A murder conviction 
demands a murder sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Second, if you truly bought the concept that the defendant was insane on the 
basis of postpartum depression, and was therefore totally out of control, you 
could have acted to save the lives of her future babies by ordering that the 
woman undergo sterilization. If she was truly insane as a result of her 
postpartum hormonal imbalance, why should she be any less insane with her next 
baby?

Since it seems quite likely that the Supreme Court will overturn or 
significantly modify Roe vs. Wade, Judge Fitzgerald's decision to reject the 
jury's guilty verdict in the Massip case is most timely. 
</P>
<P>
Abortions will no longer be necessary, anyway, now that the mother can run over 
the kid and plead "postpartum psychosis" (or "bonkers" to put it in the judge's 
more technical language).

THE CAMPUS AND PUBLIC SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Increasing numbers of college students want to serve their communities. Some 
help homeless people find shelter and services. Others tutor children or teach 
the illiterate how to read. Now a coalition of more than 40 California colleges 
and universities, public and private, has agreed to help these students to help 
others. The California Compact, as it is called, plans to work with communities 
to identify the problems on which students could work, try to win foundation 
support for these volunteer programs, and get faculty members as well as 
students involved. It's a gift of commitment that should not go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
The California Compact has just been launched as part of a national effort 
called Campus Compact, which is sponsored by the Education Commission of the 
States and has been in existence for several years. The California group is 
co-chaired by Stanford University President Don Kennedy and UCLA Chancellor 
Charles E. Young, and includes among others the University of Southern 
California, Occidental College, Claremont McKenna College, Los Angeles City 
College, the California State University system and the University of 
California campuses. The James Irvine Foundation has just announced a $120,000 
donation over the next three years to enable private universities to 
participate in the compact. 
</P>
<P>
It's just this kind of program that California legislators sought to foster 
when they passed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa 
Clara). That measure encouraged students to work 30 hours a year in their 
communities and urged their colleges to help them, in part by providing 
academic credit for some of their work. The efforts have gotten under way 
despite the governor's unwillingness to spend the $240,000 needed to help 
organize the program. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the organization of the compact, UCLA's Chancellor Young said 
recently that government resources may continue to be scarce, "but our human 
resources are potentially unlimited." He said that the colleges want to help 
build a "citizenry of problem solvers." 
</P>
<P>
People who have studied college life have said for years that higher education 
could be made more meaningful if it inculcated in young Americans the value of 
public service. The California Compact aims to make that recommendation a 
reality.

Extinction?" Editorial Page), bemoaned circumstances that forced her to join 
the "real word (of) exorbitant rents." However, this followed years of enjoying 
artificially low housing costs. An acknowledgement that the law (rent control, 
for example) can fix the price but not the cost of a commodity would have shown 
more real world awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is a mega-city beginning an explosive increase in population 
density; spacious lodgings in a desirable neighborhood in such a city are not 
easily had, particularly by those with low incomes. Most, like myself, wind up 
east or south of her neck of the woods, in whatever midway between splendor and 
squalor they can manage. 
</P>
<P>
There are 5 billion people in the world. If Rosenwein stopped worrying 
exclusively about developers and considered how many others would like to be 
where she is, the cost of her desired life style would be more explicable.

'CLEANING UP THE BALLOT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was pleased to read in The Times Dec. 26 editorial "Cleaning Up the Ballot" 
that you support initiative reform in California. The Times printed my 
initiative reform proposal "Keep the Initiatives but Reinvolve Legislators" on 
Nov. 27 (Op-Ed Page). 
</P>
<P>
While the indirect initiative process proposed by the League of Women Voters 
and supported by The Times sounds similar to my idea, there are some 
differences. According to the editorial, the League's proposal would allow 
initiative proponents to avoid the legislative process by requiring the 
signature gatherers to meet a higher signature quota than if they submitted it 
to review. This seems to me to subvert the very idea of indirect initiatives, 
i.e., to involve the governor and the Legislature in the process. 
</P>
<P>
My initiative reform solution would require the involvement of the governor and 
Legislature on any ballot initiative for which at least half the required 
signatures had been gathered. The governor would be required to appoint a 
three-member commission to make recommendations to him within 60 days. The 
Legislature would then have 90 days to deal with the governor's 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
We have had a plethora of initiatives lately because the governor and the 
Legislature have failed to deal with pressing problems facing California 
residents. My proposal would involve them in the process. That's what they are 
paid to do. 
</P>
<P>
As The Times points out, the initiative process provides an important "safety 
value" for the people of California, but as important as this process is, it 
can and should be improved.

OUR WATER FUTURE CAN'T BE TIED UP 40 YEARS IN THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE MILLER, Rep. George Miller, a Democrat, represents the 7th District 
of California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty years ago, Harry Truman was President, Frank Sinatra was a teen idol, and 
no one had ever heard of Watchman, Walkman, or "rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
And 40 years ago, the federal government began selling water from its dams and 
reservoirs, permitting crops and cities to flourish where once only desert 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the departing Reaganites in the Department of the Interior, at the urging 
of subsidized farmers in California, want to return to that bygone era and to 
finance their fantasy with your tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '40s, Americans didn't worry much about inflation, environmental 
quality or toxic pollution. Little thought was given to public-works subsidies 
or the ecological damage that such projects might cause. Nor were our current 
concerns about droughts as pronounced, since the federal project appeared to 
provide more water than Californians could even anticipate consuming. 
</P>
<P>
In the decades since then, we discovered that we had been extremely 
shortsighted in much of our planning and forecasting. Congress and the states 
have enacted tough laws that require the thorough evaluation of the impact on 
environmental quality from public and private projects -- the environmental 
impact statements. Government agencies, like private entities, have learned to 
comply with the strict requirements of this process. 
</P>
<P>
But not the Bureau of Reclamation. Its recent history all too often reflects a 
disregard for the spirit of the law and a total indifference to the 
environment, which is the responsibility of its parent agency, the Department 
of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
Four decades ago, irrigators in the Friant Division of the federal Central 
Valley Project secured a 40-year contract for federal irrigation water, paying 
a fraction of the true costs of that water back to taxpayers. Friant's 
inflation-free contract is about to expire, and the growers are demanding that 
the bureau renew it for another 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
No one objects to continuing deliveries to Friant. But isn't it prudent, at 
least once every 40 years, to reevaluate the volume of water that the 
government commits when antiquated contracts expire? Isn't it appropriate, once 
every two generations, to ask some basic questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does Friant really need all the water it has been receiving, or could 
improved conservation and better management reduce the volume? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Given the enormous changes in the California population and economy over 
the next four decades, should irrevocable commitments of public resources be 
made through the year 2029? Should water contracts instead be for 10-year 
periods, or 20, to permit periodic reevaluation and modification? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What are the ecological consequences of the Friant deliveries? We have 
learned that irrigation in the Central Valley has produced an unanticipated 
ecological catastrophe at the Kesterson wildlife refuge; are there any negative 
impacts resulting from the Friant contract that, at least, ought to be 
identified and addressed as part of any contract renewal? 
</P>
<P>
 -- And might others in California -- more efficient irrigators, fish and 
wildlife, or urban users like those in Los Angeles -- make better use of a 
portion of the Friant supply? 
</P>
<P>
These, and other pertinent questions, could best be answered through completion 
of a thorough environmental review of the request for contract renewal. But in 
an extraordinary decision, the Department of Interior recently rejected the 
need for an environmental impact statement on the new Friant contract, arguing 
instead that the government must renew existing contracts -- not just as 
Friant, but throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, in effect, argues that in the case of Bureau of Reclamation water 
contracts, we who live in the late 1980s are bound by the decisions of those in 
the 1940s -- no questions asked. Forget the efforts to slash the federal 
deficit and public subsidies; forget the drought and the need to demand 
efficiency in water use; forget the growth in California and the changes that 
have occurred in agriculture over the last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The most outrageous aspect of the Interior Department's decision is not that we 
cannot order changes when necessary, but that public officials cannot even ask 
the prudent questions that should govern the commitment of public resources. 
How will the residents of Los Angeles, or Fresno, or Northern California 
respond when told that there is no more water for them, despite the expenditure 
of billions in tax dollars on developing additional supplies, because all the 
water was committed 40 years ago? 
</P>
<P>
Neither we in government, nor taxpayers, nor those who will invariably (and 
rightfully) sue to overturn the department's preposterous position should have 
to even raise these questions. It should go without saying that when a public 
agency has the opportunity to reevaluate a major policy decision 40 years after 
it was initiated, it should carefully review that decision in light of 
contemporary concerns. If the Interior Department's legal experts don't think 
so -- they should think again.

<P>
Variety Baby used the middle of the track to overtake favorite T.V. of Crystal 
and win the $82,800 La Brea Stakes by a half length Sunday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
The La Brea is the first of three races for 4-year-old fillies in the La Canada 
Series, which also includes the $100,000 El Encino Stakes, Jan. 21, and the 
$200,000-added La Canada Stakes, Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Variety Baby, ridden by Corey Black, came into the stretch four wide and wore 
down T.V. of Crystal in the final sixteenth. Sent off as second choice of the 
crowd of 34,606, Variety Baby covered the 7 furlongs in 1:21 3-5 and paid $7, 
$3.20, $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
T.V. of Crystal, ridden by Chris McCarron, paid $3.20 and $2.80. Forewarning, 
ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr., was another 4 1/2 lengths back in the field of 8 
and paid $4.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
Variety Baby, trained by Bruce Headley, earned $40,050 for owner and breeder, 
Kjell H. Qvale. 
</P>
<P>
The first 3 horses carried 117 pounds each.

Al Iafrate scored a power-play goal with 6:23 remaining in regulation time to 
give the Toronto Maple Leafs a 3-3 tie with the Blackhawks Sunday night at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto, which trailed 3-1 after two periods, got to within one goal at 9:45 of 
the third period when ex-Blackhawk Ed Olczyk banged his own rebound past 
replacement goaltender Ed Belfour for his 21st goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Belfour replaced Darren Pang 5:19 into the third period after Pang was injured 
during a goal-mouth scramble. 
</P>
<P>
Iafrate tied the game when he beat Belfour with a 40-foot slap shot at 13:37 
for his sixth goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago took a 2-0 lead on first-period goals by Wayne Presley and Dave Manson. 
Presley, who had not scored since Dec. 14, beat Toronto goaltender Ken Wregget 
to his glove side with a 25-foot slap shot from the left circle at 8:07, and 
Manson beat Wregget to the glove side with a 30-footer at 9:34 during a power 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Vancouver 0 -- Patrick Roy stopped 39 shots for his third shutout 
of the season as the Montreal Canadiens extended their winning streak to 8 
games with a win over the Canucks in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal, which has won 5 in a row on the road, has lost only once in its last 
14 games. The Canadiens lead second-place Boston by 21 points in the Adams 
Division.

NEWSWIRE: NYKANEN WINS SKI-JUMP LEG; THOMA FOURTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olympic triple gold medalist Matti Nykanen of Finland won the second leg of the 
traditional Four-Hill ski jumping tour by soaring 109 and 102 meters in his two 
jumps at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
West German Dieter Thoma, who won the first segment of the event in Oberstdorf 
two days earlier, managed only a fourth-place finish in the second leg but held 
on to his lead in both the Four-Hill tournament and the World Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
Thoma had jumps of 104.5 and 102.5 meters Sunday, trailing second-place 
finisher Jens Weissflog of East Germany and Finland's Risto Laakonen, who came 
in third. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Thoma swept down the track after his first jump, visibly 
angered that he had to land prematurely when a strong sidewind began pushing 
him wide of the track. 
</P>
<P>
Weissflog had jumps of 104 and 100 meters and Laakonen landed with 107.5 and 
99.5 in his two attempts, both earning more style points from the judges than 
did Thoma to finish ahead of the tournament leader.

A stagehands strike in Toronto forced cancellation of the National Ballet of 
Canada's last sold-out holiday performances last year of "The Nutcracker." Four 
matinee and evening performances of the traditional ballet and one of the 
farcical "Nutty Nutcracker" were canceled from Thursday to Saturday. "The union 
refuses to put stagehands on the job while mediation talks are in session," 
Charles Cutts, general manager of the O'Keefe Center, said in a statement. The 
O'Keefe's theater seats 3,000. The National Ballet has been performing the 
holiday favorite annually since 1964. The International Alliance of Theatrical 
Stage Employees' local and the center are in a dispute over the use of outside 
technical workers by touring productions. STEVE WEINSTEIN and DAVID CROOK

Actor Martin Sheen won a ruling Thursday from the Nevada Supreme Court 
overturning a requirement that he post a $5,000 bond aimed at stopping a 
protest trespass at the Nevada Test Site. Sheen, active in the movement against 
nuclear testing, was forced to post the "peace bond" after saying on national 
television he would "hopefully commit civil disobedience" at the test site. In 
reversing District Judge Bill Beko of Tonopah, the Supreme Court said in its 
2-page order that prosecutors conceded that civil disobedience isn't a crime in 
Nevada. STEVE WEINSTEIN and DAVID CROOK

MACAL LEADS PACIFIC SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With each guest conductor leading the Pacific Symphony while the search for a 
new music director goes on, the orchestra has responded with alertness and 
security. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee Symphony music director Zdenek Macal took his turn Saturday with a 
New Year's Eve pops program at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Macal is an interesting conductor to watch. He feints, he jabs, he flirts, he 
pouts, he argues, he suffers. He plucks notes out of the air. He directs 
finger-shimmies at the musicians. He crouches to half his height for the right 
pianissimo, rises to bring the music to a climax and finishes with little, 
happy jumping hops. He is capable of singing along with the players at the most 
expressive moments. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, the Pacific rarely gave him expressiveness to match, and it may 
not have been entirely the orchestra's fault. 
</P>
<P>
While always enforcing clarity, balance, proportion, exactness and discipline, 
Macal eschewed flights of lyricism or poetry. He could be fussy in detail, yet 
cool in overall aim and phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
The overtures to Strauss' "Die Fledermaus" and Offenbach's "Orpheus in the 
Underworld" were vigorous and clean, but not sweet or sparkling. Even 
Offenbach's famous cancan lacked a sense of fun. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor and pianist Jeffrey Siegel pretty much missed the style boat in 
Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue." Macal took a Teutonic, declamatory approach to 
the work, while Siegel viewed it as if he were playing Tchaikovsky's virtuosic 
First Concerto or perhaps one of Prokofiev's keen-edged works. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel stabbed at the sustaining pedal with his right foot, kept time by 
tapping with his left, thundered at the keyboard with steely facility and 
occasionally veered into honky-tonk style as if an inner voice suddenly nagged, 
"Jazz score . . . Jazz score. . . ." But it was a sometime thing. 
</P>
<P>
Macal enforced such rigid rhythms that when the big tune arrived, it sounded 
fatigued and oddly accented. Clarinetist Emily Bernstein, who in other works 
offered fine playing, proved tentative and inexpressive in the famous opening 
solo. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone came off best in the Suite from Strauss' "Der Rosenkavalier." The 
orchestra sounded strong and secure, and Macal conveyed sweep and power but 
only a little of the poignancy and intoxication of this magical score.

A provincial court in Egypt has ordered the television series "Falcon Crest" 
off the air on grounds it undermines public morals, according to a newspaper 
report. The newspaper Wafd, published by a centrist opposition party of the 
same name, said Thursday the ruling banning the show was in a provincial court 
in the Nile Valley town of Shibin el-Kom. "Falcon Crest" began appearing 
several years ago on local television and quickly became a favorite among both 
poor and wealthy Egyptians, despite its depiction of a society generally 
foreign to the mostly conservative Egyptians. Television censors, for example, 
routinely cut kissing scenes from "Falcon Crest" that they consider too 
passionate. The TV series "Dallas," a predecessor of "Falcon Crest," also was 
widely popular until it was stopped six years ago after a member of parliament 
complained it was corrupting the morals of Egyptian youth. STEVE WEINSTEIN and

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: DOCUMENTARY SERIES FOCUSES ON SOCIAL ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four feature-length documentaries on social and political issues will be shown 
over the next three weekends at the Monica 4-Plex. They will be screened 
Saturday and Sunday mornings simultaneously but with staggered starting times: 
Cathy Zheutlin's "Just One Step: The Great Peace March" (10:15), Martyn Burke's 
"Witnesses: Afghanistan -- The Untold Story" (10:30), Morley Markson's "Growing 
Up in America" (10:45) and Beverly Shaffer's "To a Safer Place" (11). 
</P>
<P>
All of them are worthy rather than dazzling efforts, and they all tend to pound 
out the points that their makers wish to make. 
</P>
<P>
The most affecting is "To a Safer Place," an occasionally awkward and 
self-conscious but rewarding study of Shirley Turcotte, a 36-year-old Vancouver 
phone company executive, wife and mother, who reveals her nightmarish 
childhood. From the time she was a toddler until she was at last able to escape 
to a foster home at 14, she was the victim of her brutal father's incest. By 
the time Turcotte was filmed she had already pretty much come to terms with her 
past and had become an activist in the prevention of child abuse; consequently, 
the film is more in the spirit of advocacy rather than self-discovery. Even so, 
her conversations with her family and even former neighbors are strong stuff, 
and the film makes clear the awful helplessness and guilt of the abused child. 
</P>

"Just One Step: The Great Peace March" captures the tremendously spiritual 
experience those 500 anti-war, anti-nuke protesters underwent in the course of 
their 1986 nine-month march from Los Angeles to Washington. Unfortunately, the 
film in its attempt to hammer home its message becomes repetitive and wearying 
long before the marchers reach the District of Columbia. There are some nifty 
moments along the way, however -- e.g., the elderly man who runs the Reagan 
Information Center in the President's hometown, Dixon, Ill., and who reasons 
that "more bombs make for more jobs." 
</P>
<P>
"Witnesses" is an illuminating, comprehensive and utterly relentless account of 
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, focusing on the incredibly brave, resilient 
and unyielding Afghans and a remarkable band of Westerners who are trying to 
come to their aid. This is a sobering, invaluable account of a war that has 
been called "Russia's Vietnam," but we're shown so much suffering that the film 
becomes numbing. 
</P>
<P>
On a lighter note "Growing Up in America" contrasts footage of a group of '60s 
radicals with contemporary interviews with them. Inevitably, there's Abbie 
Hoffman, who has kept the faith, Jerry Rubin, who thinks he has, even though 
he's become a Manhattan entrepreneur, and Allen Ginsberg, who remains 
wonderfully transcendent no matter how often he shows up in such documentaries. 
Of the 10 subjects attorney William Kunstler is by far the most incisive. While 
acknowledging that he has lived a good, fulfilling life he stresses that in 
regard to racism and other social ills, America has actually changed very 
little since the '60s.

As a curtain-raiser to its weekend morning New Chinese Cinema series, the Nuart 
is presenting Sunday and next Monday Xie Fei and U Lan's exquisite "Girl From 
Hunan," adapted from a 60-year-old classic novel by Shen Congwen that indicts 
the cruelty of child marriage. As it tells of the fate of a 16-year-old peasant 
girl, Xiao Xiao (Na Renhua), already married for four years to a boy a decade 
her junior, it exudes a sensuality that has been exceedingly rare in the 
Chinese cinema and has some nude scenes that are, in fact, regarded as a first. 
</P>
<P>
At first Xiao Xiao's life seems reasonably idyllic -- for one thing she somehow 
escaped having her feet bound -- but then she and a farmhand (Deng Xiaotung), 
too poor to afford a wife, become mutually attracted. Considering the zealous 
puritanism of their community the film concludes surprisingly (though not 
without irony). The film is set in 1910 but it might as well be antiquity, yet 
it's clear that its feminist sentiments are meant to reverberate in today's 
China. For full schedule: (213) 478-6379, 479-5269.

ISRAEL BANISHES 15 ARABS IN BID TO CURB UPRISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Israel on Sunday banished 15 Palestinians considered to be activist leaders of 
the Arab uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in an apparent 
challenge to the United States, which has condemned such actions in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The expulsions followed the close of one of the bloodiest months in the 
uprising, now nearly 13 months old. According to data compiled by an Israeli 
member of Parliament, Israeli soldiers shot and killed 31 Arabs during December 
and wounded another 400. 
</P>
<P>
More than 330 Palestinians have died during the uprising. Ten Israeli Jews and 
one Israeli Arab also have been killed. A total of 51 Arabs have been banished 
from the country during the intifada, as the uprising is called in Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flown to Lebanon 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army flew the 15 by helicopter to southern Lebanon, where they were 
each given $50 taxi fare, Israel Radio reported. The 15 then headed for an 
office of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical faction 
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the radio added. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Palestinians taken out of the country Sunday agreed to leave after 
giving up their court appeals in return for the right to come home in five 
years -- provided they refrain from taking part in "negative actions" against 
Israel. The rest refused the deal and are barred "for life." 
</P>
<P>
The banishment was "due to their involvement in the leadership of the uprising 
and the direction of it," an army spokesman declared. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has opposed expulsions as a violation of due process as well 
as of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids the removal of civilians 
from land under military occupation "for any reason whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
There was no reaction Sunday from the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian observers lashed out at the Israeli move. "The timing is 
atrocious," Palestinian lawyer Jonathan Kuttab said. "When people are beginning 
to talk solutions, talk peace, the Israelis create frustration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeals to U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Kuttab called on Washington to put some bite into its customary condemnation of 
the expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
The United States recently dropped a 13-year prohibition and opened contact 
with the PLO, to which most Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza owe their political 
loyalty. "The strength of the United States criticism of Israel will be a test 
of its intentions to foster peace," Kuttab argued. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the newly expelled Arabs played "leading roles" in the 
intifada and that most belonged to Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction headed by 
Yasser Arafat. Among the 15, the radio singled out four for special mention: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rizek Bayari, 29, a journalist who led popular committees in the northern 
Gaza Strip and was charged with "directing violence" in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Abdallah abu Samahadana, 38, a lecturer at Islamic University in Gaza. 
Samahadana spent four years in jail on charges of transporting hand grenades 
and was released last year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Massoud Zaefer, 42, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine who was a leader of the uprising in Nablus, the largest and most 
militant Palestinian city on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Abdel Hamid Baba, 25, a Fatah activist in the Amari refugee camp who is 
reported to be responsible for violence in Ramallah, a West Bank city north of 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources said that the expulsions, in the works since August, were 
timed to coincide with Sunday's 24th anniversary of the first PLO guerrilla 
operation inside Israel, observed by the Palestinians as "Fatah Day." The 
timing was a means of depressing Palestinian morale, the source said. In an 
attempt at showing its psychological impact, the official compared the action 
to a military raid Dec. 9 on a PLO faction's headquarters in Lebanon. That raid 
coincided with the first anniversary of the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Committees Targeted 
</P>
<P>
Removal of Palestinian leaders has been part of an Israeli effort to break the 
back of so-called popular committees that have spearheaded Arab resistance to 
Israeli rule in the occupied territories. Last August, Israeli authorities 
accused the 15 Palestinians of leading the committees in various localities and 
prepared the cases for expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, a Defense Ministry spokesman said the popular committees were 
designed "to impose by violent means the orders of the PLO and the uprising's 
leaders on the population, to undermine the Israeli authorities . . . and to 
create alternative mechanisms instead." 
</P>
<P>
The number of December clashes and the expulsions appeared to be a concrete 
sign of Israel's tough defiance of efforts in the international community to 
encourage peace talks by Israel with the PLO. Israel refuses to make contact 
with the organization, which it believes is unswervingly bent on destroying the 
Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials insist that peace talks with non-PLO Palestinians must be 
preceded by an end to the intifada. In the meantime, Israeli army officials 
have pledged to take the fight to stone-throwing youths in Arab towns and 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the Israeli army authorized occupying soldiers in the West Bank 
and Gaza to use so-called plastic bullets, whose lethal range is said to be 
less than that of full-metal projectiles. When the bullets were introduced, 
firing rules were relaxed; it no longer was necessary for a "life threatening" 
situation to arise before troops could shoot into crowds or at individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin predicted that the bullets would increase the 
number of wounded but reduce the number of dead. 
</P>
<P>
The prediction about fatalities is debatable. In the close quarters of Arab 
neighborhoods, the plastic bullets -- actually a blend of plastic and metal -- 
have proved as lethal as regular cartridges. In August, more than 20 Arabs were 
shot to death. The toll dipped in both September and October, climbed to 20 
again in November and surged to 31 in December. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 16, paratroopers based in Nablus shot and killed eight Palestinians 
during unrest that followed a funeral for an earlier victim -- the highest 
one-day fatal toll in a single city since the uprising began. Arabs have taken 
to calling the shootings "the Nablus massacre." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40 Killed in April 
</P>
<P>
The only month to top December in carnage was last April, when more than 40 
Palestinians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Yossi Sarid, a member of Israel's Parliament from the leftist 
Citizens' Rights Party, wrote to Defense Minister Rabin to protest the use of 
plastic bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"When Israel started using plastic bullets, the basic assumption was: They 
don't kill," Sarid said in an interview. "This evidently is not the case. The 
use of the bullets is intolerable. The death figures are horrible." 
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier, Israel's attorney general, Yosef Harish, said he would 
investigate the use of the bullets. His report would not be officially binding, 
but, as legal adviser to the government, his opinion might have some impact, 
Israeli observers say. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the army imposed a curfew on the entire Gaza Strip in an effort to 
prevent protests or violence connected to the PLO anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
During the day, at least five Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire, Arab 
sources said. The army reported that two teen-agers were shot in the legs when 
soldiers fired at dozens of stone-throwing youths in Ramallah, on the West 
Bank.

OVERCROWDED BRAZIL TOURIST SHIP SINKS OFF RIO; 51 DIE

A Brazilian excursion ship jammed with New Year's revelers bound for a 
fireworks display capsized and sank after ignoring an order to return to port, 
officials said Sunday. At least 51 people died. 
</P>
<P>
The sightseeing ship was carrying at least 131 people -- above its reported 
capacity of 100 -- and sank in 65 feet of water in Rio's Guanabara Bay about 
11:45 p.m. Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the exact cause of the sinking, but we think it was because of 
excess capacity," said Maj. Oldemiro Santos of the Fire Department's maritime 
group in Rio de Janeiro state. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said 51 bodies have been recovered and a search for survivors is 
continuing. Some passengers are believed trapped in the hull of the vessel, 
said Col. Jefferson Cardoso de Bem, chief of the maritime group. Among the dead 
was the boat's captain. 
</P>
<P>
The ship was so crowded that a naval vessel ordered it to return to port, but 
it ignored the order, said Irineu Barroso, chief of Rio's 10th police precinct. 
Some survivors confirmed that account, saying the ship had been stopped by 
officials and ordered to shore but that it set out a second time. 
</P>
<P>
De Bem said he had no accurate number of survivors or of the number missing 
because several boats took part in rescue attempts, and survivors were taken to 
hospitals throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
The boat, a popular tourist attraction that offers daily cruises of the bay, 
was to anchor in the Atlantic Ocean so passengers could view the midnight 
fireworks display at Copacabana Beach. The $220-per-ticket dinner cruise was 
heavily promoted in local newspapers and at tourist hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The double-decked ship Bateau Mouche sank between Sugar Loaf Mountain and a 
small island as it rounded the bend on the western side of Guanabara Bay near 
the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"The top deck was so crowded you could hardly move," a Brazilian woman told 
Brazil's TV Globo. "The boat was completely full, including lots of children. 
Then everything began shaking back and forth. People were shouting: 'It's going 
to flip over!' " 
</P>
<P>
Passenger Fabricio Calo, who was rescued by a fishing boat, said: "The boat was 
turning and shifting. Then tables started flying, glass started crashing, and 
the whole boat just turned over on its side." 
</P>
<P>
"This was not an accident," said one passenger, a business executive from Sao 
Paulo. "No effort was made to control the number of passengers who got on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Didn't Want to Go' 
</P>
<P>
Paulo Soares, 28, a brother-in-law of the Bateau Mouche's captain, Camilo da 
Costa, 50, said at the mooring station: "Camilo didn't want to go out. He said 
the boat was overloaded, and the sea was too rough. But he had no choice. He 
would lose his job if he didn't sail." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Sol e Mar restaurant, which organized the excursion, said 
at least 131 people were on board, according to an incomplete reservation list. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused further comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Rio newspaper O Globo reported Sunday that an American may have been on 
board. The U.S. Consulate said it was not authorized to give out any 
information about possible U.S. victims. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel capsized quickly, according to passenger Hans Leutner, 56. The West 
German said: "It was clear that the boat was overloaded. As it was going out, 
it was not very high in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"The boat tipped slightly to one side and did not come back," Leutner said. "In 
half a minute it had gone." 
</P>
<P>
On television, former Planning Minister Anibal Teixeira fought back tears as he 
spoke of the disaster in which his wife, Maria Jose Andrade Teixeira de Souza, 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Adam, 34, said she tugged an officer's shirt to ask: "Aren't we 
overloaded?" Adam, a French citizen, reported that he told her not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband Jean, 43, who once sailed with the French navy, said he didn't 
believe the flat-keeled boat was suitable for seagoing trips. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had been thrown into the sea and returned to the sinking ship for 
his wife, a poor swimmer. He failed to find her, but the two were reunited on 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
"She had the sort of luck you have only once in your life," Adam said. A 
passenger gave her a chair that she held onto until rescued by fishermen.

There's good news for people concerned about the spread of AIDS and widened 
drug use, but there's bad news for new-car dealers and shady travel promoters 
who like to cut corners to make a quick buck. Taking effect on New Year's Day 
were many of the 1,647 bills passed by the Legislature and signed into law by 
Gov. George Deukmejian during 1988. Here's a sampling of the new laws and what 
they do: 
</P>
<P>
AIDS 
</P>
<P>
Penalties -- Three additional years will be tacked onto the prison sentences of 
people convicted of certain sex crimes if they knew they were infected with the 
AIDS virus when they committed the crime. (SB 1007 by Sen. John Doolittle, 
R-Rocklin.) 
</P>
<P>
Confidentiality -- State law is loosened to allow physicians to tell other 
doctors, nurses and health workers if a patient has AIDS or has tested positive 
for the AIDS virus in order to permit them to take steps to protect themselves. 
(SB 2847 by Sen. Gary K. Hart, D-Santa Barbara.) 
</P>
<P>
Prostitutes -- It will be a felony for a prostitute to continue to work his or 
her trade after knowing he or she has been exposed to the AIDS virus. (SB 1007 
by Sen. John Doolittle, R-Rocklin.) 
</P>
<P>
Donors -- It will be a felony offense to donate blood, semen, breast milk or 
body organs to another person if the donor knows that he or she is infected 
with the AIDS virus. (SB 1002 by Sen. John Doolittle, R-Rocklin.) 
</P>
<P>
Cure Claims -- It will be a misdemeanor to advertise any unproven drug or 
device as a cure for AIDS. (AB 2936 by Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush, 
R-Saratoga.) 
</P>
<P>
Notice -- Doctors can inform the spouse, sexual partner or the needle-sharing 
partner of a patient who tests positive for AIDS without the patient's written 
consent after discussing the test results with the patient. (SB 2788 by Sen. 
Ken Maddy, R-Fresno.) 
</P>
<P>
Tests -- Doctors can test patients for the AIDS virus after obtaining oral 
rather than written consent of the patient and disclose the results in the 
official medical record. (AB 3255 by Assemblyman Bill Jones, R-Fresno.) 
</P>
<P>
Brochures -- The Department of Health Services will develop and distribute a 
brochure about AIDS to sexual assault victims. (AB 4209 by Assemblywoman 
Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
CRIME 
</P>
<P>
Rape -- Allows a rape victim in a court case to have up to two family members 
present in the courtroom for support purposes. (AB 4208 by Assemblywoman 
Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
Gang Intervention -- A $1-million pilot program is established in Los Angeles 
County to try to persuade elementary schoolchildren, by increasing their 
community involvement, that it's wiser not to join a gang. (AB 3723 by 
Assemblyman Richard Katz, D-Sepulveda.) 
</P>
<P>
Obscenity -- The legal definition of obscene matter is redefined in conformity 
with a U.S. Supreme Court decision to help make it easier to prosecute 
hard-core pornography peddlers in court. (SB 5 by Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh, D-Chula 
Vista.) 
</P>
<P>
Toy Guns -- Manufacture, sale or distribution of realistic-looking toy guns is 
outlawed with violations calling for possible $10,000 fines. It was prompted by 
an incident in which Los Angeles television personality David Horowitz was held 
hostage while on the air by a man brandishing a replica of a real pistol. (SB 
1795 by Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti, D-Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
Plastic Guns -- Manufacture, sale or possession of plastic guns not readily 
detectable by metal-screening devices or X-ray machines commonly used at 
airports is prohibited. (AB 4546 by Assemblyman Mike Roos, D-Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
Weapons -- A criminal penalty of up to one year in state prison is imposed for 
bringing a concealed weapon to a public meeting. (SB 1799 by Sen. Ruben S. 
Ayala, D-Chino.)

$50,000 for vandalism that causes more than $50,000 in damages. (AB 1086 by 
Assemblyman Bill Jones, R-Fresno.) 
</P>
<P>

established for candidates who run for sheriff. (SB 1356 by Sen. William 
Campbell, R-Hacienda Heights.) 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH 
</P>
<P>
Mental Health -- Counties can authorize an additional 30 days of involuntary 
psychiatric evaluation and treatment for people deemed to be a danger to 
themselves or others. (AB 2678 by Assemblywoman Doris Allen, R-Cypress.) 
</P>
<P>
Perinatal Care -- A $46-million appropriation will provide expanded perinatal 
care for low-income mothers and their infants during pregnancy and the first 
year of the baby's life. (SB 2579 by Sen. Marian Bergeson, R-Newport Beach.)

<TEXT>
<P>
Pope John Paul II on Sunday urged Christians and "all men of good will" to 
commit themselves to building peace and justice in the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope, observing the Roman Catholic Church's traditional "World Day of 
Peace," spoke from his Vatican apartment to 30,000 pilgrims and tourists massed 
in brilliant sunshine in St. Peter's Square for the noon Angelus prayer 
traditionally held on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Before the prayer, John Paul celebrated High Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, 
where he repeated his dedication to the rights of racial minorities in 1989 and 
the duty of governments to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
"The New Year that begins today is under the sign of the maternity of Maria, 
queen of peace, almost to signify a new hope, a renewed purpose," John Paul 
said in his address broadcast throughout the world by Vatican Radio. 
</P>
<P>
"If the forces of evil and hate insist in their destructive activity, we, the 
disciples of the Lord and of Mary, will insist still more, together with all 
men of good will, in the commitment to the building of peace and justice," the 
Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
At the High Mass, attended by some 10,000 pilgrims and diplomats accredited to 
the Holy See, John Paul prayed that "the face of the Lord" will rest upon the 
world in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
"We express the wish that it may be the year of peace, of justice and of 
growing solidarity, of social solicitude for each person and for everybody," 
the Pope said. "May peace, justice and solidarity grow in men and society. 
</P>
<P>
"May they grow and mature in human consciences, as also in the daily toil of 
conscience and willingness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope recalled that the Second Vatican Council, held in the 1960s, declared 
that "in all the nations of the Earth there exists a single people of God." 
</P>
<P>
"Precisely because of this, on this day the church thinks of all men of the 
entire planet, of all nations, in which each person finds his own human roots 
and his own identity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rights of Racial Minorities 
</P>
<P>
John Paul quoted excerpts from his message for World Peace Day, published by 
the Vatican on Dec. 9 and dedicated this year to the rights of racial 
minorities and the duty of all states to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
"Respect for minority groups should be considered, in some way, the touchstone 
for harmonious social coexistence and as an index of the civil maturity 
achieved by a country and its institutions," the Pope said, quoting from his 
message. 
</P>
<P>
"Guaranteeing the participation of minorities in public life is a sign of 
elevated civil progress, and this turns to the honor of those nations in which 
all citizens are guaranteed such participation in a climate of true liberty," 
he said.

<P>
Eleven Filipinos were killed and about 2,000 injured in firecracker blasts, 
stabbings and shootings during New Year's revelry, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said two people died in blazes sparked in Manila slums by firecracker 
explosions. Filipinos traditionally set off firecrackers and shoot guns into 
the air to usher in the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Philippines News Agency, quoting police officials in the 
capital, said the celebration was relatively peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital workers said five people were shot to death and 11 injured, most by 
stray bullets. Three men were stabbed to death and 14 reported hurt in drunken 
knife fights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killed by Bomb 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said a man died when a homemade bomb hurled at him exploded on 
his chest. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 people were taken to hospitals for cuts, burns and other blast 
injuries as well as stab wounds, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The firecracker blasts ignited blazes in six Manila districts. More than 14,000 
people were reported to have lost their homes in the fires and investigators 
put initial property damage estimates at about $2.4 million.

IZVESTIA SAYS A LIGHT-HEARTED GOODBY TO 1988

The newspaper Izvestia said goodby to 1988 with a good measure of humor Sunday, 
saying it hadn't been hard to give up one-candidate elections, jammed radio 
programs and other former staples of Soviet life abolished last year. 
</P>
<P>
The government newspaper toasted many changes made during 1988, including the 
improvement in supplies at liquor stores, which resulted from the Kremlin's 
realization that its crackdown on alcohol had created a massive network of 
moonshine distillers. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's raise our glasses to it (1988), because among other things it helped us 
get rid of the lines for this holiday drink," Izvestia's correspondent Yuri 
Makarov wrote in a rare bit of levity published in the central Soviet press. 
</P>
<P>
The article was headlined "Congratulations on the Old Year." 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the events of 1988, Izvestia said goodby to West German daredevil 
pilot Mathias Rust, who was allowed to return home in August after serving 14 
months of a four-year sentence for making an unauthorized landing in Red 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Madcap Inspector' 
</P>
<P>
"Auf wiedersehen Mathias Rust, madcap inspector of our anti-aircraft defenses," 
Izvestia said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper saluted the dramatic changes that took place in the Soviet Union 
last year as the country pursued Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
perestroika program of political and economic reform and his glasnost policy of 
openness. 
</P>
<P>
Many government bureaucrats were sent to work in industry as ministries were 
slashed or reduced, and multi-candidate elections to a new two-tiered 
Parliament were scheduled for 1989 as part of sweeping constitutional changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Farewell to the exciting election of one deputy from one candidate," Izvestia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We bade farewell to some officials who ruled our country. . . . We bade 
farewell to a number of ministries and branches despite their desire to stay 
on. How invincible and compulsory they seemed to be for many years!" 
</P>
<P>
Of the decision to stop jamming foreign radio broadcasts, Izvestia said 
tongue-in-cheek that it was difficult to abandon the belief that millions of 
dollars must be spent "to save our ears from the misinformation of foreign 
radios." 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia praised another new direction of glasnost taken in 1988 -- the end to 
the intentional distortion of maps. 
</P>
<P>
"It was also difficult for us to abandon the conviction that maps of our 
country are issued only to mislead foreign spies," the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Now better maps are being issued "and a precise map of Moscow can be bought not 
just in London." 
</P>
<P>
Places and institutions re-named after Leonid I. Brezhnev and Konstantin U. 
Chernenko, former Soviet leaders now officially linked with stagnation, resumed 
their old names last year -- another change praised by Izvestia. 
</P>
<P>
"We departed from the city of Brezhnev with a light heart," the newspaper said. 
The old name of the city on the Volga, Naberezhniye Chelny, was restored last 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"Goodby, 1988. You were a good year. But at the same time you were a difficult 
year, and frankly speaking, it is a good thing that you are leaving," Izvestia 
said.

KABUL, SOVIETS DECLARE CEASE-FIRE BUT REBELS ATTACK 2 VILLAGES

The Soviet-backed Afghan government began a cease-fire on New Year's Day, but 
U.S.-backed Muslim rebels rejected the truce and attacked government troops in 
two villages, Kabul Radio said. 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire offer was made Friday by Afghan President Najibullah, and the 
Soviet Union announced Saturday that its troops would join the truce. 
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to his nation Sunday, Najibullah complained that rebels 
have expanded operations against his government and repeated his offer of 
direct talks with them, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported. He also 
rejected any future Afghan government that excludes the present leadership, 
Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels recently opened talks with Soviet representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas attacked government troops Sunday in two villages in eastern 
Nangarahar province, Kabul Radio reported in a broadcast monitored in 
Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
The radio said eight guerrillas were killed and seven wounded in the attack on 
the military posts in Gushta and Deh Bala. It gave no casualty figures for 
government troops, but it said that soldiers launched mopping-up operations 
against the rebels after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Ahmad Shah said the cease-fire was "a condemnable suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
The seven-party Guerrilla Alliance named Shah head of a provisional Islamic 
government, that has yet to be installed. 
</P>
<P>
"It only shows how desperate Najib is," Shah said in a statement issued in 
Peshawar, Pakistan. "Najib has repeatedly proposed such meaningless 
cease-fires, but every time we rejected them." 
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Masood Khalili said of Najibullah's offer: "We did not start 
our fight because he asked us to. And we won't stop because he asked us to." 
</P>
<P>
Khalili belongs to the Jamaat-i-Islami guerrilla group. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 Soviet soldiers marched into Afghanistan in 1979 to help the 
Marxist government fight Muslim rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Half the Soviet troops left last year under the terms of a U.N.-brokered accord 
signed in Geneva by Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet 
Union. The rest of the Soviet troops are to withdraw by Feb. 15.

THATCHER SPURNS REVENGE IN JET BOMBING

<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher distanced herself on Sunday from U.S. vows to 
punish whoever planted the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth is ever valid," she said 
in a wide-ranging New Year's television interview. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing to do is to try to get the cooperation of all nations 
to track these people down so that they are brought to justice," she said on 
the "David Frost on Sunday" program. 
</P>
<P>
The danger of revenge, she said, is that "it can affect innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan said in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday that the United 
States would punish those responsible for the bomb, which brought the Boeing 
747 down in southern Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and at least 11 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said a report overseen by President-elect George Bush advocating 
possible military action against terrorists "ought to be giving some people 
sleepless nights" in the wake of the Dec. 21 bombing. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seek Hard, Punish Firmly' 
</P>
<P>
Bush vowed last week to "seek hard and punish firmly, decisively, those who did 
this, if you could ever find them." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher allowed Reagan to use U.S. bombers based in Britain to bomb Libya in 
1986 in retaliation for alleged Libyan involvement in international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
She said Sunday that no country should grant the Pan Am terrorists safe haven 
or permit them to escape justice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think public opinion is disgusted with nations that will not try to track 
down terrorists, absolutely disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say no group has offered a credible claim of responsibility for 
the attack. Speculation on suspects has focused mostly on Palestinian 
extremists and pro-Iranian Shia Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Celebrations 
</P>
<P>
Searchers in Lockerbie, Scotland, gave up their traditional New Year's 
celebrations Sunday to continue the hunt for bodies and wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that one more body, thought to be one of the missing local 
residents, was recovered, bringing the total to 242. 
</P>
<P>
Only 35 have been identified and released to relatives for burial. Capt. Bruce 
Smith, a Pan Am pilot whose English wife, Ingrid, was killed, was quoted in the 
Sunday Telegraph as saying the Scottish police were "paralyzed by inexperience 
and incompetence." 
</P>
<P>
John Boyd, chief constable of the Dumfries and Galloway police, replied at a 
news conference: "I am sure no one would thank me for shortcutting any legal or 
evidential gathering processes which may . . . help to bring the person or 
persons (responsible) to justice." 
</P>
<P>
More than 700 people are expected at a memorial service Wednesday in Lockerbie, 
and 1,000 more will watch on monitor screens in nearby halls. 
</P>
<P>
British newspapers reported Saturday that investigators believe the bomb was 
smuggled onto the flight in Frankfurt, possibly by a Lebanese-born passenger 
duped into carrying it. The West German government said no evidence supports 
those reports. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727 jet and switched to a 
Boeing 747 at London's Heathrow Airport for the trip to New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times of London said the bomb was loaded into the airplane's forward 
cargo hold next to the electronic nerve center that keeps the jet airborne.

DEMOLITION IS STOPPED ON HISTORIC MCKINLEY HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Italian Renaissance-styled McKinley Mansion, which is on Los Angeles' 
official list of historic-cultural monuments, was saved from the wrecker's ball 
over the weekend after a city building inspector arrived on the scene and 
declared that a demolition permit had been issued by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Contractors hired by owner Jason Lee had been at work an hour or more and did 
what could be thousands of dollars in damage before building inspector Michael 
D. Tharpe ordered them to stop demolishing the $4.5-million property at 301 S. 
Lafayette Park Place on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
By the time neighbors' complaints and police inquiries had brought out the 
building inspector, the wreckers had smashed the front patio superstructure, 
wrecked the adjacent arbors and made a number of gashes in the main part of the 
house, including exposing the wood frame on the southwest corner. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said Sunday that his contractors had obtained the demolition permit from 
the city Friday afternoon, and he believed that he was fully authorized to 
destroy the 13,000-square-foot house, built in 1917 and named for the late 
mortuary operator, Maytor H. McKinley. Lee wants to remove the house to make 
way for a 140-unit apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
However, an official of the Los Angeles Conservancy, Christy McAvoy, said a 
demolition permit cannot legitimately be issued, pending completion of an 
environmental impact report and exploration of alternative uses for the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"The owners were aware of that, but they evidently took advantage of the 
situation in the city offices on the eve of a holiday," she said. "The permits 
division may have been shorthanded. These properties are supposed to be clearly 
flagged in the city's files, however, so I really don't know how they got the 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very saddened by the owners' action. We had a substantial communication 
with them, and the situation had been fully explained to them. I'm deeply 
disappointed that they chose to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, who said he has owned the property for about seven months, said he had 
grown tired of waiting for the city to act and told his contractors this fall 
to see what they could do about getting a demolition permit. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the city's building inspector had told him he was stopping the 
demolition only until Tuesday, when the city would decide what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
Lee showed the permit his contractors had obtained to a reporter Sunday. He 
also displayed a city report saying that the Cultural Heritage Board had lifted 
a 180-day stay on issuing a demolition permit last March and said he knew 
nothing about any requirement for an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Present at the house Sunday was another man, Rod Daniels, a San Fernando Valley 
developer who said he has been seeking permission to move the house to 
Chatsworth and that he would like to live in it. It has also been proposed that 
the house be left where it is and used as an AIDS hospice.

A 6-year-old boy was killed and a 5-year-old girl critically injured Sunday 
afternoon by a hit-and-run driver whose car dragged them for nearly a 
half-block in Long Beach, police said. 
</P>
<P>
So Den Tang was killed and Anika Elk was in critical condition after the 
driver's older-model Lincoln Continental struck them as they crossed Alamitos 
Street at 17th Street about 3:30 p.m., Long Beach Police Lt. Craig Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
"He just kept on going after dragging them under his car," Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
The two children were taken to St. Mary Medical Center, where the boy died a 
short time later, he said.

TWO KILLED, WOMAN BADLY HURT IN NEW YEAR'S EVE PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man and a woman were killed and another woman critically injured in a New 
Year's Eve crash of a single-engine airplane in the snow-covered San Gabriel 
Mountains, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The plane is believed to have gone down about 5 p.m. Saturday, but a search 
team, hampered by snow and rain, took more than 16 hours to locate the 
wreckage, said Sgt. Tom Federoff of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were alerted to the crash by signals sent by the downed plane's 
emergency locater and searchers on Sunday morning found the crash site near Mt. 
Baldy. The two women were airlifted to Huntington Memorial Hospital in 
Pasadena, where one of them died at 11:30 a.m., a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The survivor, Jody Pierce, 25, of Santa Barbara, was in serious condition with 
abdominal and chest injuries and a fractured leg, nursing supervisor Judy 
Pruitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Federoff said the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and the Civil Air Patrol 
assisted in the rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department could not provide names of the other victims or 
details about the flight.

DANA POINT BECOMES A CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The seaside resort of Dana Point on Sunday officially became Orange County's 
28th city. 
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony aboard a replica of the brig Pilgrim, which carried 
19th-Century author and namesake Richard Henry Dana to what he called "the only 
romantic spot in California," Dana Point's City Council was sworn in and 
Councilwoman Judy Curreri was voted temporary mayor by her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
In a referendum June 7, three-quarters of the voters approved cityhood for the 
community of 26,000 between San Clemente and Laguna Beach. The new city 
includes the 393-room Ritz-Carlton Hotel, the 350-room Dana Point Resort and 
the planned 1,126-room Monarch Beach resort, which are expected to yield 
millions of dollars in hotel bed taxes. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant estimated that first-year revenues would be about $9 million -- 
more than enough to provide existing services. 
</P>
<P>
A cannon blast -- actually, a 12-gauge shotgun blank -- commemorated the birth 
of the municipality Sunday as a red Orange County Sheriff's Harbor Patrol boat 
chugged up the channel toward the ship, its sirens wailing and five jets of 
water spraying high.

The leader of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish 
Republican Army, criticized the IRA for killing civilians in a string of 
botched attacks in Northern Ireland in 1988. "I think the onus is on the IRA to 
safeguard the civilians from injury and death," Gerry Adams said in Belfast. In 
its traditional New Year message, the IRA conceded last week that 1988 had been 
a difficult year with many of its guerrillas killed and several attacks 
bungled. Among the victims killed in IRA bomb attacks intended for other 
targets were a family of three returning from a U.S. vacation, two men near a 
swimming pool and an elderly man and his granddaughter who were outside an 
unmanned police station.

Hundreds of dead birds found along a three-quarter mile stretch of country road 
near Austin, Tex., may have been poisoned by a pesticide or other chemical, a 
biologist said. Area residents first noticed the dead birds Saturday. Hundreds 
of birds were visible from the road, flapping on the ground or dangling from 
tree limbs. Hundreds more were dead in fields. The types included brown-headed 
cowbirds, Brewer's blackbirds, redwing blackbirds, Eastern meadowlarks, 
mourning doves, killdeer and a marsh hawk that died after feeding on a dying 
cowbird. Jack Ralph, a contaminants biologist with the Texas Parks and Wildlife 
Department, said he suspected poisoning, possibly from a type of herbicide, 
pesticide or related toxin. "As yet, we can't determine whether this is a 
natural or man-made event," Ralph said. He gathered several birds for 
laboratory analysis and said test results will be available in about a week.

House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said higher taxes probably will 
be part of a bipartisan compromise budget plan in 1989. Michel said he does not 
believe that spending can be cut enough to meet deficit limits set by law. "I 
don't know that there is that much flexibility," he said. "I suspect (tax 
increases) may be part of the answer." Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), on the other hand, said he takes at face value President-elect George 
Bush's stated opposition to a tax hike. Dole said: "I didn't coin the phrase 
'read my lips,' but I think (Bush) means it and I don't see any give in that 
area at this point." Michel and Dole were guests on ABC-TV's "This Week With 
David Brinkley."

A fire swept through a home north of Remer, Minn., killing eight children and 
two adults who were baby-sitting, authorities said. The fire spread so quickly 
it was unlikely that anyone woke up before being overcome by smoke, Remer Fire 
Chief Leo Renn said. The bodies were found still on the couches or beds where 
they were sleeping, he said. The victims in the two-story wooden home included 
four children of the owners, John Watson and his wife, Nancy, who were not at 
home. The names of the victims were not immediately released. Renn said a 
wood-burning stove and a fuel-oil space heater were being investigated as 
possible causes. In Anchorage, Alaska, two adults and two children died in an 
early morning blaze in a trailer house. They were not immediately identified.

Members of a small Oakland church have bought a neighboring motel plagued with 
prostitution and drug dealing and plan to reopen it as a low-cost apartment 
house. The Rev. George Epps, pastor of the Greater Emmanuel Missionary Baptist 
Church, said a nonprofit corporation formed by the church paid $550,000 for the 
property with the help of a redevelopment loan from the city. "We saw this as a 
great opportunity to try to get in there and make a change," Epps said. The 
300-member congregation plans to first overhaul the motel's 22 units.

GREEKS HAVE A WORD -- SATIRE -- FOR PAPANDREOU'S LOVE AFFAIR

Politics and sex, the mix that has rocked Greek theater for 2,400 years, is 
finding new life in satirical shows that mock Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou 
and his relationship with a former flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
Greeks are packing the capital's theaters to laugh at satires of the 
69-year-old Socialist premier, who is carrying on a public relationship with 
34-year-old Dimitra Liani while his governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement is 
besieged by financial scandals. 
</P>
<P>
Public affairs -- sexual and political -- have been favorite topics for Greek 
comedians since the playwright Aristophanes made the combination a smash hit in 
the 5th Century BC. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou's heart operation in London last September inspired the title of a 
popular revue, "Post-Aorta Greece," written and directed by Lakis Lazopoulos, 
Greece's top satirist. 
</P>
<P>
Lazopoulos asks innocently at each show: "If a newcomer to Athens saw Andreas 
and Dimitra walking and holding hands, what would he think?" 
</P>
<P>
"That there's a nice girl helping an old man cross the street," comes the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Vembo Theater a giant poster of Papandreou and Liani embracing 
advertises "Little Dimitra's Sweetheart," a take-off of a classic Greek 
folklore play, "The Little Shepherdess's Sweetheart." 
</P>
<P>
In the show, an Athens housewife is asked whether the prime minister's 
pre-election pledges of political and social change have been fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
"Andreas has made one change OK. He changed his American woman for a Greek," 
she answers as the audience breaks into enthusiastic applause. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, Papandreou said he will divorce his 66-year-old American-born 
wife Margaret, but no proceedings have yet been started. The blonde Liani has 
been divorced twice. 
</P>
<P>
Six political revues are playing over the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
According to box-office figures, the shows are grossing up to $37,500 a week, 
twice as much as the most successful drama in Athens.

ARE YOU ALLERGIC TO YOUR WORK? SOME FOLKS ARE, DOCTORS SAY

 What job hazard might a baker, dentist and bartender share? Exposure to 
allergens that make them sneeze, wheeze or break out in a rash. 
</P>
<P>
When choosing careers, few people consider whether they may be allergic to 
materials found at the workplace. But many on-the-job substances -- ranging 
from rubber gloves to celery -- can trigger allergic reactions that make 
workers' lives uncomfortable, if not downright miserable. 
</P>
<P>
"Work-related allergies are often misdiagnosed. Only in the last 10 years have 
they started to be taken seriously," Dr. Robert Adams, a dermatology professor 
at Stanford University, said at a recent seminar. 
</P>
<P>
Among the workers at particular risk for developing job-linked allergies are 
bakers. The problem is so widespread that wheezing caused by allergic reactions 
to flour and other baking ingredients has been dubbed "baker's asthma." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to breathing difficulties, Adams said, bakers may develop skin 
rashes from exposure to dough, molasses, preservatives and certain flavorings 
and spices, particularly cinnamon. 
</P>
<P>
Although not all skin problems stem from allergies, many do. That is 
significant in light of federal findings that skin disorders account for a 
third of all cases of chronic occupational disease. The annual cost of lost 
work time, medical care and disability payments related to skin disorders is 
estimated to be at least $222 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bartenders often are plagued by the allergic skin reactions "extremely common 
among people who do wet work," Adams said. Possible allergens for those who 
earn their living mixing drinks are lemon juice, aromatic bitters, glass 
cleaner and rubber gloves. 
</P>
<P>
Rubber gloves are an allergy source for a wide variety of workers, including 
doctors, dentists, butchers, dairymen and kitchen employees. The threat of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and hepatitis has also prompted paramedics, 
firefighters and police officers to don gloves. 
</P>
<P>
"A common reaction (to rubber gloves) is a hive-like condition on the hands 
known as contact urticaria, which causes severe itching," said Adams, noting 
that hypo-allergenic and plastic gloves are available for people sensitive to 
chemicals in regular gloves. 
</P>
<P>
Even people who work in office environments cannot evade job-related allergies. 
</P>
<P>
University of Iowa doctors recently reported cases of clerical workers 
developing potentially life-threatening allergic reactions to carbonless copy 
paper. The researchers found that the resin used in such paper can trigger 
rashes, shortness of breath and swelling of the throat. 
</P>
<P>
Allergens also lurk in the florist's shop. The American Academy of Dermatology 
reports that alstroemeria, a bell-shaped flower commonly used in arrangements 
because it stays fresh so long, can cause severe, disabling skin reactions in 
floral workers. The ever-popular primrose can also cause rashes.

<P>
A test that tells a woman when she can have sex without using artificial birth 
control to avoid pregnancy has been developed by a biotechnology company that 
said it will be at least a year before it gains regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
Monoclonal Antibodies of Mountain View, Calif., has released details about the 
test, which it said provides valid results only during the second half of a 
woman's monthly cycle, after ovulation. 
</P>
<P>
The test, which Monoclonal said will sell for $3 to $5 per test when it is 
eventually marketed, measures progesterone levels to tell women when ovulation 
has happened. When the hormone level is high, it indicates that ovulation has 
taken place and conception is no longer possible. The test involves putting a 
spot of urine on a pad. If the progesterone level is high, the sample shows no 
color. If the test sample turns blue, a woman would be liable to become 
pregnant.

TREATMENT EFFECTIVE AGAINST BREAST CANCER

<P>
The combined results of 61 studies involving nearly 29,000 women establish 
"beyond reasonable doubt" that drug and hormone treatment after surgery can 
save the lives of many victims of early breast cancer, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis shows that during the five years after treatment begins, a 
synthetic hormone called tamoxifen reduces the odds of death among older women 
by about one-fifth. For women under age 50, a combination of chemotherapy drugs 
reduces the odds by about one-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. I. Craig Henderson of the Dana-Farber Cancer Center in Boston, one of 79 
co-authors of the report last week's New England Journal of Medicine, said that 
the treatments do not necessarily cure these women but "substantially delay 
death." 
</P>
<P>
National Institutes of Health recommended in 1985 that tamoxifen and 
chemotherapy be used for breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes. In 
May, 1988, the National Cancer Institute told doctors that this treatment could 
be extended to women in the earliest stages of breast cancer that is not yet 
evident in the lymph nodes. The institute based its recommendation on three 
unpublished studies showing that cancer was slower to return when these women 
were treated after surgery.

In an effort to allay public fear that medical residents are working too many 
hours and providing inadequate patient care in hospitals, an ad hoc committee 
organized by the University of California has recommended that the state's five 
public and three private medical schools restrict doctors in training to no 
more than 84 hours of work per week. The recommendations are in stark contrast 
to current practices of allowing young physicians, particularly obstetricians 
and surgeons, to work round the clock without sleep for upwards of 90 or 100 
hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
The California plan for reform, however, is in keeping with those of a number 
of other efforts around the country to make medical residency training less 
stressful and to improve hospital care of patients. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for California, and one the UC committee did not address, is how to 
pay for the additional personnel that would be needed to implement such a plan. 
According to the committee's own estimates, to replace residents with 
additional residents, nurses, or trained physicians could cost anywhere from 
$26 million to $190 million a year.

What Napoleon learned in Russia, another macho little general named Jerry 
Glanville learned again on the steppes of the Niagara Frontier: 
</P>
<P>
It's tough out here in winter. 
</P>
<P>
Where was the old Oiler fire? 
</P>
<P>
Those high elbows? 
</P>
<P>
Those late hits? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that twin bill they just split on the tundra of Cleveland took it out of 
them? At any rate, it was a subdued Oiler team that showed up here Sunday and 
lost, 17-10, to the Bills in a ho-hum American Football Conference semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills advance to next week's AFC final at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers? Once again, they're the contender that came in from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately a very good football team isn't going to play anymore," said 
Glanville, his voice little more than a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, his very good football team lost a late season game at home to 
the Pittsburgh Steelers, blew a 23-7 lead at Cleveland in the regular-season 
finale and lost its chance to welcome the playoffs to the House of Pain. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Oilers upset the Browns last week and were competing on even terms 
Sunday until another of their vintage flourishes backfired. Last season in 
Denver, it was Stagger Lee, the lateral pass they threw into the end zone that 
became a game-turning fumble. Sunday, it was a third-quarter option on third 
and 1 at the Buffalo 2-yard line in a 7-3 game that became a wild pitchout . . 
. and then a missed field-goal try. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," said Glanville softly, "we felt it would score. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent a guy in motion, they followed him and they had one guy to take two. 
That's what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
The question, as always, remains, if the Oilers are so big and talented, why 
not just forget about the tricks and play football? 
</P>
<P>
"The option has been very good for us," Glanville said. "It's what we do down 
there. It's how we score." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, well, win some, lose some. The Oilers played last week, and the Bills 
rested . . . and plotted. 
</P>
<P>
Had the Bills been going backward for a month? 
</P>
<P>
Losing three of their last four? 
</P>
<P>
Getting out-rushed in three of their last four? 
</P>
<P>
Sunday -- surprise! -- the arch-conservative Marv Levy let his hamstrung 
prodigy, Jim Kelly, come out firing and Kelly's pulse danced. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills passed on 15 of their first 21 first downs . . . and Kelly went 11 
for 15. 
</P>
<P>
Was Kelly happy, or what? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, definitely," he said. "I was a throwing quarterback coming out of the 
USFL. I love to throw the ball. That's why I'm a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"At times during the season, we ran the ball extremely well, so we didn't throw 
it. Our defense played so well, our offense kind of took a back seat, but we 
were No. 4 in total offense. I think that speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
However, Levy was having a little trouble himself, guessing right on calls near 
the Oiler goal. 
</P>
<P>
It was 0-0 when Kelly talked him into going on fourth and 1 at the Houston 3 in 
the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly threw an incomplete pass. 
</P>
<P>
Levy and Kelly were going to guess wrong again later, but not before the Bills 
took the lead. Early in the second period, Leonard Smith blocked an Oiler punt 
by Greg Montgomery and the Bills took over at the Oiler 46. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly promptly threw a couple of first-down passes to Trumaine Johnson for 18 
and 9 yards. Then Thurman Thomas broke free over the right side for 16 to the 
Oiler 3. A couple of plays later, Robb Riddick jammed over from the 1 -- after 
Kelly fell down handing off and Riddick bobbled the ball and guard Jim Ritcher 
blocked Eugene Seale, who had stacked up Riddick at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills were still clinging to a 7-3 lead when Kelly came out firing in the 
second half . . . and drilled one into the chest of Oiler nickel back Tracey 
Eaton at the Buffalo 47. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, the Oilers were at the Buffalo 2, with third and 1. 
</P>
<P>
Where to run? 
</P>
<P>
Off the left side behind 320-pound Bruce Davis and Pro Bowl choice Mike 
Munchak? 
</P>
<P>
Off the right behind Pro Bowl selection Bruce Matthews and blue-chip No. 1 pick 
Dean Steinkuhler? 
</P>
<P>
How about around right end, where quarterback Warren Moon would have to make a 
read, risk injury if he turned it up, or get the ball out to his trailing back, 
Mike Rozier? 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers chose the option. Moon may have made a bad read, and he certainly 
made a bad pitchout. Rozier never touched it, and it rolled over the sideline 
for a 12-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Zendejas then came out to try a 31-yard field goal . . . and duck-hooked 
it, and the Oilers had nothing to show for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"It kinda slipped out of my hand and got away from me," Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a matter of either me taking it into the end zone or Mike. I'm not 
sure, they said from upstairs that I might have made it myself. I didn't think 
I could." 
</P>
<P>
Why not run straight ahead? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I've got 5 TDs running the option this year," Moon said, "and our backs 
have scored more. We're going to do the things that got us here. We can't throw 
it out now." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers use a lot of the old USFL: Houston Gamblers/Jim Kelly/Mouse Davis 
run 'n' shoot, and the option, too, which may be imaginative of them. The 
argument against the latter, on the pro level, is that defenses will try to 
take out your quarterback, and if they do, it won't be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Moon threw for 195 yards in the first half, and 45 in the second. Why? 
He had come into the game with a sore right elbow and injured it again -- 
running an option. 
</P>
<P>
Let's just say that when Zendejas missed, the air went out of the Oilers with a 
whoosh you could hear on the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Each defense held twice. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills then put together a 59-yard drive, including Kelly's first-down pass 
to Chris Burkett for 26 yards, and a third-down Kelly scramble with a face-mask 
penalty against ex-Raider Sean Jones tacked on. Thomas bolted the last 11 yards 
off the right side, and it was 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been 17-3 early in the fourth period after Kelly completed a 
53-yard pass play to Andre Reed. However, Kelly talked Levy into trying to go 
again on fourth and 1 at the 1, and Riddick was thrown back, again. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, it's the playoffs, let's go for it," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
"I said that to him twice, and we came up short twice. The second time, I 
apologized to him." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't have to worry, this wasn't the Oilers' day. Moon promptly threw an 
interception to Mark Kelso, who returned it 28 yards to the Houston 18. 
</P>
<P>
This time, when the Bills got to fourth and 1 at the Houston 9, Levy sent out 
his field goal unit. Scott Norwood kicked the 27-yarder and it was, finally, 
17-3. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Oilers have anything left? Moon took them 80 yards, completing passes 
for 65 yards of the drive. Rozier ran straight ahead this time and went over 
from the 1 with 5:12 left, making it 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers even got the ball back . . . briefly. 
</P>
<P>
They forced a punt, but Curtis Duncan came running up to field a line drive by 
John Kidd, bobbled the ball, went to one knee, got up and tried to run before 
he was hit by ex-Oiler Steve Tasker and fumbled the ball to the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills ran out the clock as the fans sang and threw their last snowballs at 
the Oilers and the police on horseback, 22 years of pent-up yearnings fulfilled 
at last. The Bills hadn't played a home playoff game since 1966, when the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development-designate, Jack Kemp, who was 
watching upstairs, was the quarterback, and they were teeing it up in a 
downtown pile of bricks called War Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerry Glanville's heart, it may have been wintertime, but it's summer in 
Buffalo.

QUARTERBACK HAS BIG DAY; 49ERS ROUT VIKINGS, 34-9

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year after suffering his most painful pull outside of a dentist's office, 
quarterback Joe Montana was removed from the starting lineup again Sunday, sent 
to the bench with 8 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Same place, same playoff opponent, same stakes. But hardly the same ol' Joe. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the 32-year-old Montana left as conquering hero, having played a 
game with the hunger of a man who hadn't thrown a playoff touchdown pass in 4 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Montana hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
But those ghosts, along with others, were finally purged from the souls of the 
San Francisco 49ers, who snapped a 3-year, first-game playoff losing streak 
with a 34-9 win over the Minnesota Vikings to advance to next week's NFC title 
game against the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, who would throw his first postseason scoring pass since Super Bowl 
XIX, played brilliantly early and made it stand up. Montana finished with 
scoring passes of 2, 4 and 11 yards -- all to receiver Jerry Rice, all in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
A more complete reversal of last season's loss to the Vikings is difficult to 
imagine. 
</P>
<P>
It was here at Candlestick Park that Montana was breaded and deep fried in a 
playoff loss a season ago, a humbling performance that led to his second-half 
benching and the dawning of a new-age quarterback controversy with Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, before a crowd of 61,848, Montana left the game only after his work was 
done, his good name and a game's outcome having long been satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not that the 49ers were sensitive about their little run of bad luck 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"The past 3 years have been glorious years," Coach Bill Walsh said, responding 
to a pointed question afterward. "I don't know where you're from. We've been to 
the playoffs every year. We haven't won the Super Bowl in 4 years. People will 
look at the negative side about that. But what other team has done more than we 
have? We have no apologies for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Especially not after Sunday, when the 49ers reversed virtually every trend from 
last season's Vikings loss. 
</P>
<P>
None was more important than the elimination of Anthony Carter from the 
Vikings' game plan. Last time, Carter cut through the 49er secondary for a 
playoff-record 227 yards with 10 catches. Sunday, Carter did not have ball 
thrown his direction in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
He made his first catch with 13:21 left in the third quarter and finished with 
3 catches for 45 yards. Viking quarterback Wade Wilson threw Carter's way just 
5 times all day. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Tim McKyer, who admitted he and the boys did a pretty nice 
double-coverage blanket job on Carter, still couldn't believe the Vikings 
didn't take a chance on their home-run king. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what their game plan was," McKyer said. "But I know if I was the 
coach, I would throw him the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, for example, don't seem to mind how many people are covering Rice. 
Great receivers make great catches, they figure. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, of course, has been through this before with his coaching staff and 
wasn't pleased with his snubbing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Viking Coach Jerry Burns said the 49ers' heavy pass rush and double coverage 
took Carter out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't do anything differently," Burns snapped later. "They just did it a 
hell of a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Carter basically said that Burns took him out of the game. And for Carter, 
those lonely pass routes were tough pills to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
Double coverage? 
</P>
<P>
"That's not what I saw," he said. "I saw a lot of zone. They just didn't call 
my number." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Viking coaches can reach Carter at home. 
</P>
<P>
It was true, though, the 49ers' defensive front put an excessive amount of heat 
on Wilson, who sometimes had trouble getting the ball out of his own hand, let 
alone to his receivers. Wilson was sacked 6 times on the day for minus-47 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we didn't sack him today, we wanted to be in his face and get a hand 
up," 49er defensive end Larry Roberts said. "By keeping a lot of pressure on 
Wilson and playing AC (Carter) up tight, we knew we pretty much had them where 
we wanted them." 
</P>
<P>
And that, of course, was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side, San Francisco's offensive line protected Montana well, much 
better than last season when the Vikings sacked him 4 times. Sunday, Montana 
was sacked once. 
</P>
<P>
Against the likes of Keith Millard and Chris Doleman and the rest of 
Minnesota's No. 1-ranked defense, that was big news. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive line had a great day," Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Millard, twice called for offsides, grew more frustrated as 
the day wore on. After Roger Craig's 4-yard run put the 49ers up, 28-9, with 
13:41 left, Millard sauntered over and took a shot at Montana's jaw. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, certainly not foolish enough to exchange blows, instead wagged his 
finger at Millard as he ran off the field. Millard, of course, wagged back. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just the heat-of-the-moment-type thing," Montana said. "I was just 
congratulating my offensive line and got an elbow across my face." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Millard's face was stained only with egg. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, whose mobility this season has been hampered by various injuries, 
seemed strong and sharp Sunday, especially in the first half, when he completed 
11 of 14 passes for 111 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Things might have been worse had the Vikings not squandered a nice 6-minute, 
12-play drive on their opening drive, settling for a 47-yard Chuck Nelson field 
goal. Minnesota's only lead of the day, 3-0, would last just minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Montana drove the 49ers 48 yards late in the quarter before finding Rice open 
for a 2-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
Nine seconds later, 49er safety Ronnie Lott intercepted a Wilson pass intended 
for Darrin Nelson, returning it 5 yards to the Minnesota 30. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-yard reverse run by Rice took it down to the 9, setting up a 4-yard 
touchdown pass play, Montana to Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the half, after the 49ers had driven 59 yards down to the 11, Montana 
faked right and looked left to Rice, who froze Viking corner Reggie Rutland 
with an inside move. Rice went outside. Touchdown and 21-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings only made a game of it twice. On their first possession of the 
third quarter, they finally discovered Carter hit him twice on pass plays of 21 
and 14 yards to set up a 5-yard scoring pass from Wilson to Hassan Jones. 
Nelson missed the extra point, cutting the lead to 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
The play that turned the game came with 2:26 left in the third quarter. 
Rutland, anticipating a Montana pass to Rice in the left flat, cut in front of 
the receiver at his own 40 and seemed in perfect position to make the 
interception and take it 60 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"We both had the ball in our hands," Rutland said, describing the play. "We 
came down with it." 
</P>
<P>
The ball, in fact, went past Rutland's fingertips into the hands of Rice, who 
turned it into a 28-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
In last season's game, Rutland took a similar gamble and returned a Montana 
interception 45 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
As Rutland would say, there were many things different about this game. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have went either way," Rutland said. "In another situation, it might 
have been different. I'd play it the same way each time. I'd just come down 
with it each time." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a 21-16 game, Rice's catch set up the touchdown that put the 49ers 
up, 28-9. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig removed all comeback doubts when he turned a simple pitch into an 
80-yard touchdown run with 9:04 left. It was the longest run of Craig's career 
and the longest day in recent Viking memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, that run was by design," Walsh said of Craig's run. "It 
broke like we had hoped. But after the first 5 yards, it was all Roger." 
</P>
<P>
Craig, who had been mostly frustrated until his big run, finished with 135 
yards in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Young replaced Montana with 7:46 remaining. Redemption was sweet, Montana would 
say. And complete.

THE BOWL GAMES; 
</P>
<P>
ROSE BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
SCHEMBECHLER COULD USE LAST LAUGH AGAINST USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler is reminded of his 1-7 record in the 
Rose Bowl, which is often, he jokes about it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a logical response, because he can't do anything now about what has 
happened in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his lighthearted comments, Schembechler would like to start 
chipping away at his record by beating USC today in the 75th renewal of the 
Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith doesn't have such skeletons rattling in his coaching 
closet. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, there is a certain urgency for Smith to win today's game, 
considering that his Trojans lost to Michigan State in last year's Rose Bowl 
game in his first appearance as a head coach. It would also take some of the 
sting out of a regular-season ending loss to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
That defeat ranks as one of the most disappointing in 100 years of USC 
football. If USC (10-1) had won, it would be defending a No. 1 ranking in 
college football against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
USC quarterback Rodney Peete has said that it will be a long time before that 
defeat is little more than a memory. 
</P>
<P>
So how will the Trojans respond? Smith isn't sure. "We won't know until we come 
out on the field. We haven't been able to judge ourselves in that situation 
because it's the first time we've come off a loss this season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Michigan (8-2-1), the Wolverines could be a national championship 
contender today if it weren't for early season losses to Notre Dame and Miami 
by a total of 3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written that the USC-Michigan matchup is a secondary bowl game, 
inasmuch as No. 1-ranked Notre Dame and No. 3 West Virginia will be playing for 
the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Schembechler and Smith contend that the "Granddaddy of them 
all," the Rose Bowl, doesn't take a back seat in viewing interest to any bowl. 
Subsequent television ratings will provide more insight. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, today's Rose Bowl game has its intrinsic interest -- 
Schembechler's albatross-like record along with the Big Ten's failure here in 
recent years, losing 12 of the past 14 Rose Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there's the relationship between the coaches. Smith got his coaching 
start as a member of Schembechler's staff at Miami of Ohio and Michigan in the 
late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
They've been friends ever since, and Smith attributes much of his coaching 
philosophy to his early apprenticeship under Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has lost only 5 games and won 18 in 2 seasons at USC. In those losses, 
Trojan turnovers were decisive. Smith says they will be a key factor today. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan isn't likely to oblige, considering that quarterbacks Michael Taylor 
and Demetrius Brown have thrown only 2 interceptions and have lost only 8 
fumbles the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
With the notable exception of the Notre Dame game when USC had 4 turnovers, the 
Trojans haven't been error-prone. 
</P>
<P>
Peete has thrown 10 interceptions, but that's misleading, considering his 
entire offensive output. He has completed 208 of 338 passes (61.5%) for an 
average of 241.3 yards a game and 18 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Michigan's quarterbacks have attempted only 191 passes. The 
Wolverines are primarily a running team, featuring tailback Tony Boles and 
fullback Leroy Hoard, who are each averaging 5.5 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
"Michigan will not be taken out of its running game," Smith said. "They're 
better at it than any team we've played." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Wolverines may be forced to pass more often than in previous games 
considering the Trojans are No. 2-ranked nationally in rushing defense, 
allowing an average of only 76.6 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
USC has a more balanced offense, averaging 214.6 yards running and 247 yards 
passing compared with 256.6 and 153.4 for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams have what Smith calls bend-but-not-break defenses. Michigan features 
one of the nation's best defensive linemen in tackle Mark Messner. 
</P>
<P>
However, Peete, who placed second to Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders in the 
Heisman Trophy voting, seemingly provides USC with an edge in an otherwise even 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
Brown became the starting quarterback when Taylor suffered a broken collarbone 
in the ninth game of the season against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Brown had 16 interceptions last season, a factor in losing his starting job to 
Taylor. However, he hasn't been intercepted since replacing Taylor, completing 
61.7% of his passes for 5 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
It's Brown's show today as Taylor was recently hospitalized with the flu and 
isn't expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines are aware of Peete's capabilities. Said Messner: "He's very, 
very fast and he can beat you single-handedly." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame had some success blitzing Peete in a 27-10 victory, and it wouldn't 
be surprising if Michigan uses the same tactic. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines don't seem to be up-tight, perhaps reflecting the mood of their 
coach, who has been accommodating and apparently relaxed since the team's 
arrival here. 
</P>
<P>
As for his 1-7 Rose Bowl record, Schembechler, who has won more games than any 
other active college coach, dismisses it by saying: 
</P>
<P>
"If you win all the time, maybe you don't have as much appreciation for it. The 
thing that has balanced out my career is the fact I haven't been as successful 
in bowls. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had the same record I had in bowls as I do in the regular season, I'd 
probably be too cocky and have too big an ego." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rose Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kickoff for today's game is 2 p.m. A crowd of 95,000 to 100,000 is expected. . 
. . USC is a 6 1/2-point favorite. Even though Aaron Emanuel has been USC's 
most productive tailback in recent games, Coach Larry Smith said that Ricky 
Ervins would start today. "He has had excellent practices," Smith said of 
Ervins, "but all of our tailbacks will play." He was mainly referring to 
Ervins, Emanuel and Scott Lockwood. Smith would also like to use Steven Webster 
if possible. Webster, a senior, has missed virtually the entire season with 
injuries. . . . Michigan's Wilbur Odom, a sophomore, who has played in only one 
game, will back up Demetrius Brown at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
USC is ranked fifth in the polls, Michigan 11th. . . . Smith concedes that 
Michigan has an edge over USC in the kicking game. Mike Gillette, a catcher on 
the baseball team, is averaging 40.4 yards on punts. He set a school record 
with his 56-yard field goal against Ohio State. USC punter Chris Sperle is 
averaging 38.3 yards, and Quin Rodriguez made 14 of 19 field goals, 7 for 7 
inside the 30-yard line. . . . Erik Affholter, USC's All-American split end, 
set schools records in the regular season for receptions in a season (63) and 
career (118). Michigan has accomplished wide receivers in Greg McMurtry, Chris 
Calloway and John Kolesar. However, that group has had a total of only 67 
receptions on a run-oriented team. 
</P>
<P>
T.J. Osman, Michigan's middle guard, on Bo Schembechler's overall 4-11 bowl 
record: "He told us before we left that if we got a question about his bowl 
record to answer by saying that it's his record and not anything that we had to 
do with." . . . Asked to comment on Michigan allowing 31 points against Ohio 
State in the second half of a final regular-season game, defensive tackle Mark 
Messner said: "We're still asking what happened. We had the same players and we 
were calling the same defenses, but they were going right through us." Michigan 
won, though, 34-31, on a late, 41-yard pass from Brown to Kolesar. Michigan is 
ranked ninth nationally in scoring defense, allowing an average of 13.9 points 
a game. . . . USC has a 3-1 record against Michigan in the Rose Bowl and 3-3 
overall. The Trojans have an 18-7 Rose Bowl record. . . . Schembechler has lost 
only one Rose Bowl game by more than 8 points, a 24-14 loss to UCLA in 1983.

BOWL RECORD PROVIDES INCENTIVE FOR UCLA 
</P>

<P>
Unable to beat Washington State to maintain its No. 1 ranking, or to beat USC 
to earn a trip to the Rose Bowl, UCLA can still make 1988 a noteworthy season 
by beating Arkansas today in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Outscoring the eighth-ranked Razorbacks, who were 10-0 before losing their 
regular-season finale to Miami, would give the Bruins bowl victories in seven 
consecutive seasons, a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Terry Donahue has dangled the record as incentive for his ninth-ranked 
Bruins, who were No. 1 for 2 weeks in October before staggering through the 
final month of the season, losing 2 of 4 games to finish 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
"In my eyes now, the fact that the national championship slipped away, the fact 
that we aren't the conference champion, the season is nowhere near as 
successful as I had hoped it would be, based on my expectations as they built 
throughout the season," Donahue said. "The emotions of the moment tell me that 
we've got to win this game or the season's a failure." 
</P>
<P>
And beating Arkansas, Donahue said, will not be easy, in spite of the opinions 
of the oddsmakers, who favor UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of obstacles to overcome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Donahue, the Razorbacks have several psychological advantages. 
Donahue seems to say that about every opponent, of course, but in this case he 
seems to harbor legitimate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas has worked toward this day since 1976, when it beat Georgia in its 
last Cotton Bowl appearance, whereas UCLA accepted a bid as the first team from 
the West Coast to appear in the Cotton Bowl since 1949 only as a consolation 
prize after losing a Rose Bowl showdown to USC, 31-22.

<P>
 -- Arkansas might be inspired by a natural resentment toward UCLA's 
All-American quarterback, Troy Aikman, who has received most of the attention 
from fans and the local media because the Dallas Cowboys are expected to make 
him the No. 1 pick next April in the National Football League draft. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A majority of the fans in the sold-out, 72,032-seat Cotton Bowl stadium 
will wear funny red hats shaped like hogs' heads. Whereas about 35,000 tickets 
to the game were sold in Arkansas, fewer than 3,000 were sold at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas might simply be better than advertised. The Razorbacks, some 
believe, were underrated, never rising above eighth in the national rankings. 
The Southwest Conference champions, in fact, earned more respect from their 
loss to Miami than they did from their 10 victories. And they might have beaten 
the second-ranked Hurricanes if safety Steve Atwater hadn't dropped a potential 
interception in the Arkansas end zone with fewer than 6 minutes to play. 
Miami's Carlos Huerta then kicked a 20-yard field goal with 5:38 left to give 
the Hurricanes an 18-16 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great opportunity here," Donahue said. "I think the obstacles and 
the barriers for this game are a great deal different and more challenging than 
some we've had in past (bowl) games." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, though, isn't the only one facing hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Arkansas arrived in Dallas last week, Coach Ken Hatfield had 
suspended, for unspecified reasons, All-Southwest Conference offensive guard 
Freddie Childress and defensive tackle Wayne Martin, an All-American and the 
defensive player of the year in the Southwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Neither will play today. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Razorbacks have had to deal with speculation about Hatfield, who 
reportedly is among the candidates to replace Vince Dooley at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, we'll decide about the future," said Hatfield, who has 
sidestepped all questions about his plans. 
</P>
<P>
And the Razorbacks, despite their record, were hardly a dominant team, winning 
6 games by 8 points or less, including a 21-14 victory over 0-11 Rice. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just about one step better than everybody we played and then we got to 
Miami and were about one step behind," Hatfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by quarterback Quinn Grovey, who led the Southwest Conference in 
passing efficiency but passed for only 966 yards and 4 touchdowns, the 
Razorbacks' flexbone attack ranked third in the SWC in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Razorbacks also ranked third in total defense. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, meanwhile, caught the nation's attention with its 41-28 dismantling of 
Nebraska in September, moved to No. 1 after Notre Dame knocked off Miami in 
October and rolled to a 7-0 start, its best in 22 years, before squandering a 
27-6 third-quarter lead in a 34-30 loss to Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
That was followed by less-than-impressive victories over Oregon and Stanford, 
in which Aikman endured his least productive games, and the loss to USC, in 
which Aikman was brilliant, throwing for 317 yards and 2 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hatfield said that UCLA was more balanced offensively than Miami and 
called the Bruins "as good a team as there is in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Unless they beat Arkansas, though, their season will be looked upon in some 
circles as a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can view 9-2 as an unsuccessful season, I'm not sure that I'm not as 
guilty as the next person in contributing to the madness," Donahue said. "It 
was a good year, but it just didn't meet all of our expectations." 
</P>
<P>
A victory over the Razorbacks would ease the burden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cotton Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
Of the 4 other schools that won bowl games in 6 consecutive seasons, Georgia 
Tech and Alabama had their streaks ended by Southwest Conference schools. 
Georgia Tech lost to Arkansas, 14-7, in the 1960 Gator Bowl and Alabama lost to 
Texas, 14-12, in the 1982 Cotton Bowl. USC and Nebraska also won bowl games in 
6 straight seasons. . . . In the only meeting between the schools, UCLA and 
Arkansas played to a 10-10 tie in the 1978 Fiesta Bowl. . . . UCLA is listed as 
a 5 1/2-point favorite. . . . The extended forecast called for a cloudy sky 
with temperatures in the low 50s and a 20% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is playing in a bowl game for the eighth consecutive season, the longest 
current string in the Pacific 10 Conference. Its record in bowl games is 8-7-1, 
including a 6-2-1 record under Coach Terry Donahue. . . . Arkansas is 9-12-3 in 
bowl games, including a 1-3 record under Coach Ken Hatfield and a 2-3-1 record 
in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker Eric Smith of UCLA will miss the game with knee and ankle 
injuries, Donahue said Sunday, and will be replaced in the starting lineup by 
Billy Ray. . . . UCLA also will be without inside linebacker Chance Johnson, 
who is out with a knee injury, reserve linebacker Stacy Argo and reserve 
defensive back Randy Beverly. . . . Eric Ball, who has been bothered by an 
ankle injury, will start at tailback and reserve wide receiver David Keating 
might play despite a hamstring injury, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Henry will take the place of suspended right guard Freddie Childress in 
Arkansas' starting lineup, although James Morris will move over from left guard 
to take Childress' regular place in the line. . . . Suspended defensive tackle 
Wayne Martin, who led the Razorbacks with 13 sacks, will be replaced by 
sophomore Tony Ollison. . . . James Rouse, who was Arkansas' leading rusher 
before missing the Razorbacks' last 5 games with a knee injury, is expected to 
play, but will not start.

U.S. International University will try for its second consecutive victory 
tonight, playing host to Vermont in a men's nonconference basketball game at 
7:30 in Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
USIU beat St. Francis (N.Y.), 95-77, Friday for its second victory in 3 games. 
</P>
<P>
Vermont lost, 83-76, to San Diego State Saturday. Vermont (1-5) has lost its 
last 5 games. 
</P>
<P>
Only one senior will start for either team tonight. The Gulls (5-9) have no 
senior starters, while Vermont starts two freshmen and sophomore and junior 
forwards. 
</P>
<P>
Vermont's one senior starter, 6-foot 11-inch center Joe Calavita, is averaging 
16.3 points and 9.6 rebounds and has scored in double figures in 23 consecutive 
games, including 20 Saturday against San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
USIU has started 6-11, 235-pound sophomore Mike Sterner at center. Sterner, 
however, has had his problems this season and is averaging just 4 points and 4 
rebounds. Demetrius Laffitte, a 6-5 forward, leads the team in rebounding with 
10 per game. RICK HAZLETINE

AUBURN, FLORIDA STATE HAVE CORNERS COVERED; 
</P>
<P>
IT'LL BE TIGERS' DEFENSE AGAINST SEMINOLES' OFFENSE IN TONIGHT'S SUGAR BOWL 
</P>

<P>
For Auburn's Tigers and Florida State's Seminoles, the ifs are these: 
</P>
<P>
If Notre Dame and West Virginia had been upset this season, somewhere along the 
line, and if Miami were to be upset today, Auburn and Florida State could be 
playing for No. 1 tonight in the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the way they see it, they'll be playing for No. 2, when, at the end of 
a long, 7-game day of football, the fourth-ranked Seminoles and seventh-ranked 
Tigers meet on the Superdome field at 5:30 p.m. (PST). 
</P>
<P>
By then, many sports fans will doubtless be bowled out. But others may still be 
wondering what Deion Sanders is all about. 
</P>
<P>
The pregame star of the 55th Sugar Bowl, Sanders is the fast-talking, 
fast-moving Florida State cornerback who led the nation in punt returns this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think of Florida State, you think of Deion Sanders," Auburn 
quarterback Reggie Slack said Sunday. "He's the guy who gets them their great 
field position (on punt returns). 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing (a passer) looks for is where Deion is. If I'm throwing to his 
side, I have one goal: Get the ball there quick." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders is a three-sport star who played in the New York Yankee chain last 
summer shortly after he was named the MVP of the Metro Conference track and 
field meet, where he won at 100 and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the most exciting athlete we've ever had here," Florida State Coach Bobby 
Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Seminoles under Bowden are known for offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stand a quarterback who's afraid he might throw an interception," 
Bowden said, tipping his game plan. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he also expects a big performance from running back Sammie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Dye's Auburn team, meanwhile, is known for defense. The Tigers led the 
nation this season in total defense, scoring defense and run defense. 
</P>
<P>
"You only do that if you've got quality (players) everywhere, in every 
position," said Auburn's All-American defensive tackle Tracy Rocker, the winner 
this season of both the Outland and Lombardi trophies. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State quarterback Chip Ferguson said: "People say this game is our 
offense against their defensive team. (But) I'm not so sure about that. I've 
seen our defense. It's terrific." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, working with four receivers who alternate by pairs, had a big season, 
leading the Seminoles to 10 straight victories after their stunning 31-0 defeat 
on opening day at Miami (Fla). 
</P>
<P>
Going into the Miami game, Florida State was No. 1 in the polls that Notre Dame 
leads today. What happened? 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't in the right frame of mind (for Miami)," Bowden said. "We were 
highly overconfident -- I was overconfident myself. 
</P>
<P>
"We had outplayed (Miami) the year before, and lost by 1 point. We had most of 
our team back, and they were remaking theirs. We had been practicing very well 
-- and they walloped us." 
</P>
<P>
Other Seminoles suggested that Miami may have broken Florida State's audible 
code that day. 
</P>
<P>
"They read us like a book," one Florida State coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Said a Florida State offensive tackle, Joey Ionata, "Every time we called an 
audible, (Miami) shifted right into the hole." 
</P>
<P>
But it's all over now, and, said Bowden, "The rest of the season has proved how 
good we really were then -- and are now." 
</P>
<P>
It has also proved how good Auburn is. Under Dye, whose team shared the 
Southeastern Conference title this season with LSU, the Tigers have made seven 
straight bowl trips. 
</P>
<P>
They've been one of the four biggest winners in college football the last 6 
years, winning 80% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a better defensive player than Tracy Rocker," Dye said. "And 
the rest of our defense is about as experienced as you can get. We have two or 
three great (defensive) players, and seven or eight others who are playing at 
the top of their game." 
</P>
<P>
Dye was asked what it would take today to make him identify Auburn as his 
best-ever team. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't take (more than) just a win," he said.

FORD SAYS OKLAHOMA TO PROVIDE TEST FOR CLEMSON

<P>
During the 1980s, Clemson has won 5 Atlantic Coast Conference championships and 
1 national title. During that span, Oklahoma has won 5 Big Eight championship 
and 1 national title. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are 9-2 entering today's Citrus Bowl game. Clemson is ranked 13th, 
Oklahoma 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Clemson Coach Danny Ford believes this game represents a measuring stick 
of sorts for his team. 
</P>
<P>
"We're anxious to play the University of Oklahoma because of their tradition," 
Ford said. "We want to play and see where we are. We know where Oklahoma is. 
They're there every year." 
</P>
<P>
Where Oklahoma is going is on probation. The received National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. sanctions 2 weeks ago, and this will be the Sooners last bowl 
game for at least 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer said the sanctions would have no effect on the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"That won't be an excuse," he said. "Clemson will have more to do with it than 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the week, Ford and his players have described the Sooners in glowing 
terms. Switzer, for one, doesn't believe the praise is deserved. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a good college football team, but we're not anywhere near what we have 
been before," Switzer said, alluding to the teams that went 11-1 in each of the 
past 3 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson, who lost to Florida State and North Carolina State, comes into the 
Citrus Bowl with a 4-game winning streak. The Tigers scored at least 29 points 
in each of those games. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Williams directed an I-formation offense that averaged 397 yards per 
game, the best in Ford's 10 seasons as coach. The senior quarterback, who has 
been named most valuable player in both of his bowl games, doesn't throw often 
or well, but he does win. His 31-10-2 record makes him the winningest starter 
in ACC history. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Williams doesn't throw much is tailback Terry Allen, who became the 
first Clemson sophomore to rush for more than 1,000 yards when he ran for 1,139 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson prefers to keep the ball on the ground, although Williams burned Penn 
State for 214 passing yards in a 35-10 Fiesta Bowl victory last year. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma finished fourth nationally with an average of 343 yards rushing per 
game. However, that was accomplished mostly on artificial turf and with Charles 
Thompson at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
When the Sooners take to the grass field of the Citrus Bowl, gimpy-legged 
Jamelle Holieway will be the quarterback in his final collegiate game.

TURNOVERS MIGHT PROVE COSTLY TO LSU, SYRACUSE

Coaches from Louisiana State and Syracuse, today's opponents in the Hall of 
Fame Bowl, see little difference between their teams. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have two teams as evenly matched as we are, the game is going to be 
decided by turnovers and big plays," said LSU Coach Mike Archer, whose Tigers 
will take an 8-3 record and one of the Southeastern Conference's best passing 
attacks into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is not going to be decided by whether they throw the ball well or 
not. We expect them to throw it well," said Syracuse Coach Dick MacPherson, who 
starts 5 fifth-year seniors in a secondary that hasn't given up a touchdown 
pass in 38 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the game will be decided by whoever plays the hardest, the cleanest, 
and has no turnovers, because we're both excellent football teams." 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse (9-2) is ranked 17th going into the second-ever meeting between the 
schools. LSU, a 13-10 winner over the Orangemen in the 1965 Sugar Bowl, is No. 
16 and a slight underdog despite being co-champions of the SEC in Archer's 
second season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident, we know all about the SEC, and it's a great conference," 
Syracuse quarterback Todd Philcox said. "But we played one of their teams last 
year and did pretty well. We're not in awe." 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen, 11-0 during the 1987 regular season, tied Auburn, 16-16, in last 
year's Sugar Bowl when the Tigers settled for a game-tying field goal with 1 
second left. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Orangemen won 8 of their last 9 after a 26-9 loss to Ohio 
State. The other defeat came at West Virginia, 31-9, Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
LSU also finished strongly after losing to Ohio State (36-33) and Florida 
(19-6). The Tigers began a 5-game winning streak with a 7-6 victory over Auburn 
and closed with a 30-point rout of Tulane after losing to Miami, 44-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen will play without junior running back Michael Owens, the team's 
third-leading rusher with 460 yards. MacPherson suspended him for a "repeated 
breach of team guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
All-American safety Markus Paul leads a Syracuse defense, which will try to 
stop quarterback Tommy Hodson, a 52% passer who threw for 2,074 yards and 13 
touchdowns to carry LSU after preseason knee injuries sidelined running back 
Harvey Williams and wide receiver Todd Kinchen.

Speed skater Nick Thometz, who a year ago during the U.S. Olympic trials was 
battling a blood disorder that sapped his strength, is healthy again. 
</P>
<P>
Thometz, of Minnetonka, Minn., won the U.S. International Speedskating Assn. 
sprint title Saturday by winning at 1,000 meters and taking second at 500 
meters at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
During Friday's first day of competition, he won at 500 meters and was second 
in the 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Thometz will be joined on the 4-man U.S. men's team for the World Sprint 
Championships Feb. 25-26 at Heerenveen, the Netherlands, by Olympic silver 
medalist Eric Flaim, defending world sprint champion Dan Jansen and Olympian 
David Cruikshank. 
</P>
<P>
The women's team will be headed by Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, who won 
both of her 500 meter and 1,000 meter races Friday and Saturday at the 
Wisconsin Olympic Rink. 
</P>
<P>

Lee Elder is the surprise entry in the senior division of the Tournament of 
Champions, which ushers in the professional golf season beginning Thursday at 
La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen months ago, Elder had no intention of playing in this tournament. He 
was in a hospital fighting for his life. 
</P>
<P>
Only tournament winners qualify for the opening tournament of the season. Elder 
climaxed an extraordinary comeback by winning the Gus Machado tournament in 
late November. His 6 under 65 on the last round enabled him to win by 5 shots 
with a 54-hole total of 202. He had made it back almost a year to the day after 
suffering a heart attack that threatened his life. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing ninth in the Gus Machado at Key Biscayne, Fla. Nov. 22, 1987, 
Elder became ill. He had been on a busy schedule in October and November, 
flying coast-to-coast twice and to Japan, competing in tournaments every week. 
He had complained of back and side pains during the tournament, wearing a brace 
for the last round after leading the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably was worn out, but I thought it was a back problem," Elder recalled. 
"I never thought about a heart attack. Something like that couldn't happen to 
Lee Elder. But it did. By 10 that night I was in terrible pain. I had to go to 
the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Elder was in the intensive care heart unit for 5 days and remained in the 
hospital another 9 days. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told me that only extensive tests would determine whether I would 
ever play golf again," said Elder, who arrived early in Southern California to 
practice for the tournament. "It was frightening. I was only 53 and golf was my 
life. I didn't know anything else. There was a chance I would wind up like 
Arthur Ashe, unable to compete again. 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, I was lucky. There was only a small tear in the heart. Tests 
indicated there was very little blockage of the arteries. The doctor said being 
a golfer, being outside so much and walking, probably kept me from having a 
much more severe attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten days after going to the hospital, my doctor came into the room and said, 
'I have some very good news for you. You will be able to play again. It's your 
choice. You had a stress cholesterol attack. Rest, time, no stress and 
rehabilitation are the answer. It's up to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
It meant a complete change in life style. He had to give up smoking, decrease 
his drinking, go on a low cholesterol diet and take cardiovascular treatment 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been a heart attack waiting to happen," he said. "I smoked two or three 
packs of cigarettes a day and I had been drinking heavily. I had very high 
cholesterol and wore myself out physically with all that traveling. I ate the 
worst possible foods, eggs, fatty meats and lots of it. I let myself get fat. 
In addition, I kept my anger inside of me, under control on the course. I 
wanted to keep up an image. Of course, there were times in the clubhouse when I 
blew my top. I would throw the offending club -- it's always the club's fault 
-- around the locker room after a poor round. 
</P>
<P>
"I was determined to follow orders and continue my career. Quitting smoking was 
easy. I couldn't smoke during the 14 days in the hospital. The diet and the 
drinking, except for the holidays, were not too tough, either. I'm on a 1,700 
calories per day diet and I haven't had an egg in more than a year. I go to the 
cardiovascular treatment center every day and I walk at least 2 miles." 
</P>
<P>
When the doctor told Elder he could start chipping in January, Elder said he 
wanted to play in the Senior PGA, which is played near his Palm Beach Gardens, 
Fla. home, and started Feb. 10. He was told he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"But, he told me I could start swinging a club Jan. 20," Elder said. "He told 
me it would probably hurt at first. I was to stop, take a nitroglycerin pill 
and try again. It never did hurt at all. The first few days I was afraid to 
swing hard, but when I finally did, it still didn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started hitting golf balls, it was like hitting into a three-club wind. 
I had no strength. It wasn't that difficult to adjust, especially with the 
irons. I have always been a good iron player." 
</P>
<P>
Elder, to the surprise of his doctor, played in the Senior PGA. He amazed 
everyone by shooting a 70 in the first round. Although he faded somewhat, he 
still earned $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I still had a long way to go," he said. "Probably a year. At first, I 
would play a tournament and rest one week. In warm weather I could play two in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys I used to outdrive were now hitting the ball farther than I could. I 
wanted to do some weightlifting to regain my strength, but the doctor wouldn't 
let me. However, I was allowed to use 3-pound weights when I went for my walk. 
</P>
<P>
"The change was gradual. My caddy has been with me 8 years and when I 
practiced, he would measure off the distance I hit with each club. But, I could 
tell by the way I felt that I was hitting the ball better." 
</P>
<P>
By late summer, Elder was playing regularly again and challenged in a couple of 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have felt good if I never shot better than 80," he said. "It was 
wonderful just competing again. It was a real bonus when I won the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
The victory put Elder in select company. He is one of nine pros to win $1 
million on the Regular PGA tour and also on the Senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
Elder was the first black golfer to play in the Masters. He was the first to 
make the Ryder Cup team, and the first to win a million on each tour. But he 
doesn't consider himself a pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," he said. "I had it easy. Charlie Sifford, Pete Brown and Rafe Botts. 
They took most of the knocks. They did the fighting. They were the ones not 
allowed to even dress in the clubhouse. I experienced some things, but it keeps 
getting better. I'm just trying to make it easier for those who will come along 
after me. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst experience was at the Masters in 1975. I was always on stage. 
Everybody wanted to know how it felt. And some wondered, 'Is he a gentleman?' I 
was a little bit better than the caddies. 
</P>
<P>
"In the week we (his wife Rose) were at the Masters, we had to change houses 
four times. The pressure was unfair. I couldn't think about golf. It was the 
first time I was ever happy to miss the cut. The next year Calvin Peete was 
there, too, so it was nothing." 
</P>
<P>
All the problems in a pro career that began 30 years ago don't seem too 
important since the heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lord gave me a second chance and I'm not going to get upset about 
anything," Elder said. "Maybe, I do have one little goal. I want to outdrive 
those guys again. Maybe this is the week I'll do it."

LAW OF ACADEMICS: 1ST-TERM TRUSTEE JIM ROACHE PROVES FULL OF SURPRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One Thursday last month, Jim Roache popped in unannounced at Pershing Junior 
High in San Carlos for a tour, part of his periodic efforts as a San Diego city 
school board member to get an unvarnished, grass-roots feel for trends and 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
During the school lunch break, Principal Bill Hassett took Roache, who commands 
the county sheriff's substation in Lemon Grove, to chat with three math 
teachers eating in the no-smoking lounge. Roache immediately engaged the three 
in a lively discussion about the school district's new common core curriculum, 
an idea he co-sponsored last year. The core, now being phased in, will require 
all secondary school students to take college preparatory courses in basic 
subject areas, including algebra. 
</P>
<P>
The math teachers decried the plan, saying that some students simply cannot be 
taught algebra and that to require such classes will bring only further 
frustration to teacher and student, and could result in more dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
As Roache turned to leave after 20 minutes of animated questions and answers, 
one teacher asked him what he did for a living. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in law enforcement," Roache replied, realizing the teacher had no idea he 
had been talking to a school board member. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if ever you are with school administrators, you'll find they're the ones 
cramming this thing down our throats," the teacher said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe I could plead guilty to being part of that," Roache laughed as 
he left. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact Outstrips Recognition 
</P>
<P>
The incident is illustrative of the fact that although many San Diegans -- even 
within the 11,000-employee school district -- may not recognize first-term 
board member Roache by face or name, they are keenly aware of his impact in 
changing the shape of local schools. 
</P>
<P>
Roache, finishing up only his second year as a school trustee, has surprised 
both administrators and fellow board members with his aggressive stance on 
reform issues. The many board initiatives under way have helped catapult San 
Diego into the forefront of districts nationwide that are experimenting -- at 
times with controversy -- with new ways of teaching. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Roache has belied the image he brought to the board: that of an 
inflexible right-wing ideologue. He is praised for his hard work, his 
willingness to listen and his enjoyment of debate without hidden agendas. 
Observers say he marks a substantial change in representation for his area in 
the the city's northeastern tier. Predecessor Larry Lester was an 
often-inflexible conservative member who delighted in staking out extreme 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Roache was elected the board's vice president as a prelude to 
becoming president next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jim is doing a good job, although he comes from a conservative point 
of view," said colleague Kay Davis, the board's senior member, who has had her 
share of disagreements with Roache during the past two years, in particular 
over core curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"He has very strong opinions, and sometimes he doesn't know everything about an 
issue before forming that strong opinion, and then you have to convince him to 
look at a different way or conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"But what saves him is that he really is a pragmatist who realizes this is not 
a perfect world . . . " she said. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Tom Payzant said Roache has surprised many people, including 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Game Playing 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I thought he would be more ideological and have a stereotypical 
conservative agenda, however people wanted to define that, based on the 
consensus of what people were expecting," Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I have found him very open-minded, receptive to good data and 
well-reasoned argument, and his candor and ability to go to the heart of issues 
are very refreshing. Plus he has a good sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"He has no hidden agendas and does no game playing, and that is commendable in 
public policy-making," Payzant said. "We do disagree at times, but he also has 
also taken risks and told his community things that they don't necessarily want 
to hear. That makes him very effective over the long haul in understanding the 
conflict at times between representing the people of his district and the best 
interests of students in all of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Smith, who retired last month after eight years on the board 
representing heavily minority areas, said Roache has the potential to be the 
group's most influential member. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1987, Smith and Roache formed an alliance, considered unusual by some 
at the time, to push the core curriculum with colleagues and top administrators 
who were initially less than enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite my own misgivings at first -- I thought he was a little naive -- I 
soon found he really cared for kids," Smith said, citing a talk Roache gave at 
the dedication of DePortola Middle School in early 1987. "I didn't know what 
deep feelings he had for education until I heard him speak that day about 
patriotism, about high standards for all children (a longtime priority for 
Smith) and how education will affect America's future. 
</P>
<P>
"He opened his heart that day, and I was in tears at the end." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew He'd Be Stereotyped 
</P>
<P>
The lean, intense sheriff's captain said he knew he would be stereotyped when 
he joined the board. After all, his 1986 election opponent, Sue Braun, had 
labled Roache's background as simply "jails, jails, jails" in mocking his 
campaign for an education office. Roache won the final vote by a scant 903 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"People said, 'He's a cop, he's a non-educator, he's a white male, and he comes 
from a predominantly Caucasian district.' And in their minds, that added up to 
a right-wing, red-necked, kick-ass, take-names conservative," Roache said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I am a conservative, but to me, that means a value system that at its 
base says that education is important to society, and that means my objective 
is to have all kids receive the best possible education no matter what color 
they are or where they come from." 
</P>
<P>
Both his own uneven educational background and his 18 years in law enforcement, 
often dealing with school-related problems, have helped bring forth not a 
cynical view of society, as many administrators assumed, but rather a sense 
that all things are possible. 
</P>
<P>
Roache acknowledges that he stayed in high school -- he graduated from 
Twentynine Palms High north of Palm Springs -- only because of athletics, and 
he dropped out of Grossmont College before joining the Air Force in the 
mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Only after several years of supporting a wife and child on an enlisted man's 
sparse salary did Roache realize he needed further education to make more of 
his life. He returned to community college and eventually graduated from San 
Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Is Building Blocks 
</P>
<P>
"That is why the common core concept has been so important to me," Roache said. 
"A lot of kids are like I was, who don't know where they are going, who have no 
immediate goals. But at some point in the future, they will develop a plan, and 
the key is to give them the fundamental academic building blocks so that they 
won't be encumbered by poor basic educational preparation like I was when I 
matured. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll still have to work hard, but at least they will stand a chance of 
making it more quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roache also links the core concept to his years in dealing with juveniles in 
trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I'm a blue-collar type of guy, and I make no pretense to be an 
intellectual," Roache said. "But when I see a kid picked up for burglary or 
whatever, I sometimes talk with them and I see a chance is still there, that 
almost no one is beyond salvation and that there is always the chance that 
somebody will connect with them to turn them around." 
</P>
<P>
In his position as station commander, Roache oversees all contacts between his 
officers and public schools in the Grossmont and Lemon Grove school districts, 
giving him an additional perspective on school-related issues. Grossmont Union 
High School District Supt. Robert Pyle consults periodically with Roache on 
issues from violence to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Roache concedes that other San Diego board members, such as Kay Davis, have 
questioned his commitment to programs for children identified as gifted or for 
advanced placement testing for students ticketed for blue-chip universities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Them to Have the Option 
</P>
<P>
"I do care about those programs because those children are going to be our 
future doctors and physicists," Roache said. "But I am firmly convinced that 
the great portion of our future leaders, from clergy to politicians, are going 
to be from the vast, amorphous group of regular education kids, and they are 
going to end up driving our culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the common core so that more of these kids will have the options of 
being among our future leaders." 
</P>
<P>
The hard-charging style with which Roache has approached life admittedly has 
clashed with the nature of school board decision making. 
</P>
<P>
"I am impatient, I want to see quick results, but I know that on a lot of 
issues, the quick fix won't work and that it takes time on long-range, complex 
things such as the core," Roache said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, I would have liked to have had the core curriculum implemented 
everywhere at once. But my philosophy is also to be pragmatic, to take a little 
at a time if you can't persuade everyone of the validity of the entire program. 
The reality of implementation involves budgets and teachers and administrators, 
and I know from my own experience (he oversees 40 people with an annual budget 
of $1.5 million) that it must be a group effort. . . . I need to give others 
more time to work through things." 
</P>
<P>
Roache has staked out clear positions on two major issues expected to come 
before the board in 1989: a possible change to district-only elections and the 
idea of health clinics at schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relishes the Debate 
</P>
<P>
On both, he appears opposed to positions of the two new board members, Ann 
Armstrong and Shirley Weber, but Roache said he looks forward to honest debate 
and, where possible, compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Roache arranged for the board to meet in an informal workshop last 
month where members could learn about their colleagues' philosophies candidly 
and firsthand, rather than relying on media reports as the previous board did 
in forming its first impressions of Roache. 
</P>
<P>
He cites his own votes on year-round schools as a reason for keeping the 
present system of electing school board members, rather than opting for 
elections by geographic district only. (Currently, two finalists are nominated 
in a primary by voters in their geographic district, but compete in the entire 
school district in the final election.) Roache went against the wishes of many 
in the upscale, influential Scripps Ranch area in 1987 by supporting Payzant's 
recommendation to have the area's elementary school, Jerabek, go year-round on 
a four-track schedule to relieve overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that some constituents still feel I sold them down the river," 
Roache said. After more than a year of implementation, the year-round schedule 
is said to be going smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I voted in opposition, how in good conscience could I tell some other 
school or some other community in San Diego to go multi-track year-round? Yet 
if we had district-only elections, I don't know how I could risk making such a 
vote and not become the target of organized special interests and community 
activists, who have great power within districts, at the next election." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversy Could Erupt 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of health clinics, Roache was told last month by Hassett, the 
principal at Pershing, that clinics are needed because too many children do not 
have regular medical care until their illnesses become crises. 
</P>
<P>
"How you do it given the controversy that could erupt, I don't know," Hassett 
said, referring to a wrenching board debate that occurred three years ago over 
the issue of providing birth control and abortion information. The board voted 
3 to 2 against a Payzant plan for the clinics. Roache's predecessor, Lester, 
led the battle against them. 
</P>
<P>
However, both new members, Weber and Armstrong, favor clinics and, together 
with board President Susan Davis, could provide the majority needed to 
establish them. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree that there is a legitimate need for health care services for 
adolescents and youth and it is not being met now," Roache said. "I have 
political reservations about whether that is proper for schools, but the 
practical side of me says that society is paying a tremendous cost because it 
isn't being done elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"If some program can be designed for those services, I would favor it. But if 
you add birth control and abortion aspects, that offends me. I want some 
parental contact included when you do that, even though I know a lot of parents 
don't talk to their children about (sex-related) matters and that some kids 
don't have parents to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
"But it just offends me if we don't bring the parent or guardian into the 
process on the campus. . . . By not doing so, we are saying we know what is 
best for their kid despite any moral or religious values of the family, or that 
parents aren't thinking right on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, we are arguing in all our reform efforts that parent support 
is vital for the success of school, but we don't want them there when it comes 
to pregnancy or sex." 
</P>
<P>
Roache said he will work for compromise if both sides are amenable. Despite his 
feelings on family planning, he supports programs at several high schools that 
allow teen-age mothers to continue their schooling while receiving child care 
and birth control information. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just throw the kids out of school," Roache said. "This is a real, 
real difficult issue, and we have to avoid the extremism of both sides."

MOTORCYCLE THEFT SUSPECT WOUNDED BY LA MESA POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A La Mesa police officer shot a man in the chest Friday night while police were 
attempting to arrest him in Lemon Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified as James L. Warnicke, 22, of Lemon Grove was listed in 
serious condition Sunday at UC San Diego Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
La Mesa police spokeswoman Allison Moore said Officer Jeff Allen followed two 
motorcyclists to a Lemon Grove liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting outside, Allen was advised by his radio dispatcher that one of the 
motorcycles had been reported stolen. The officer asked for backup assistance 
and when other officers arrived, they confronted the two men. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that the officers asked both men to raise their hands, but that 
Warnicke "suddenly moved his hands to an object in his waistband." She said the 
officers again ordered him to stop, but that Warnicke repeated the movement and 
that Allen then fired one shot, hitting Warnicke in the right side of the 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
Warnicke was taken by Life-flight to the medical center, where he was held on 
suspicion of motorcycle theft. 
</P>
<P>
His companion, Andre Perez, 26, of La Mesa, was held in the downtown county 
jail on suspicion of possessing a dangerous weapon and on several outstanding 
warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said detectives found a knife at the scene, but she said it was unclear 
what, if anything, Warnicke may have had inside his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a 3-year police veteran, was placed on administrative leave while the 
investigation is continuing.

SMOKE FROM RUBBISH FIRE FILLS JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burning rubbish and debris was placed inside a ventilation system duct at the 
federal Metropolitan Correctional Center Sunday afternoon, sending a large 
amount of smoke wafting through several levels of the high-rise jail building 
downtown, San Diego fire officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Capt. William Middleton said there were no injuries to inmates but the 
incident presented some problems for jail officials because smoke was blown 
through several stories of the complex. He said the burning material had been 
placed inside a duct on the 8th floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than that, it was a relatively small fire and easy to contain," 
Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported about 2:30 p.m., he said. Because the location was a 
high-rise, 24-story structure, the Fire Department sent a large number of units 
to the scene, including eight engine companies, four truck companies, a rescue 
rig, three battalion chiefs and one division chief. 
</P>
<P>
Jail officials declined to comment on the incident.

A TOPANGA-BASED GROUP IS OPPOSING U.S. POLICY BY HELPING NICARAGUANS WITH

Ted Heselton is, in effect, a contra Contra. The 40-year-old West 
Kennebunkport, Me., carpenter and Vietnam veteran spent 6 weeks in war-torn 
Nicaragua in 1987 helping build houses, a school and a water system in a poor 
rural cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
"I was frustrated with demonstrations and wanted to do something more personal 
and practical," said Heselton, a staunch opponent of U.S. support for the 
anti-Sandinista rebels. "The point is to somehow help the situation rather than 
having those policies done in my name as a U.S. taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
Heselton is one of 350 volunteers from across the nation who have been 
recruited and dispatched to Nicaragua's battle-scarred highlands since 1984 by 
a Topanga-based organization, Architects and Planners in Support of Nicaragua. 
These short-term brigadistas have built 85 homes, four schools and four water 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Providing Equipment 
</P>
<P>
APSNICA, as it is known, has also shipped $170,000 in trucks, generators, 
chain-saw mills and other equipment to Nicaragua and taught campesinos to use 
them. It has sent teachers, biochemists and transportation planners to the 
Central American country for several months each to assist the government. It 
has arranged trips for Americans to see the revolution firsthand. And, most 
recently, it is helping rebuild a hurricane-ravaged village. 
</P>
<P>
Its slogan defines its mission: "Help Build Not Destroy in Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
The grass-roots, nonprofit project is run out of an architectural firm, set 
deep within wooded Topanga Canyon, that specializes in helping the poor and 
handicapped. APSNICA is one of a handful of groups nationwide -- and the 
largest in Southern California -- that recruits Americans to support a 
Sandinista revolution that the Reagan Administration has actively opposed for 
the past 8 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenging Policy 
</P>
<P>
"Our idea always was that we should bring people down in different capacities 
so that they can see what was happening there, work with the Nicaraguans, help 
them, but also come back here and tell others what they've seen so we can 
change the policy of the Administration," said Stephen Kerpen, 52, the Topanga 
architect who founded and directs APSNICA. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a policy, sad to say, that doesn't respect the sovereignty of Nicaragua, 
that's contemptuous of Third World people. And it's a policy that kills men, 
women and children." 
</P>
<P>
APSNICA's educational program -- which includes individual slide shows, house 
parties and a quarterly newsletter -- has reached more than 15,000 individuals 
in the United States, Kerpen said. Volunteers have also made presentations to 
civic groups, including several local Rotary clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, groups such as the Quixote Center in Mount Rainier, Md.; Witness 
for Peace in Washington, and TecNica in Berkeley have raised $202 million in 
labor and supplies for Nicaragua since June, 1985, according to Sister Maureen 
Fiedler, co-director of the Quixote Center. In addition, she said 1,500 
Americans are working in Nicaragua at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
These efforts seek to counteract U.S. military and humanitarian support for the 
Contras. In fact, Fiedler said, annual fund-raising goals have been based on 
the amount of U.S. Contra aid. 
</P>
<P>
APSNICA's recruits represent a cross-section of men and women from 15 states. 
Their ranks have included a cabinetmaker, computer programmer, factory worker, 
lawyer, park ranger, electrician, waitress, mechanical engineer, university 
lecturer and music teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Some enlist because they want to see firsthand what's happening in Nicaragua, 
Kerpen said. Others are drawn to a revolution that they say epitomizes a sense 
of community and idealism that is missing in the United States. Many are driven 
by opposition to the Administration's Central American policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selective Service Age 
</P>
<P>
Heselton, who lives 12 miles from President-elect George Bush's family estate, 
has another, more personal, incentive to see the Central American hostilities 
end: His 19-year-old son recently registered with the Selective Service. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see him killing Nicaraguans, and I don't want to see him in a 
war down there," he said. "I don't see anything going on in Central America 
that's worth Americans dying for." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone pays his or her way down, room and board, a $300 administrative fee 
and insurance costs as well as foregoing potential earnings at home. APSNICA 
bluntly advises prospective recruits that they are putting themselves "in an 
inherently risky situation." 
</P>
<P>
Participants find various ways to take the time off. Some are self-employed. 
Those who work in construction may go during the winter lull. Some teachers use 
their summer vacations. Others take a leave of absence or go between jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department does not have an official policy opposing such groups 
as APSNICA as long as they comply with U.S. law, said press officer Anita 
Stockman. Kerpen, however, maintains that APSNICA has been harassed by the 
government while shipping supplies. And some U.S. elected officials are 
critical of those who seek to bolster the Managua government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sandinistas Criticized 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to object to people building shelter for the citizens of Nicaragua, 
who are certainly among the oppressed of the earth," said Rep. Henry Hyde 
(R-Ill.), a high-profile Contra supporter. "I do object to strengthening the 
Sandinista government because I think it's a tyranny." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sandinistas -- who work closely with APSNICA -- welcome the 
volunteers with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been doing a wonderful job there," said Rita Clark, who is assistant 
to Nicaragua's charge d'affaires in Washington and has visited APSNICA 
projects. "These are people who saw a need and they started helping. The more 
they do, the more they want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Weiss, 41, a Minneapolis carpenter and self-described anti-imperialist, 
first went to Nicaragua with APSNICA in early 1987. He returned for almost 8 
months later in the year as a project coordinator with his wife and two 
daughters. He's going back for 6 weeks in March. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Won't Give Up' 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said he was most impressed by the pride and determination of the 
Nicaraguan peasants. For example, he recalled sitting around a campfire one 
evening when two older couples discussed the hardships they endured under Gen. 
Anastasio Somoza, the former U.S.-backed Nicaraguan president who was ousted by 
the revolution in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy said, 'We'll die before we'll go back to that. We're campesinos. We 
know hunger. We can do that again. But we won't give up what we have for 
anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two events in the past 2 years have spurred APSNICA to expand its activities. 
The most recent was Hurricane Joan, which killed more than 116 Nicaraguans in 
October and further wracked an economy already crippled by war. 
</P>
<P>
In response, APSNICA established a wood-milling operation in Pearl Lagoon on 
the Caribbean coast 25 miles north of Bluefields, a town of 42,000 that was 
largely destroyed. Volunteers are harvesting hurricane-felled trees on the 
river bank and floating them downriver to the mill, where they will be used to 
rebuild homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Activist's Death 
</P>
<P>
The other occurrence was the death of Benjamin E. Linder, 27, a mechanical 
engineer from Portland, Ore., who suffered a fatal head wound in 1987 when his 
armed work crew was ambushed by rebels in the northern Nicaragua war zone. 
Linder was working on a hydroelectric project under the auspices of the 
Nicaragua Appropriate Technology Project, which he had helped found. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt strongly that he was targeted because he was a real figure down 
there," Kerpen said as he sat at his desk beneath a poster of Nicaraguan 
President Daniel Ortega. "And we felt it was a means for this Administration to 
stop other Americans from building in Nicaragua. So instead of stopping us, we 
made plans to build twice as much." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Linder, who was reportedly carrying a Kalashnikov assault rifle for 
protection, APSNICA volunteers do not bear arms. Instead, they put themselves 
in the hands of the cooperative defense committees. There have been no APSNICA 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The construction efforts are around the town of Mantiguas in the Matagalpa 
region of north-central Nicaragua, which Kerpen describes as "a war zone but 
not what you might call a combat zone." Volunteers have heard mortar fire but 
never been in imminent danger, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grieving Mother 
</P>
<P>
They have encountered grieving Nicaraguans, however. When an APSNICA-sponsored 
delegation visited a cooperative that had been attacked by Contras, a woman 
took the group to the grave site of her 16-year-old son who had been killed 5 
days earlier, Kerpen recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'If any of you have cameras, take pictures of all the kids because I 
don't even have a photograph of my son.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, the volunteers face many hardships. Health problems are endemic. APSNICA 
warns participants prior to departure that typhoid fever is "not uncommon"; 
hepatitis is "very common"; malaria is "quite common"; worms, amoebas and other 
diarrhea-causing parasites are "almost inevitable," and "many Nicaraguan dogs 
have rabies." 
</P>
<P>
Living conditions are primitive. The weather is hot and humid. Food is simple. 
The workweek entails 45 hours of hard physical labor. Volunteers wash their 
clothes by hand in the river. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Self-Sufficient 
</P>
<P>
"I realized how simple the life is there, how people have learned to live on 
the basis of their ability to devise tools and hard work," said Lisa Aarli, 29, 
a Chicago tenant organizer who spent 2 months in Nicaragua in early 1988. "It 
was one of the most intensive experiences of my life." 
</P>
<P>
The experience of working in Nicaragua generally reinforces pre-existing 
support for the revolution or creates new-found sympathy, Kerpen said. 
Volunteers Heselton, Weiss and Aarli said this was the case for them. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Aarli said: "We were very isolated. We were staying on this cooperative. 
We didn't get out to see other things. In some ways, I didn't see much in a 
bigger, broader sense." 
</P>
<P>
It was the bigger geopolitical picture that Kerpen says drew him to Nicaragua 
as a cause. A native New Yorker, he began his architectural activism nearly 25 
years ago with urban renewal efforts in Harlem and continued them when he moved 
to California in the late '60s and directed the Rural Development Corp., which 
built federally subsidized housing in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unpaid Post 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, he established a private architectural firm specializing in low-income 
housing and barrier-free designs for the disabled with his partner, David 
Marshall. Peoples Center for Housing Change now provides the headquarters and 
corporate umbrella for APSNICA; Kerpen is the unsalaried, full-time director, 
while Marshall handles Peoples Center's paying clients. 
</P>
<P>
Kerpen and two others founded APSNICA after a trip to Nicaragua in 1984. The 
idea arose when a Sandinista official asked them to raise money in the United 
States for housing in Nicaragua. The first brigade was dispatched in December, 
1985, to build 25 simple 3-room, brick-and-stone houses, a 1,200-square-foot 
school and a water system. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people will ask us, 'Well, aren't there communists down there?' " Kerpen 
said. "The fact is that every country has a right to decide what kind of a 
government they have. . . . Of course, if anything, it's a nationalist 
government down there and nothing else. But the question itself is 
impertinent."

ECONOMISTS SPLIT ON WHERE U.S. IS HEADED; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL AGREES DEFICIT IS KEY ISSUE BUT DIVIDES ON CHANCE OF RECESSION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times' panel of distinguished economists reached a standoff 
this year, equally divided over whether 1989 will be the year that a recession 
finally halts America's longest postwar boom. 
</P>
<P>
But the six members of The Times' Board of Economists who participated in the 
year-end survey more or less agreed that three key issues will determine 1989's 
economic fate. These are whether the Bush Administration and Congress will 
agree on meaningful steps to lower the budget deficit; the reactions of foreign 
investors, especially the Japanese, to economic developments here, and whether 
American consumers, loaded down with record levels of debt, will nevertheless 
continue to spend beyond their means. 
</P>
<P>
As always, the Federal Reserve Board's role in setting interest rates, largely 
in response to these issues, also is considered crucial. 
</P>
<P>
The economists' forecasts differ so widely mainly because they hinge on 
predictions of human behavior and the outcome of political maneuvering in 
Washington, rather than simple number-crunching. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six Participants 
</P>
<P>
The bright note this year is that the board of economists as a group is 
somewhat less pessimistic now than a year ago. Jarred by the October, 1987, 
stock market crash, five out of eight board members last year predicted 
recession in 1988. But the American economy romped right past the crash, 
growing by at least 2.6% last year. 
</P>
<P>
Only six economists participated this year because two have been enlisted in 
the service of the Bush Administration. Michael A. Boskin resigned from the 
board because he was named chairman of the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers. Board member Allan H. Meltzer, a professor of political economy and 
public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, declined to participate because he 
is now serving as an adviser to the President's council. 
</P>
<P>
The three who predict no recession in 1989 are George L. Perry, a senior fellow 
at the Brookings Institution in Washington; Paul R. Krugman, a professor of 
economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Irwin L. Kellner, 
chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But those who predict that the expansion will come to an end in what is now its 
seventh year are Robert Lekachman, professor of economics at Lehman College of 
the City University of New York and author of "Visions and Nightmares: America 
After Reagan"; David M. Gordon, economics professor at the New School for 
Social Research in New York, and A. Gary Shilling, a New York-based economic 
consultant and author of "The World Has Definitely Changed." 
</P>
<P>
While the budget deficit has been a big concern in past years, this year the 
economists agree that it is a pivotal question for the U.S. economy in 1989. 
One reason is that the budget deficit, and the related U.S. trade deficit, have 
become key determinants for how foreign investors and foreign central bankers 
react, driving the dollar down or up, and making foreign capital for investment 
here plentiful or scarce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recession Scenario 
</P>
<P>
The two economists who believe that Congress and the new President will be able 
to agree promptly on budgetary steps serious enough to impress the jittery 
world markets predicted that the economic expansion will continue at least one 
more year, although the economy will probably grow at a slower rate. One, 
Krugman, predicted no recession even though he doubts that there will be much 
progress on the deficit this year. 
</P>
<P>
But the rest, who don't expect agreement this year on spending cuts or a 
combination of spending cuts and tax increases predicted a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The recession scenario generally goes like this: A marked failure to do 
something about the deficit could cause the dollar to drop dramatically against 
major foreign currencies such as the yen and the West German mark as foreign 
investors conclude that the U.S. economy isn't such a good investment and 
foreign central bankers decide that there is no longer any point to propping up 
the dollar. The Fed responds by sharply raising interest rates to attract back 
foreign investors (higher interest rates on investments help compensate 
investors for a depreciating dollar) and to choke off inflation that may be 
caused by more expensive imports. 
</P>
<P>
But a big hike in interest rates could easily end the expansion and would be 
particularly dangerous at a time when both individuals and companies are loaded 
up with record levels of debt. 
</P>
<P>
Making the situation even more fragile, says Shilling, is that record amounts 
of both personal and company debt are now subject to fluctuating, variable-rate 
interest payments. This includes variable-rate mortgages, home equity loans and 
credit card accounts for individuals, as well as variable-rate borrowing by 
companies. As a result, Shilling says, any big hike in interest rates would be 
felt almost immediately throughout the economy, triggering bankruptcies and an 
abrupt drop-off of consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
Shilling foresees a recession starting in the first half of 1989, setoff in 
part by the Fed raising interest rates to choke off a perceived threat of 
renewed inflation and to make up for an expected loss of confidence in the 
American economy by foreign investors. "It will be a classic case of the Fed 
being forced to raise short-term interest rates to recession-precipitating 
levels," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Shilling also sees the first strong signs in some time of fear by industry that 
inflation, currently at a relatively low rate of 4.5% annually as measured by 
the consumer price index, is about to take off. Companies, he says, are doing 
the first hedge-buying of inventory -- stocking up on supplies in expectation 
that prices are about to go up -- since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Lekachman, another predictor of recession, owns up to having forecast a 
downturn every year for the past four years. But he maintains that "the chances 
are about 2 to 1 that by the fourth quarter of 1989, we'll see the recession." 
He predicts that the main cause will be Japanese investors and Japan's central 
bank, responding to what they view as a weak U.S. President and a political 
"mess" in Washington's approach to the deficit. Lekachman notes that the United 
States depends on a massive influx of foreign capital and says he detects signs 
that the Japanese are increasingly willing to throw their weight around on the 
global economic scene. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reprieve Predicted 
</P>
<P>
If the Japanese lose confidence in Bush's ability to reduce the deficit, they 
may well reduce their buying at U.S. Treasury auctions, which in turn could 
sharply push up U.S. interest rates. "This will be the classic trigger for a 
recession," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon foresees a particularly deep recession. "It's going to be pretty nasty 
because of the mountainous levels of personal and corporate debt," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But Kellner, a member of The Times' board who last year predicted a recession, 
this year thinks the economy will squeak by with another reprieve. Kellner 
thinks that despite the political problems, the Bush Administration will win an 
agreement this year with legislators on a plan to eliminate the deficit over 
four years. This, he maintains, would be enough to satisfy foreign investors 
and Japanese and European governments and allow the Fed to ease up on its 
current tight-money policy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kellner predicts a slackening of consumer spending sufficient to 
keep inflation in check but not severe enough to induce a recession. Of the six 
economists, Kellner alone expects consumer spending to slow significantly 
without a sharp jolt of higher interest rates first. 
</P>
<P>
Economic forecasters consider consumer spending extremely important to their 
calculations since it makes up about two-thirds of the nation's economic 
activity. (Slightly under half of this goes for items bought in stores, the 
rest goes for rent, health care, transportation and other services.) 
</P>
<P>
Kellner believes that consumers are getting exhausted from years of increased 
spending and are about to cut back. With employment high, he says, "There is no 
pent-up demand for big ticket items people delayed buying because they were out 
of work." 
</P>
<P>
He also notes that prices of expensive consumer items have risen faster than 
most peoples' incomes. "Given that the cost of big-ticket items has gone up 
faster than incomes, people have bought about all they're going to buy," he 
asserts. As evidence, he cites the fact that consumer spending, adjusted for 
inflation, was lower this fall than it was two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of The Times panel, however, doubts that consumers are likely to begin 
acting so rationally. Some say that during the past eight years, encouraged by 
the economic boom and the Republican Administration's supply side economics, 
the habit of spending much and saving little has become ingrained. "Ronald 
Reagan . . . really has gone a long distance to reinforce the American attitude 
of spend today, pay tomorrow," says Lekachman. 
</P>
<P>
Shilling, too, sees no signs of consumer spending slowing down. He notes that 
the stock market crash didn't shock consumers into spending less. "The consumer 
just isn't giving up," he said. "People are way overextended. They're borrowing 
to pay their bills. People don't want to give up on the American dream of 
ever-increasing purchasing power." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Economy Pretty Healthy' 
</P>
<P>
Early indications that 1988 Christmas buying was relatively strong seem to give 
credit to those who see no falloff of consumer spending. One fear is that 
continued strong consumer demand will add to inflationary pressures, forcing 
the Fed to continue raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
But Perry, although he foresees little change in consumer spending levels this 
year, says he isn't particularly worried. "I think the economy is pretty 
healthy," he states, adding that he thinks a recession in 1989 is unlikely. 
"People have predicted it every year, and every year they've been wrong," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that the economy is slowing a bit and that the gross national 
product -- a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy -- will 
continue to grow at an acceptably low rate of about 3% in 1989. Perry doubts 
that foreigners will become so concerned about the U.S. economic situation that 
they will begin dumping dollars. And he said that any substantial improvement 
in the budget deficit would be met by a decline in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
He gives the Fed credit for keeping growth rates and inflation in check. "The 
Fed is doing what it traditionally has done, to lean against the wind," Perry 
says. "It sees an expansion that is still pretty vigorous, and it's letting 
interest rates rise to take a little steam out." 
</P>
<P>
Krugman, while not completely ruling out the possibility of recession in 1989, 
sees a greater risk of an overheating economy. "The fundamentals are that we 
still have very strong domestic demand and a weak dollar," he says. He believes 
that the Fed will continue to nudge up interest rates, even enough to send some 
highly leveraged companies into bankruptcy. But because demand is so strong, he 
doesn't predict a full-fledged recession. Because with the wave of corporate 
takeovers and leveraged buyouts companies are heavily indebted, "what we have 
is a strange economy -- you could have a lot of bankrupt companies working at 
(full) capacity."

BUSINESS GROUPS CALL DEFICIT REDUCTION MOST CRITICAL TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For organizations representing business in Washington, the transition from 
President Reagan to President Bush is a change from very good to even better. 
</P>
<P>
Business almost always found itself on Reagan's side. His campaigns to cut tax 
rates and reduce burdensome federal regulations could have been written in 
corporate board rooms. 
</P>
<P>
But Reagan's Administration was a tumultuous one. He vetoed 78 pieces of 
legislation in his eight years, and Congress managed to override him nine 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Now representatives of business organizations are looking forward with pleasure 
to a kinder, gentler era. George Bush, while no less business oriented than 
Reagan, is a two-term veteran of the House of Representatives; of the 13 
Cabinet members he has selected so far, two are former senators and three are 
former House members. 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders predict that Bush will try to establish a more cooperative 
relationship with the Democratic-controlled House and Senate. And that, they 
hope, will prove more productive -- especially on the all-important issue of 
reducing the federal deficit -- than Reagan's more confrontational style. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush is a consummate Washington insider," said Joseph P. O'Neil, president of 
the American Retail Federation. "He's more inclined to seek accommodations than 
President Reagan was. On that score, a lot of issues left on the table are 
likely to get settled." 
</P>
<P>
For example, several business lobbyists suggested, Bush might propose a 
compromise minimum wage increase, lower than the $4.55 an hour unsuccessfully 
sought by the Democrats. That way, Bush could get credit for helping the 
working poor without offending business groups. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Bush proposals on parental leave and child care would force Congress 
to address those issues on his terms and impose less of a burden on business 
than Democratic alternatives that were talked to death in the Senate last fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prefer Spending Cuts 
</P>
<P>
Business has no particular legislative wish list of its own. At one time it 
might have hoped that Bush would follow through on a campaign promise and 
propose a tax break for capital gains. But now it understands that Bush does 
not dare propose tinkering with the tax code for fear that Congress would take 
the opportunity to legislate tax increases as well as reductions.

"Business agenda?" asked Stacy Mobley, vice president for federal relations of 
Du Pont Co. "We're always reacting. This coming year, like all other years, 
we're going to be reacting." Business' fondest hope is that Bush and Congress 
will join forces to reduce the federal deficit. Business organizations regard 
spending cuts as the best approach, although some of them would even tolerate a 
tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Ross, assistant vice president for communications of the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers, said NAM hoped that Bush would follow the lead of the National 
Economic Commission, a congressionally mandated blue-ribbon panel that is to 
recommend budget-cutting measures next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We favor spending cuts," Ross said, "and then a consumption tax increase as a 
last resort." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil, of the American Retail Federation, agreed that the budget was the most 
critical issue facing the nation and said a lot of Washington insiders expected 
a tax increase next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Retailers are against consumption taxes," he said, "but a lot of business 
firms would support a gasoline tax increase as a way to cut the deficit if the 
money is earmarked for that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Mobley also rated deficit reduction as Bush's leading problem. "Everything 
hinges on that," Mobley said. "At least a combination of spending cuts and new 
revenues are needed. Bush is going to have to play an active role. I don't 
foresee any stalemate or legislative gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Veto Less Likely 
</P>
<P>
As for a gasoline tax increase, he added: "We're not pushing it, but if you had 
to look at additional revenues, it's broad-based, doesn't adversely affect 
energy-intensive industries and is probably the lesser of all the evils." 
</P>
<P>
But most business representatives take a hard line against any kind of tax 
increase. "If Bush agrees to a tax increase as the Democrats want him to do, 
he's a one-term President," said John J. Motley, legislative director for the 
National Federation of Independent Business, which represents small retail and 
service firms with an average of eight employees and $500,000 in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
And Stephen Moore, a budget analyst for the business-backed Heritage 
Foundation, said Bush should be willing to accept the automatic, indiscriminate 
spending cuts of the Gramm-Rudman law rather than raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
On overall relations with Congress, there was a consensus that Bush would be 
far less likely to resort to the veto and more likely to make deals with the 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush is a product of Washington," Du Pont's Mobley said. "He didn't run 
against Washington. My feeling is that he will be able to work with Congress 
better than Reagan or Jimmy Carter. I think he will seek accommodation." 
</P>
<P>
Al Bourland, a veteran of 20 years of lobbying for the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Bush) is going to put out the olive branch more than Reagan did," Bourland 
said. "I think you'll have less of a philosophical approach -- he's more 
inclined to a political, pragmatic solution." 
</P>
<P>
But Bourland added that the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate could 
challenge Bush on the theory that he is less popular than Reagan and thus less 
likely to be able to appeal to the public over the heads of the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he said, business groups could rely on a Reagan veto or the threat 
of a Reagan veto to influence major legislation as it went through the House 
and Senate. "It was one of the biggest arrows in our quiver," Bourland 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, think that Bush could undercut his -- and business's -- 
political opponents by going on the offensive on such controversial issues as 
raising the federal minimum wage, unchanged since 1981 at $3.35 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats brought up a bill this year to raise that figure to $4.55 an 
hour, but Republicans filibustered it to death -- even though Bush said in a 
campaign statement that he favored some unspecified increase. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyist Motley said Bush could propose a $4.25 hourly rate, together with a 
lower figure for young people, and probably get near-unanimous Republican 
support and enough Democrats to assure the bill's enactment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you may see this Administration go on the offensive with initiatives 
of their own in two or three areas," Motley said. 
</P>
<P>
The same technique, business lobbyists agreed, could be employed on other 
social legislation to get bipartisan backing for Bush initiatives on child 
care, unpaid leave for new parents and health insurance for workers not covered 
by company plans. 
</P>
<P>
And on environmental issues, business expects renewed action now that Senate 
Democrats have selected George J. Mitchell of Maine as their new leader and 
Bush has named William K. Reilly, president of the World Wildlife Fund, as head 
of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Congress is likely to try to amend the Clean Air Act, a pet 
issue of Mitchell's. But business groups are confident that Mitchell will have 
to make concessions to their concerns over additional costs if he wants to get 
the legislation through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
On their major stand against new federal benefits, the business groups expect 
Bush to be on their side, with his veto pen ready if necessary. But there is a 
yearning for a more ecumenical style. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush is a very pro-business President, and we're grateful for that," said the 
NAM's Ross. "But problems are coming to a head, with a lot of unfinished 
business. We need a consensus approach."

INVESTING IN 1989;

<P>
PLAYING IT SAFE COULD BE WRONG STRATEGY;

REAL ESTATE, SHORT-TERM BONDS LOOK GOOD BUT ART MARKET MAY COOL

<P>
Investors played it safe in 1988. But they would have been better off had they 
not. And being overly cautious this year also could be a mistake, many 
investment advisers say. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by takeovers, strong corporate earnings and other factors, stocks defied 
a mass exodus by individual investors to post double-digit gains last year. As 
the table accompanying this story shows, equities and equity mutual funds 
easily beat bonds, savings and most other conservative investments that small 
investors generally preferred amid lingering memories of the October, 1987, 
stock crash. 
</P>
<P>
But bonds -- led by the high-yield "junk" sector -- did well during the year, 
despite rising interest rates toward year-end that pushed prices down and 
partially offset gains in yields. 
</P>
<P>
Collectibles posted a mixed year, with art topping all major investments in 
1988 with a whopping 41.99% gain through November, and rare investment-grade 
coins finishing second. But stamp prices took a licking, rising just barely. 
The biggest losers: gold and silver, hit by abundant supplies and subdued fears 
of higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Will these trends continue in 1989? Not surprisingly, experts can't agree on 
the overall direction for stocks and bonds. But on some things there is general 
agreement: 
</P>
<P>
* Buyers of short-term bonds and money market funds will continue to enjoy 
among the best yields in years, at least into the early part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
* Although the Dow Jones industrial index closed 1988 near a post-crash high, 
plenty of individual stocks are depressed and have room to go much higher. 
</P>
<P>
* Some housing markets, such as those in California, will continue to be hot, 
while others, such as in oil-depressed areas and the Northeast, will remain in 
slumps. 
</P>
<P>
* Gold and silver are likely to remain dull, but platinum has a brighter 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
* Blistering prices in the art market are due for a correction. 
</P>
<P>
Whether these predictions come true, of course, depends a lot on what happens 
to interest rates and the economy. Economists generally predict that interest 
rates will continue rising into the first part of the year, declining in the 
second half as economic growth slows. A recession may be a threat in late 1989 
and early 1990, economists say, but they have been crying wolf about a downturn 
for months now -- and the economy fortunately has not obliged. 
</P>
<P>
A recession "will happen eventually, but when is still too early too tell," 
says David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources, reflecting the 
gun-shy attitude of many forecasters who have made it a habit of prematurely 
predicting recessions. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a review of opinions on some key segments for small investors: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bonds and savings 
</P>
<P>
Bonds had a good year generally, as "junk bonds," municipals and long-term 
investment-grade corporates posted double-digit total returns (including price 
appreciation and yield). 
</P>
<P>
Savers are enjoying among the highest yields in short-term investments in 
years, thanks to the Fed's tight-money policies. Yields on three-month Treasury 
bills, for example, recently hit 8.22%, the highest in 3 1/2 years. Recent 
9%-plus yields on two-year Treasuries have topped those on 30-year issues. 
</P>
<P>
Money market funds also look great, yielding an average of 8.52%, more than two 
percentage points better than the 6.20% average yields for bank money market 
deposit accounts. The spread normally is less than 1 point, but now is higher 
because money market funds generally move up faster in a rising interest rate 
environment, says Susan M. Cook, editor of Donoghue's Money Fund Report. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally expect short-term rates to continue rising well into the 
first half of this year. But toward mid-year, they say, interest rates should 
begin to decline, making money market funds and short-term Treasuries somewhat 
less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, some advisers say, investors should consider buying long-term 
Treasury issues. Even though they yield less than short-term issues now, they 
are a good way to lock in high yields, and they will gain in value once 
interest rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
For conservative investors who stick only to safe, federally insured bank 
certificates of deposit, the outlook is both good and bad. Banks will continue 
to be slow in boosting CD rates to keep up with rises in the prime rate and 
other market interest rates, says Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate 
Monitor. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to believe that banks in '89 will suddenly get religion to 
help the consumer," Heady says. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, those who shop for the highest-yielding CDs nationwide are 
finding that troubled institutions no longer dominate the list of firms with 
highest savings rates. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the percentage of troubled Texas thrifts on the lists of 
institutions with top-yielding CDs has plummeted from 75% to 13%, Heady says. 
They have been replaced by much-stronger Northeastern institutions, who are 
boosting rates to attract deposit money that can then be loaned out to fuel 
that region's bustling economy. That trend should continue this year, Heady 
says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stocks 
</P>
<P>
Surprising many experts, stocks had a good year last year, with Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500-stock index gaining 16.61% with dividends reinvested. The Dow Jones 
industrial index closed at 2,168.57, close to its post-crash high of 2183.50. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no consensus that the good times will continue rolling. 
</P>
<P>
Even normally bullish brokerage houses disagree. Dean Witter, for example, 
leads the bulls in suggesting that investors put 71% of their assets into 
stocks, versus 25% in bonds and only 4% in cash equivalents. But over at Paine 
Webber, bearish analysts advise only 14% in equities, versus 35% in bonds and a 
whopping 51% in cash equivalents. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, experts are looking at much of the same data but are coming to 
different conclusions. The bulls see low price-earnings ratios (stock prices 
divided by earnings per share) on the S&amp;P 500 of about 12, down from above 
20 before the crash and more than 15 after the crash. They also cite strong 
gains in corporate profits and cash flow, and predictions that takeovers will 
continue at 1988's hot pace. 
</P>
<P>
The bulls also point to the high degree of pessimism among investment advisers. 
Such bearishness is actually bullish, they say, because it means that a lot of 
selling has already occurred. "A lot of people have a lot of cash, and that's a 
mistake," says John D. Connolly, chairman of the investment policy committee at 
Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
But the bears counter that there is still a lot more cash that could hit the 
sidelines before stocks are ready to take off again. High yields on Treasury 
securities and other fixed-income investments are siphoning off money that 
otherwise would go to stocks. Recent rallies have occured with low trading 
volume and relatively few stocks setting new 52-week highs, they say. And the 
threat of recession and slower economic growth bodes poorly for equities. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing all arguments, some experts are straddling the fence. The Dow, they 
say, will continue to trade in a narrow range between 1,900 and 2,200. 
</P>
<P>
"Until there is some direction from the new Bush Administration on fundamental 
economic issues, such as the budget deficit . . . the market is going to 
continue to trade in a narrow range," says Joseph Hardiman, president of the 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers. "Once we see how these issues are 
resolved, you'll see a (clearer) direction for the market, whether up or down." 
</P>
<P>
The key to investing, many experts say, will be in picking the right stocks 
that will perform well regardless of the overall market's direction. Shying 
away from the market completely -- as many investors have done -- could result 
in many missed opportunities, they say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Real Estate 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for home prices will continue to be mixed, with some markets 
remaining hot while others will stay behind, says John A. Tuccillo, chief 
economist for the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
In California, home prices will continue to post strong gains, although slower 
economic growth will dampen price hikes somewhat, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the influx of new residents, a strong economy and restrictions in new 
housing due to slow-growth measures, California boasted five of the 10 markets 
nationwide with the most price appreciation in 1988. Those five -- Orange 
County, San Diego, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and San Fernando 
Valley -- each posted gains of more than 15%, Tuccillo says. 
</P>
<P>
The Midwest also will show strong increases, but the Northeast and Oil Patch 
states will remain sluggish, Tuccillo says. 
</P>
<P>
As for office buildings and other commercial real estate, many markets remain 
soft due to overbuilding, slow economies and loss of tax breaks under tax 
reform. Accordingly, yields on many limited partnerships and real estate 
investment trusts have been declining. Investors must be careful, because with 
fewer tax breaks, real estate investments will have to make it largely on their 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have the tax factor working for you, so there is nothing to bail you 
out if you make a mistake," Tuccillo says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precious Metals 
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver were among the top performers in 1987, but they flopped last 
year. And this year promises not to be much better, many experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Both gold and silver face plentiful supplies and only modest increases in 
demand. And inflation is expected to increase only modestly, dampening buying 
of metals for their traditional roles as inflation hedges. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, industrial demand for platinum is expected to rise, despite 
a recent announcement by Ford Motor that it had developed a platinum substitute 
in catalytic converters, which account for one third of worldwide demand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collectibles 
</P>
<P>
In fine art, caution is the word for 1989. Prices continued to rise to dizzying 
heights last year, confounding many experts. Sotheby's, the big auction house, 
reported record or new record prices in Impressionist and Contemporary art, but 
strong rises even hit lower price categories. If history is any guide, this 
boom can't last forever, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Stamps, however, posted a modest year, but observers are encouraged by recent 
pickups in prices at auctions, says Elaine R. Boughner, managing editor of 
Linn's Stamp News. 
</P>
<P>
Many types of collector coins also gained only modestly. But rare, top 
investment-grade coins posted double-digit gains, as investors were encouraged 
by improved grading standards, says Keith M. Zaner, editor of Coin World 
Trends. More investors are expected to enter the market this year through new 
mutual funds or limited partnerships, Zaner says. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest collector market? Consider baseball cards. Prices of rare, 
mint-condition cards of such former greats as Mickey Mantle have increased more 
than five-fold in recent years.

What are the best investments for 1989? 
</P>
<P>
To answer that question, The Times asked five investment experts to decide how 
they would invest $10,000, in both conservative and risky portfolios. For the 
conservative portfolio, the experts assumed that $10,000 was all they had to 
invest, and thus they couldn't afford to lose any of it. For the risky 
portfolio, the experts assumed that $10,000 was part of a total $100,000 
portfolio, and thus they could afford to take capital losses. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the experts disagreed on the outlook for the stock market. 
But they all agreed that staying away from the market entirely would be a 
mistake because there are plenty of individual stocks or stock mutual funds 
that should do well, even if the market as a whole heads down. 
</P>
<P>
Here are their picks: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DONALD J. PHILLIPS 
</P>
<P>
Phillips is editor of Mutual Fund Values, a Chicago investment advisory service 
that evaluates performance, risk, expenses and other key measures for 1,082 
mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: With so much money on the sidelines, stocks and stock mutual funds 
should do well again in 1989, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Phillips slips $5,000 into Vanguard Short-Term Bond Fund, 
a no-load (no sales charge) mutual fund that invests in fixed-income securities 
with slightly longer maturities than those in money market funds. But the fund 
could return as much as 2 to 3 percentage points more than money funds, with 
virtually no risk of loss of principal, he says. It has posted average 
compounded annual returns of 10.41% in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips pops another $3,000 into T. Rowe Price New Income, a no-load fund with 
bonds of even longer maturities than the Vanguard fund. It has earned average 
compounded annual returns of 10.33% for the past 10 years. He tucks his last 
$2,000 into Strong Investment Fund, which he describes as one of the more 
conservative funds with exposure to stocks, which constitute up to 40% of its 
portfolio. It boasts an average compounded annual return of 10.72% in the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Phillips splits it equally into four stock funds. Two, Royce 
Value Trust and Gabelli Equity Trust, are relatively new "closed-end" funds 
whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and are managed by 
well-respected money gurus Charles Royce and Mario Gabelli, respectively. As 
evidence of Royce's record, his older Pennsylvania Mutual fund has posted 
average annualized compounded returns of 19.54% for the past 10 years. Gabelli 
Asset Trust had gained 35.47% in the 12 months ended Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips favors two no-load mutual funds. One is Nicholas Limited Edition, a 
2-year-old small-company stock fund managed by Albert Nicholas, whose older 
Nicholas Fund has posted a compounded annual return of 20.23% over the past 10 
years. The other is GIT Equity-Special Growth, another small-company fund that 
has posted a compounded annual return of 14.9% over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GERALDINE WEISS 
</P>
<P>
Weiss, editor and publisher of Investment Quality Trends, a La Jolla 
newsletter, is a leading expert on dividend-oriented investing. Her 
newsletter's recommendations were up 21.2% in 1988 through October, according 
to Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter that tracks performances of other 
newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: While the market as a whole has more room to fall than to gain, many 
stocks are undervalued and have little downside risk. The key is to find stocks 
whose dividend yields are at levels where their historical trading patterns 
show they were near the bottom in price and thus undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Weiss sticks to simplicity: She puts it all in insured 
savings accounts or certificates of deposit. She likes to keep her CD 
maturities staggered so that some cash is always coming available. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Weiss taps nine stocks. Her first choice, for $1,500, is 
Bristol-Myers, a company that consistently raises dividends and is historically 
undervalued with a dividend yield of about 4.5% (she considers 4% or more to be 
levels at which it is undervalued). For another $1,500 she taps Xerox, which is 
undergoing a turnaround, lowering costs and increasing profit margins. Its 
yield of 5.5% makes it highly undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss splits her remaining $7,000 equally among seven blue chip stocks that she 
considers to be close to undervalued levels, based on dividend yields. They are 
Schlumberger, Texas Utilities, Houston Industries, Baxter International, 
International Business Machines, American Medical International and Eastman 
Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHN W. ROGERS JR. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, at age 30, is a rising young star in mutual fund management. His 
Calvert Ariel Growth, a small-company growth stock fund, was up 31.83% this 
year through Dec. 9, among the year's top performers. That followed a 11.4% 
rise in 1987, a strong gain in a year when the crash made losers of many stock 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Select stocks of quality companies that enjoy solid market shares in 
stable, non-cyclical businesses, but that are also undervalued and followed by 
few analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Rogers places $4,000 into money market funds. The rest 
goes into two conservatively managed stock mutual funds with excellent 
long-term reputations that he expects will continue to do well even in a down 
market. "It's nice to have growth as part of your portfolio," even if it's your 
first $10,000, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers puts $4,000 of the remainder in Acorn Fund, a no-load fund with domestic 
and international stocks that has posted a compounded annual return of 18.78% 
in the past 10 years. The other $2,000 goes into Evergreen Total Return, a 
no-load stock and bond fund with a compounded annual return of 17.99% in the 
past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Rogers divides his risky $10,000 evenly between seven stocks. 
One of his favorites is Clorox, the bleach maker with a strong cash flow and 
balance sheet. Its share price has been beaten down somewhat by analysts' 
concerns that earnings will be negatively impacted by its planned rollout of a 
new detergent -- concerns that Rogers finds overblown and shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers also likes McCormick &amp; Co., a spice concern flush with cash that 
seems to be followed by few analysts. Next he selects two office products 
stocks: United Stationers, the nation's largest distributor of office products, 
and Sanford, known for its markers and pens. 
</P>
<P>
He also picks two specialty packaging firms: Shorewood Packaging, the largest 
packager of records, compact discs, cassette tapes and music videos, and 
Sealright, the top ice cream packager. Finally, he taps SEI, a large pension 
fund consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NOLA MADDOX FALCONE 
</P>
<P>
Falcone is co-manager of Evergreen Total Return, a stock and bond mutual fund 
that's among the top performers among so-called growth and income funds that 
seek capital gains as well as dividend income. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The stock market will be sluggish, but real undervalued stocks with 
strong dividend yields will hold up well. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Falcone puts $5,000 in two-year Treasury notes, currently 
yielding about 9.11%, higher than 30-year Treasury bonds. She tucks the other 
$5,000 into a money market fund. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Falcone puts it into three "depressed" stocks with good yields 
that will limit downside risk. "I wouldn't mind putting my mother into these," 
she says. The first $4,500 goes into Bristol-Myers, a company misperceived by 
investors who don't realize that it has turned into a high-growth drug company 
with exciting new products in such fields as cancer treatment and orthopedics, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Falcone slips another $2,500 into First Fidelity Bancorp, whose stock was 
pushed down following a recent announcement of a huge writeoff due to poor 
loans. The negative reaction has been overdone, she says. As a extra bonus, the 
stock yields about 7.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Her last $3,000 goes to Springs Industries, a towel and comforter maker that 
recently bought a company that makes industrial fabric used in electronic 
circuit boards, aerospace construction and marine industries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHN D. CONNOLLY 
</P>
<P>
Connolly is chairman of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter 
Reynolds, currently among the most bullish of Wall Street investment firms. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Stocks will do well largely because interest rates will begin to 
decline in coming months. At that point, he says, investors will pull money out 
of short-term fixed-income investments and put it into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Connolly socks it simply into one-year CDs, which have a 
better return than Treasury bills. "If you can't afford to lose, you can't 
afford to play" with stocks and other higher-risk, higher-return investments, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Connolly divides it equally among five stocks that he considers 
undervalued with price-earnings ratios (stock price divided by earnings per 
share) far under what he thinks they should be. 
</P>
<P>
The first, Price Co., is a retailer that he expects to enjoy 25% earnings 
growth. Next he tabs Computer Associates, the nation's biggest independent 
supplier of systems software. 
</P>
<P>
Connolly also likes H. F. Ahmanson, a strong savings and loan firm that could 
benefit from lower interest rates and a resolution of troubles plaguing the 
S&amp;L federal deposit insurance system. His fourth pick is Schering-Plough, a 
drug firm that he expects will post 20% annual earnings growth in the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
His final selection is Monsanto, a chemical and drug firm that has been hurt by 
adverse rulings on an intrauterine device. It is selling far under the price 
shareholders would get if the company was broken up, Connolly says.

<P>
In the advertising industry, 1989 may best be described as the year of the 
poacher. Because most executives are expecting billings growth of only 6% to 
7%, there are increasing suspicions that the only sure-fire way to grow larger 
in 1989 will be to steal the business from someone else. 
</P>
<P>
Already, a slew of agencies are chasing after all or parts of the $200- million 
Burger King business that is now up for grabs. And in mid-December, 
Admarketing, a Los Angeles ad agency, dumped the $15-million HomeClub ad 
business in order to take away the more lucrative, $25-million Home Depot 
advertising account from a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Also, as advertising giants like Kraft, Pillsbury and RJR Nabisco continue to 
mix it up in the buyout arena, a number of client conflicts could arise, 
forcing some ad agencies to make tough decisions on which clients to keep -- 
and how to keep all clients happy. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, advertising executives expect that their clients will continue to 
spend more money on various forms of sales promotion and direct marketing -- 
and less in more conventional forms of advertising such as network television 
and radio. BRUCE HOROVITZ

The cable television industry should continue to show large profits with the 
higher rates now charged for basic service. Prospects for local TV station 
advertising revenues remains open, however, with some experts predicting a year 
of small or flat growth. The national broadcast advertising that sustains the 
TV networks is expected to rise a slight 4.5%. With as many as 30 network 
affiliate stations up for sale, prices paid for stations may be sharply down, 
after the go-go advances of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the newspaper business have been candidly predicting a couple of tough 
years ahead, because of the rising cost of newsprint and postage, as well as 
the recession that many economists expect to begin in the second half of 1989. 
In addition, the merger boom of recent years has reduced the volume of 
advertising done by such key newspaper clients as supermarkets and department 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
In book publishing, a shining light may be the textbook segment, which is 
expected to be helped by demand from the baby boom "echo" -- the children of 
baby boomers, now entering school in growing numbers. Some analysts are looking 
for the general aging of the American population to also help popular hardback 
sales, since older people are the most avid readers. PAUL RICHTER

Shoppers can look forward to some bargains in the coming year. That's because 
retailers, after a spate of buyouts and mergers, are loaded with debt and must 
focus on short-term cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's consolidation is expected to continue apace in 1989, with more 
linkups between real estate developers and merchants, similar to last year's 
epic joining of Toronto development firm Campeau Corp. and Federated Department 
Stores. Mergers and store closings, with resultant loss of jobs, can be 
expected particularly in areas such as Denver and Houston that are still 
afflicted by oil-related woes. 
</P>
<P>
At stores that are trying to boost profit margins such as Bullock's (now owned 
by R. H. Macy &amp; Co.) and Robinson's (a May Department Stores division), 
more development of private label merchandise will be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, pent-up demand should lead to a modest rebound in the women's 
clothing business, which has been in the doldrums for well over a year. 
(However, any improvement there would be offset by weakness in hard goods.) The 
return to classic, feminine fashions bodes well for accessories. MARTHA GROVES

In personal computers, look for more and better sound. Increasingly, PCs are 
coming equipped with special sound chips that alow them to "talk," provide 
special sound effects for games and even play music on compact discs. Compact 
discs will also become a more popular form of storing data. Erasable optical 
discs are also expected to hit the market for the first time in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Personal computers will also increasingly use the Unix operating system, a 
sophisticated software base developed nearly two decades ago in the 
laboratories of AT&amp;T. Until the last couple of years, Unix had been used 
primarily on large computer systems, but with the increasing power of 
microprocessors, the PC is now able to take full advantage of this complex and 
powerful system. 
</P>
<P>
This year is also expected to see the arrival of portable digital audio tape 
players from Japan, where they are already extremely popular. Cellular 
telephones are expected to be one of the most popular consumer electronics 
items in 1989. Experts expect them to drop significantly in both price and 
size. CARLA LAZZARESCHI

INNOVATIVE DESIGNS CAN ENLIVEN EVEN THOSE DIFFICULT BUILDINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
What's an architect to do when designing a building for a socially undesirable 
or an aesthetically ugly activity? 
</P>
<P>
"Do you disguise, say, a sewage treatment plant's function by prettying it up 
with fake mansard roofs and roses 'round the door?" architect Anthony Lumsden 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Or do you take the more sophisticated route of developing a design that 
honestly expresses what goes on inside, and find a way to turn that action into 
interesting architecture?" 
</P>
<P>
Lumsden, who advocates the latter, is chief of design for Daniel, Mann, Johnson 
&amp; Mendenhall, an engineering and architecture company overseeing the 
$600-million modernization of the Hyperion waste-water treatment plant in El 
Segundo. By 1998, the firm will have supervised the completion of more than 40 
new buildings at the site, part of the city's $2-billion public works program 
to upgrade Los Angeles' ailing sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
"Hyperion has always been shrouded in mystery," said Mary Anne Pierson, 
recently appointed to develop a public tour program of the 144-acre facility 
wedged between the city of El Segundo and Dockweiler State Beach. "To most 
people it's a smelly place where dirty things happen -- a kind of pollution 
factory. Hyperion's function is so unattractive, the place is not even named on 
the standard Thomas Bros. city map." 
</P>
<P>
That negative image will change with Hyperion's new generation of architecture, 
Pierson believes. 
</P>
<P>
One of Lumsden's first designs is the warehouse and maintenance facility on the 
prominent corner where Imperial Highway joins Vista del Mar Boulevard. The 
long, low, largely windowless building, soon to be completed, is enlivened with 
imaginatively sloped metal-clad roof surfaces, curved stucco walls and bold 
primary colors. 
</P>
<P>
"The structure's shapes are sculpted into forms that engage the eye of the 
passing motorist," Lumsden explained. "Instead of the usual boring industrial 
facility, we have a building that adds to the streetscape without pretending to 
be a nursing home or an upscale shopping center." 
</P>
<P>
Other structures being built by the firm include a 200-foot-long compressor 
building that sits between the aeration basins where the active organic 
"sludge" is blasted with high-pressure oxygen and "clarified" for secondary 
treatment into inert matter. Sleek yet muscular, the compressor building's 
aluminum rooftop drums and loops of high-tech piping give the impression of a 
clean yet honest energy that does not deny the building's function. 
</P>
<P>
Lumsden and his firm are not neophytes in the art of transforming ugly duckling 
buildings into architectural swans. Many designers regard the Tillman Water 
Reclamation Plant in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area of Van Nuys, built by 
DMJM in 1984, as the most attractive public service facility in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Set in a Japanese garden, the Tillman administration and laboratory building is 
the centerpiece of a plant that recycles waste water. Lumsden's trademark 
sloped metal roofs and sleek concrete curves express the building's technical 
function, yet integrate the design into a park-like landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"At Tillman we made an architectural play of glass and metal folds and ripples 
wrapped around an exposed structural skeleton," he said. "This envelope 
cascades over the building's bare bones as a metaphor for the facility's 
water-reclaiming activity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A New Spirit 
</P>
<P>
Tillman's acclaim sparked a new spirit among those concerned with the 
architecture of the city's public service projects. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Department of Water and Power has upgraded the design 
level of many of its sprawling facilities. An architectural exhibit in the 
DWP's downtown headquarters displays five major planned developments crafted to 
a standard well above the department's post-World War II norm. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Generating Station in Altadena by Miralles Associates Inc., the 
Valley District Headquarters in Van Nuys by Ellerbe-Becket Associates, and the 
Sun Valley District Headquarters by Leason Pomeroy Associates are among the 
best of the new DWP designs. All of these potentially unattractive projects 
manage the difficult trick of being architecturally honest and aesthetically 
pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past the DWP often showed us buildings that were, quite frankly, 
hokey," said Merry Norris, president of the city's Cultural Affairs Commission, 
which has the statutory right of design approval over all buildings proposed on 
public land. "They were so dishonest in character -- generating stations 
masquerading as country clubs, for instance -- that we had to reject them out 
of hand." 
</P>
<P>
According to the commission's architectural guidelines, the design of any 
city-financed building must be "true to the nature of the activities it 
contains," use the best materials available within the budget and take account 
of the buildings, streets and landscapes that surround it "to create pleasant 
environments for people who may work in the project and for those who visit and 
pass by." 
</P>
<P>
In the last year or so, Norris said, the DWP has made "a truly herculean effort 
to raise the level of its submissions to the commission. It's truly marvelous 
that the public sector has at last begun to set an example of architectural and 
social quality in its projects." 
</P>
<P>
The Cultural Affairs Commission also has become far more involved in the issues 
of quality design, observed William Gossy, senior architect for the DWP's 
design and construction division. "The result is that, in the 26 years I've 
been here, I've seldom seen such excitement about good architecture generated 
within the department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several designers recently engaged by the DWP and the Board of Public Works 
credited the Cultural Affairs Commission for greatly strengthening their hands 
in dealing with the city's public service facility bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission kept rejecting bad designs until the agencies got the message," 
Lumsden said. "The priority of public architecture has been lifted from the 
dumps to the top of the pile. Ugliness and dishonesty are out the window, at 
last."

FOR SHIRLEY TEMPLE BLACK, A REPRISE OF A STAR ROLE IN PASADENA 50 YEARS LATER

A youngish TV reporter settled himself opposite Shirley Temple Black in the 
parlor of Tournament House in Pasadena, where she was sailing cheerily through 
a morning of obligatory interviews, and suggested for openers, that, good 
grief, she'd been around forever and now she was grand marshal of the Rose 
Parade for the second time, after Fifty years and. . . . 
</P>
<P>
To which Black, who is now 60, replied, enjoying her own joke, "Yes, I'm one of 
the oldest living Americans." 
</P>
<P>
An American icon at an age when most Americans aren't yet collecting Social 
Security checks, Black is not one to dwell in the past. As she puts it, 
"Looking over my shoulder is not my style." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, she was the dimpled charmer who lifted Depression-era spirits and 
sat on the laps of so many world leaders that, she later observed, "It's a 
wonder I ever learned to walk." 
</P>
<P>
Today, she is more apt to be talking about peace, help for the homeless and the 
hungry, preservation of the environment, halting the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Nippy, Overcast Day 
</P>
<P>
But on this particular morning, two days before today's centennial Rose Parade, 
Black was happy to reminisce: It was Jan. 2, 1939, and the adorable 10-year-old 
moppet, wearing a white ermine coat with matching muff, a white hat atop her 
perfect curls, was riding as grand marshal at the head of the 50th Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
She recalled: "The float I was on was spectacular, covered with roses" (2,500, 
shading from red to pink) with a dais of gardenias, "my favorite flower." The 
day was nippy and overcast -- rain would hold off until the parade had ended -- 
but, Black said, "there was a little heater at my feet, covered with flowers. 
It was cozy and warm and everything smelled beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
"I waved diligently for about 2 1/2 hours," she added, noting she learned to 
cover the record crowd of 1.2 million along the route by adopting the "Queen of 
England" technique, tracing a slow, sweeping arc with one arm. "You can get a 
whole lot of people that way. And I love all people. There are some I don't 
like, but I love all people." 
</P>
<P>
She also "loved the horses and the beautiful saddles and all the silver." 
(Three years earlier, she had been given her first horse, a Shetland pony she 
named Spunky.) 
</P>
<P>
And she "loved" being the grand marshal and wearing a big badge with a rosette 
even though, prodded now for more details, she summarized it like the pro she 
always was: "It was dark. I was taken to the float and put on it. And I did my 
job. My car, or truck, or whatever it was under all those flowers, didn't break 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Her parents had insisted on security precautions, and safe she was, with Leo 
Carrillo, "one of my best friends," riding his horse close by. He gave her a 
Western outfit, chaps and all, and, she says, "I still have it." Clopping along 
right behind her float was Los Angeles Sheriff Eugene Biscaluiz with his 
mounted posse. 
</P>
<P>
It was, by all reports, a spectacular parade -- 5 miles long, with 65 floats 
and 18 bands, a spectacle of such proportions that one journalist was moved to 
write, "The 1939 Tournament of Roses probably never will be excelled." 
</P>
<P>
The flower-decked floats had drawn gasps from spectators. Santa Barbara had 
entered a Taj Mahal; Laguna Beach had recreated Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last 
Supper." Camp Baldy's entry had depicted Whistler's Mother. Burbank had rolled 
off with the sweepstakes for its tally-ho pulled by four prancing snow-white 
floral steeds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
She Likes to Steer 
</P>
<P>
But what was Shirley Temple thinking as she rode at the head of that parade? 
Well, she recalls, "I knew I was part of a very important tradition." Then she 
added, "And I would have preferred to steer. I like to steer everything, 
trains, boats. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And, as she had earlier told the crowd at Pasadena Kiwanis Club's 1989 kick-off 
luncheon, being grand marshal "has a few disadvantages. It is no job for 
someone who likes to march. I really loved to march." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she observed, "You don't get to see the parade, all that happens back 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Having said all that, she was, Black emphasized, "thrilled" when 1989 
Tournament of Roses President John H. Biggar III came calling at the Blacks' 
home in Woodside in Northern California with an invitation to be grand marshal 
once again. Her answer, she said, was an "instant yes." 
</P>
<P>
When Lathrop K. Leishman, tournament president in 1939, was looking for a grand 
marshal, he recalls in "Tournament of Roses: The First 100 Years," a centennial 
history, "There was no name in America as big as Shirley Temple. . . . I 
decided she should be our grand marshal -- if we could get her." 
</P>
<P>
They got her, thus scoring the coup of having as grand marshal the child star 
who had been No. 1 at the box office for four straight years, topping such 
superstars as Clark Gable and Robert Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
And as Biggar noted at this year's kickoff luncheon, the theme for today's 
parade is "Celebration 100" and the committee wanted a grand marshal who would 
"express the tradition" of the parade. It also sought "a celebration-type 
person, cheerful, uplifting." 
</P>
<P>
Reenter, Shirley Temple Black. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Purple Power Suit' 
</P>
<P>
But this is 1989, and this time around the grand marshal won't be wearing 
ermine. 
</P>
<P>
"The (anti-) fur people wouldn't like it," she says. Instead, she has opted to 
wear what she calls her "purple power suit," bought on her recent 21-city tour 
to promote her autobiography, when she discovered that her 
black-and-white-checked number was dizzying on TV. 
</P>
<P>
And, riding beside her, at Black's request, will be her only grandchild, Teresa 
Falaschi, an 8-year-old who has promised her "Nana" that she will sit suitably 
still. 
</P>
<P>
"Teresa said to me, 'Do I have to ride in the buggy? I'd rather do gymnastics 
all the way.' " Black noted. "She's very energetic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feels Like Child Again 
</P>
<P>
Two horses will pull the grand marshal's surrey -- a conveyance about which 
Temple said, "I guess it befits my age" -- and, as it will seat three, she 
hoped to have her daughter, Susan Falaschi, 40, ride along. Black's husband, 
businessman Charles Black, will be in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
It is not hard to believe Black when she says she feels once again like "a 
child of 10, wide-eyed with honor." She plunged into pre-parade festivities and 
duties with contagious enthusiasm, answering repetitive media questions with 
grace and humor, tossing one-liners, occasionally slipping in a word for her 
book, "Child Star." 
</P>
<P>
She is eager to know how the book reads, mentioning that author Wallace 
Stegner, a friend and neighbor, got her on track, telling her she needed a 
story line to tie together her anecdotes and insisting that she "get rid of the 
dangling participles." 
</P>
<P>
One of those charming anecdotes is about New Year's Eve, 1938, when Shirley and 
a girlfriend, who was spending the night, were whisked off to bed early so 
Shirley would be rested for her role as grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watched Horror Thriller 
</P>
<P>
But the girls were determined to crash her parents' anniversary party, in 
progress below. On their third try, they managed to thwart a photoelectric beam 
that protected Shirley's bedroom at the Brentwood home from intruders. 
</P>
<P>
Creeping down the circular staircase, they peered into the darkened living room 
where guests were watching "Night Must Fall," a horror thriller starring Robert 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, "They were carrying somebody's head around in a hatbox," she 
recalls, adding that she promptly had nightmares about a body-less head. She 
laughs and says, "I had all of New Year's Day to recover." 
</P>
<P>
"Child Star" is no sordid Hollywood tell-all, though Black does write candidly 
about the breakup of her 1945 marriage to John Agar, describing him as a 
drinker and a womanizer. 
</P>
<P>
She also sets the record straight on her wealth: All but $44,000 of the $3.4 
million she earned has disappeared, largely as a result of mishandling by her 
father, George, who died in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But, she is quick to say now, she does not blame him. He was, she says, a man 
of limited education, "an innocent led to slaughter" by advisers. No, she has 
"no regrets" about the lost millions. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other celebrities, Black did not want to write about what she describes 
as "all that psychological stuff -- who am I? Where am I going?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well-Adjusted Woman 
</P>
<P>
She laughs and says, "I started so young, I didn't have to ask." (At age 3, 
little Shirley was plucked from a Santa Monica dancing school and cast in a 
series of low-budget one -- reelers called "Baby Burlesks.") Black now refers 
to this as her "starlet" period, before being signed by Fox at age 5. 
</P>
<P>
What is perhaps most astonishing about Shirley Temple Black is that she matured 
into such a well-adjusted, focused woman. This, after all, was the child who 
taught fractions to Noel Coward, played croquet with Orson Welles, handed out 
Oscars to Disney's seven dwarfs, the child whose doll look-alikes added up to 
$45 million in sales for Ideal Toy and Novelty Co. of New York by 1941. 
</P>
<P>
How did she do it? "I had a super mother," she says. "She kept my head on 
straight." (Gertrude Temple also rolled every one of Shirley's 56 famous 
sausage curls each day and, with two secretaries, answered her fan mail.) 
</P>
<P>
Mother Temple "just dusted off" the adulation, Black said, always explaining to 
her daughter that what people admired was her work. Shirley never saw the fan 
letters. And, each day when she left the Fox lot, she remembers, "I'd get off 
the little frilly dress," pull on jeans "and climb trees" or play cops 'n' 
robbers with the neighborhood boys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ran Before Horses 
</P>
<P>
A self-described "tomboy" and "jock," Black was never more thrilled than during 
the filming of "Wee Willie Winkie," (1937) when, eschewing a double, she ran 
before a herd of stampeding horses. John Ford was the director, she says, and 
"he liked to direct men." But from then on, she added, "he started treating me 
as a macho kid." 
</P>
<P>
She lists that film as one of two favorites among all those she made from her 
first in 1931 to her last in 1949, chiefly "because I got to march so much." 
Her second favorite was "The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer" (1947), largely 
because "Cary Grant was just super to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Watching Black in action -- a poised, outgoing woman in a happy second marriage 
of 38 years, with three grown children, a woman who refers to herself as "a 
good wife, that's No. 1," an observer can't help but make comparisons to 
today's young stars, many of whom are plagued by alcohol and drug problems and 
lifelong conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about 1939 Hollywood, she reflected on it as "a time of innocence." 
Reporters did not probe celebrities' private lives, she says, and "everybody 
was idolized." She looks back on "an enchanted childhood." 
</P>
<P>
She pauses before another interview at Tournament House and checks to see if 
she has remembered to remove the price tag from the new, long white sweater 
with a pattern of stylized red roses that she is wearing over a black leather 
skirt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Practicing Spanish Phrase 
</P>
<P>
Those are apt to be the only red roses she'll get very close to. Yes, she is 
allergic to them, "not the pink ones," just the red ones. Next, for an 
interview with a Spanish language station, she is practicing, in Spanish, how 
to say "Happy New Year." 
</P>
<P>
To a radio reporter from Michigan, she expresses her disappointment that her 
book tour did not take her to Detroit -- "I've never been to Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
In another interview, she demurs on a question about whether she prefers 
Northern California to Southern California, where she was born, saying, "I like 
the whole state." 
</P>
<P>
Will she be rooting for USC or Michigan when she tosses the coin for the team 
captains before today's game? "I'm a diplomat. However, I was born in 
California. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ambassador to Ghana 
</P>
<P>
Black is a professional diplomat, having been during 19 years of government 
service U.S. ambassador to the West African nation of Ghana, a stint she looks 
back on as "the best job of my whole life," as well as a U.S. delegate to the 
United Nations and U.S. chief of protocol, the first woman to hold that job. 
</P>
<P>
One interviewer refers to her years as an "ambassadress" and she gently 
corrects him, explaining she was "an ambassador. Ambassadress is what you 
wear." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, she is fielding another question about her, well, normalcy. "Life has 
been very fair to me," she says. "I've had a very fulfilling life." Yes, there 
have been "some bad times, some sad times," including breast cancer surgery in 
1972, a personal crisis she shared with the world in hopes of encouraging other 
women to have checkups. 
</P>
<P>
People come and go, the room filling with pleasant, low-key banter. Someone 
makes a good-natured reference to her as "The Little Colonel," one of her 
famous film roles, and Black shoots back, "I'm a general now, and a grand 
marshal. Watch it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Congressional Race 
</P>
<P>
Then she is talking sports with ABC's Tim McCarver, telling him she's "a good 
shot" (targets only). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hunt quail," she says later, "but I love Bush." (A lifelong 
Republican, Black ran for Congress in 1967, losing in the primary to Paul 
McCloskey Jr. She was a first-time delegate this year to the GOP National 
Convention.) 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, someone asks what if -- what if it rains today on her parade. It 
won't, she replies. "As an ambassador, nothing perturbs you. If it rains, I'll 
get wet. You'll never know it." 
</P>

A FINE POLITICAL SEA TALE IN AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN SEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Wilful Woman by Michael Talbot (Knopf: $18.95; 354 pages) 
</P>
<P>
"A Wilful Woman" is second in a closely researched series of serious, 
sophisticated and intelligent historical novels recording the settlement of 
Australia. But -- since the characters here are still calling this land "New 
Holland" and referring to aboriginals as "Indians" -- this story has much less 
to do with the matter of Australia as such than with English politics and 
seafaring in the 18th Century. Those readers who remember (or still read) the 
C. S. Forester novels, particularly the wonderful early Capt. Horatio 
Hornblower ones like "Beat to Quarters" and "Ship of the Line" will be crazy 
about "A Wilful Woman." 
</P>
<P>
For those who grew up on Forester (remember, that's C. S. Forester, not E. M. 
Forster), there's nothing more fun than a leaky ship that's gone around a 
couple of capes, stays "hoveto" for pages at a time and makes a perfect 
landfall with the aid of nothing more than dead reckoning and a couple of 
aspirin. It's the mark of a more perfect and simple world, where you've got the 
easy-going (but cool and hip) Blue Jackets, Navy Men, set against the klutzy, 
rule-bound Red Coat Marines, who hate to be on board a ship, don't know how to 
get in or out of a dinghy, live to slaughter innocent passers-by and have bad 
personalities besides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Complimentary Commander 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of novel where the commander of the fleet -- in this case, 
Arthur Phillip, is always "sending his compliments" to some unlucky officer, 
then having a tantrum about why this hasn't been done or that hasn't been done. 
Also the kind of novel that's rife with scoundrels -- in this case they range 
from (1) the churlish, humorless, Robert Ross, commander of the marines, who 
spends all his time building Ft. Ross and figuring out how Cmdr. Arthur Phillip 
might catch some kind of pox and keel over and die, so that he, Robert Ross, 
might become commander of this very biggest -- yet least known -- colony of the 
British Empire, New Holland, to (2) Buck Nash, a former Buckingham Palace 
wastrel, an idle, mean-spirited courtier, who got convicted for wife-stealing 
and was subsequently "transported," who also wants Cmdr. Phillip out of the 
way, for reasons of his own. 
</P>
<P>
The backdrop here is the very beginning of the founding of the Sydney Harbor 
Colony. The plot moves along on three levels: (1) Who's going to win 
ascendancy, Arthur Phillip or Robert Ross? (2) What about all those convicts, 
especially, what about the women? With a ratio of one-to-six in favor of the 
stronger sex, won't all these women, even the one respectable married lady, end 
up raped, murdered and pillaged? And (3) who, of the sundry male convicts, will 
be successful in the colonies and end up becoming a pillar of the state? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kitty's Coalitions 
</P>
<P>
"A Wilful Woman" (the woman in question here is an ex-actress named Kitty 
Brandon, who spends most of her time setting up coalitions between unlikely 
characters), presents an interesting literary or "writerly" challenge. As in 
Michael Wilding's "The Paraguayan Experiment," the prose here moves between 
actual documents of the day, weird, hard-to-read, bureaucratic officialese, and 
plenty of the spoken word in dialogue. But how did officials, prostitutes, 
criminals and marines actually speak in the 18th Century? I'm willing to take 
C. S. Forester's word about how British naval officers talked: After Capt. 
Horatio Hornblower, how could I not? But I had trouble with some of the 
convicts here and with Kitty Brandon herself. That doesn't matter much. This is 
a wonderful book to read, an acerbic antidote to the holidays, a book full of 
low crime, undug latrines and ruffled dignity. 
</P>
<P>
The reviewer presents her compliments to the intelligent readership of the Los 
Angeles Times and respectfully suggests that it take under consideration for 
purchase, Michael Talbot's "A Wilful Woman."

PAT SAJAK AND ARSENIO HALL ENTER THE NIGHTTIME FRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Johnny Carson and David Letterman made it. But not Alan Thicke, Joan Rivers, 
Paul Robins and Phil Cowan, et al. The late-night TV arena and trivia books are 
littered with the bodies of Carson challengers, but that hasn't stopped Pat 
Sajak and Arsenio Hall. This month they plunge into the highly competitive time 
slot after the 11 o'clock news. (Answer to trivia question No. 1: Robins and 
Cowan hosted the late "The Wilton North Report" on Fox Broadcasting.) 
</P>
<P>
Both Sajak, congenial host of "Wheel of Fortune," America's favorite game show, 
and Hall, who broke into late night last year as a guest host on Fox's 
now-defunct "Late Show," plan to avoid direct competition with the mighty 
Carson "Tonight Show." Both say they'll try to provide something completely 
different. 
</P>
<P>
Marla Kell Brown, producer of "The Arsenio Hall Show" points out that 
competition in late-night television is somewhat different from that during 
other "dayparts," as the networks dub the different time periods. 
</P>
<P>
In prime time, for example, the competition is the other networks. In late 
night, "your biggest competition is sleep," said Brown, who worked with Hall 
during his "Late Show" stint after Joan Rivers' ouster. 
</P>
<P>
Sajak, who makes his CBS late-night debut next Monday at 11:30 p.m. with the 
appropriately titled "Pat Sajak Show," and Hall, whose syndicated "Arsenio Hall 
Show" premieres Tuesday at 11 p.m. on KCOP Channel 13 in Los Angeles, say they 
don't plan to unseat NBC's Carson and Letterman, ABC's "Nightline" or even go 
head-to-head with each other. 
</P>
<P>
They just want to find their own audience among the available pool of 
late-night viewers and keep them from falling asleep over their bedtime snacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to worry about Arsenio; we're not going to worry about Carson 
and 'Nightline,' either. We just have to do what feels best for Pat," insisted 
Sajak producer Paul Gilbert in a recent conversation at CBS, where the network 
spent between $4 million and $5 million constructing a new sound stage and 
other facilities for "The Pat Sajak Show," the network's first late-night 
effort since 1972, when it canceled Merv Griffin's show. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the people behind "The Arsenio Hall Show" whether they're drawing up battle 
plans and they give the same answer. "Hopefully there's enough room for 
everybody," said Frank Kelly, senior vice president of programming at Paramount 
Television, where the show is produced. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hall: "I think people place too much emphasis on the competition; I'm 
running my own race. It's a personal best, it's me against me. I'm on after 
Sajak in Chicago (the show airs at various times in different cities) so I want 
him to do well." 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe there's just a little competitive sentiment. "The demographic that 
knows Sajak from daytime TV is people who should be asleep (at 11:30). His 
people are asleep," Hall noted smugly in an interview at his office at 
Paramount. "He probably would do well with a morning talk show. That's what I 
would have done with him if I were a CBS executive." 
</P>
<P>
The Carson camp refused comment on their new competitors. But Robert Morton, 
producer of "Late Night With David Letterman," said there's truth in the notion 
that dissimilar late-night shows pose little threat to one another. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'd be crazy not to care that they're out there," Morton said. "(But) 
there are some shows that, when they're faced with severe competition, are in 
an out-and-out battle -- witness the morning shows, how many different ones CBS 
has tried. I don't think it's that intense with the late-night shows. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we've had Pat Sajak on 'Letterman,' talking about 'The Pat Sajak 
Show,' There is, of course, a competitive spirit. But on the other hand, I 
think he'll bring another audience to late night -- his daytime viewers. That 
can only be helpful to late night. (If) they like his show, maybe they'll turn 
to our show." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Sajak, however, Hall has not been a guest on "Letterman." "I was booked 
(on the show), and then, the day of the announcement that I was going to have 
my own show, they canceled me," Hall said. "At first I wasn't upset about it, 
because this is war. Then I heard that Sajak was on the show. Maybe they don't 
consider Sajak competition . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Morton denies playing favorites. "We don't care about competing shows 
as far as booking -- we have guests from the other networks all the time," he 
said huffily. He acknowledged, however, that Hall was originally booked for one 
"Letterman" date, which Hall himself canceled because he had a schedule 
conflict. The only other date Hall had available was nixed because it fell too 
close to the debut date of "The Arsenio Hall Show." "We just thought it would 
looked a little strange to have him one place, and then another right away," 
Morton countered. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Hall and Sajak are deliberately competing -- or which one gets 
an on-air audience with David Letterman -- the pair have definitely assigned 
themselves a difficult task: trying to be different from each other and the 
rest of the pack without really breaking any of the comfortable late-night 
conventions that have made Jack Paar, Carson, Letterman and others bright stars 
long after the moon comes up over Television Land. 
</P>
<P>
And now, he-e-e-re's Pat and Arsenio. . . . Host: Pat Sajak. (Caucasian male, 
42, "Wheel of Fortune" host. Weatherman for Los Angeles' KNBC-TV 1977-81 and 
prior to that at WSMV-TV in Nashville.) 
</P>
<P>
Network: CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Time: 11:30 p.m. Running Time: 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sidekick: Yes (Dan Miller, former news anchor and Sajak colleague in Nashville; 
briefly held an anchor position at Los Angeles' KCBS-TV in 1986, but was fired 
following a messy management coup at the station). 
</P>
<P>
Studio Orchestra: Yes (The Tom Scott Band, all-male, jazz-rock-fusion). 
</P>
<P>
Desk for the host: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Style: Neo-Jack Paar. Broad demographic appeal. Guests ranging from show-biz 
superstars to political figures, authors, scientists and the man- or 
woman-in-the-street. Sajak, who worshiped Paar as pre-Carson host of "The 
Tonight Show" while a child growing up in Chicago, hopes to bring back the good 
old days of late-night talk -- when guests were entertaining, conversation was 
gracious and nobody ever broke the host's nose by throwing a chair at him. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the producers of the "Pat Sajak Show" considered a radical move: 
Instead of seating guests on the left side of Sajak's desk -- the way Johnny 
Carson does on "The Tonight Show" -- Sajak's people wanted to put guests on the 
right side, just to make things a little different. 
</P>
<P>
They decided against it. "I swear, it was like looking into a mirror, we're so 
used to seeing it the other way," said Sajak. "It just looked weird." 
</P>
<P>
Weird is the last thing "The Pat Sajak Show" wants to be. It enters late-night 
TV with the philosophy that the traditional talk-show format is not broken and 
needs no fixing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the show's producers seek to minimize Sajak's identification with 
"Wheel of Fortune," the new Pat Sajak will basically be the old Pat Sajak. 
Coordinating producer David Williger said any image changes will be subtle, if 
detectable. Sajak usually wears double-breasted suitcoats and a pocket 
handkerchief on "Wheel." On "Sajak," he will wear mostly single-breasted coats 
sans handkerchief. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mischler, CBS vice president of advertising promotions, described the 
show's promotional campaign as equally low-key to avoid what he calls 
"anticipointment" -- or unrealistic viewer expectations. "The problem with that 
is, they watch the first night and they never come back again," he said. 
"That's why 'Thicke of the Night' failed; they trumpeted the Second Coming, and 
there was no Second Coming." 
</P>
<P>
Sajak considered the idea of having no sidekick. He considered the idea of 
having a woman sidekick -- but after years on "Wheel" opposite Vanna White, 
decided that viewers might find another woman disconcerting, "as though Vanna 
and I had gotten a divorce or something" (although Sajak will be replaced on 
the daytime "Wheel of Fortune" by ex-football star Rolf Benirschke, he will 
continue to host the night-time show). 
</P>
<P>
Sajak also thought the good-natured ribbing between male host and female 
sidekick might be misconstrued: "If I'm needling some guy, it's two guys having 
fun -- but if I'm needling a woman, I'm a cad, and if she's needling me, she's 
a bitch," Sajak said. Eventually he settled on old friend Dan Miller, a 
quintessential authoritative newscaster whose towering height and rich 
Nashville-tinged voice provides vivid contrast to Sajak's elfin charm and quick 
wit. 
</P>
<P>
Sajak said the show will make ample use of CBS' location in the Fairfax 
district, conducting live interviews from the studio via microwave link-ups 
with the locals, from melon merchants at Farmer's Market to the punks of 
Melrose Avenue. The producers have purchased a helicopter to pay impromptu 
visits to earthquake sites and other areas of note. Sajak plans to do for CBS 
Television City what Carson did for beautiful downtown Burbank. And Steve Allen 
once did for Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Sajak" producers eventually hope to develop their own signature bits 
along the lines of Letterman's "Stupid Pet Tricks," Sajak plans to keep his 
show traditional -- even returning to the 90-minute format earlier used by Paar 
and Carson to allow guests enough time to develop a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at Jack Paar's house a couple of weeks ago, and we watched some of his 
old shows," Sajak said. "You can't do it quite the same way anymore -- things 
have changed, attention spans have shortened. But you can get a little of that 
flavor. The one thing we did not do was say, 'What can we do to break new 
ground, what can we do to be radical?' This format has been working in one form 
or another for 35 years." Host: Arsenio Hall. (Black male, 30, most popular 
guest host of Fox Broadcasting's "Late Show Starring Joan Rivers" following 
Rivers' ouster. Turned down regular hosting position on "Late Show" to pursue 
movie career; most recently starred with best friend Eddie Murphy in the 
box-office hit "Coming to America.") 
</P>
<P>
Network: Syndicated. 
</P>
<P>
Time: In Los Angeles, 11 p.m. on KCOP Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
Running Time: 60 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sidekick: No. 
</P>
<P>
Studio Orchestra: Yes (Hall describes the band as unusual because it features 
women: "I have a sexy lady on drums, I have a sexy lady on keyboard" . . . ). 
</P>
<P>
Desk: Absolutely not. 
</P>
<P>
Style: Hall plans to create the hipness of Letterman without his hard-edged 
cynicism. Hall describes himself as just a star-struck boy from Cleveland 
beneath all the Hollywood glitter. Although guests will be wide-ranging, as on 
"Sajak," Hall expects his show to have a slightly younger demographic appeal 
due to his own freewheeling, desk-less approach to interviewing. Hall boldly 
calls himself "The Martin Luther King of comedy," and plans to eliminate racism 
and sexism from late-night TV by making sure minorities and women appear on the 
show. "There are a lot of people out there who don't have a talk show. I am 
their talk show." 
</P>
<P>
Hall will make two concessions to late-night TV tradition: (a) he will call his 
show "The Arsenio Hall Show," and (b) the announcer will be male. Paramount 
audience research showed that people did not find a female announcer's voice 
"authoritative" enough. 
</P>
<P>
And the title? It just seemed to fit. "We had guys here (at Paramount) who make 
$300,000 a year saying: 'How about "The Arsenio Hall Show?" ' " Hall said with 
a chuckle. "But 'Arsenio Hall After Dark' sounded sleazy. And I thought of 
'Arsenio,' " but they said: 'You're not Cher, pal." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Hall plans to shake up the format. Talking to his guests without 
the barrier of a desk, Hall said he will try for spontaneity with both guests 
and audience. "I just like to wing it," he said in a conversation at his 
ultra-modern Paramount office, with a big-screen music video throbbing in the 
background. "I'm a comedian, I come from the clubs. I know how to work an 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his youthful following, Hall will eschew leather jackets and jeans for 
stylish suits and a more sophisticated look to broaden his audience. Nor does 
he plan to limit his guest list to youth-appeal acts. "I'd love to talk to 
Ronald Reagan," he offered. "There isn't anyone who I would consider too old 
and square. I'd love to do Bette Davis, I'd love to talk to Wayne Newton." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Brown noted that publicists for some of Hollywood's less-than-hip 
stars have begun seeking out the show because they believe Hall can bring out 
"a lighter side to the client" than other hosts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as both host and producer will tell you, Arsenio will do nothing but 
concentrate on being Arsenio. "I honestly think Joan's (Rivers) failure was 
based on the fact that they tried to change Joan, they tried to tone her down," 
Hall said. "I have to be Arsenio. I'm the best Arsenio there is." 
</P>
<P>
"Sajak" head writer Monty Aidem believes that Sajak and Hall, both nice guys 
from the Midwest, have just the right non-abrasive quality and ability to draw 
out other people -- rather than simply go for a joke -- that makes viewers want 
to welcome them into their homes on a nightly basis. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the very successful talk-show hosts are Midwestern people, just like 
Pat," mused Aidem, veteran of "The Tonight Show," "Thicke of The Night," and 
Fox's "Late Show Starring Joan Rivers." "That includes Johnny Carson and David 
Letterman, and, gee, Dick Cavett, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people wear well, you don't get tired of them quickly. It's a real solid 
base to come from."

TRAIL OF AGELESS ART IS NOGUCHI LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, Times Art Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A biological theory known as hybrid vigor holds that a child born of parents of 
different races will possess greater intelligence and physical health than 
either of them. Metaphorically, at least, the productive and long-lived 
sculptor Isamu Noguchi with his Japanese-poet father and Caucasian-American 
mother seemed animated by this force. Born in Los Angeles in 1904 under the 
sign of Scorpio, he died last Friday in New York at 84. 
</P>
<P>
It came as something of a surprise to realize that when Noguchi's ledger was 
closed he had left a protean legacy of artworks scattered across three 
continents and had attained the status of the modern art world's leading 
sculptural patriarch. And not just because he had outlived the competition. The 
quality of his work had never faltered into commercial decoration or 
self-caricature as it has with so many long-lived modern masters. There was an 
incredible steadiness about Noguchi's work, as if it were produced by someone 
-- or something -- ageless, like a mountain stream patiently sculpting its 
rocks. Noguchi's career added up to a fairly vivid endorsement of 
miscegenation. 
</P>
<P>
Hiroshima mon amour. 
</P>
<P>
There is a socio-psychological theory which holds that people born of mixed 
race will be more troubled than their parents, suffering feelings of not quite 
belonging anywhere and never being exactly sure of who they are. Some evidence 
suggests that Noguchi sensed himself as this Marginal Man. Little of the 
autobiographical turns up in accounts of his career. He was married once, 
briefly. He moved about somewhat restlessly, widening his geographical circuit 
until in recent years he divided his time between homes in New York, Japan's 
Shikoko Island and junkets to other countries to work on an ever-expanding 
roster of commissions. He liked Pietrasanta, Italy, and recently caught a cold 
there, which eventually led to his death. 
</P>
<P>
If Noguchi felt displaced, he certainly identified with both poles of his 
alienation. During the Japanese-American internment of World War II, he 
voluntarily had himself confined to one of the camps. It was a wonderfully 
subtle affirmation of his roots and a truly aristocratic gesture of contempt 
toward the American establishment. After that he always looked a bit like a 
prisoner, keeping the top button of his shirt closed without wearing a tie. He 
looked at once like a convict, a Zen priest and a Eurasian polo fancier played 
by Toshiro Mifune. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the decades he was around one was barely aware of him. His image 
lacked the dramatic presence of the volcanic Picasso, the bear-like charm of 
David Smith or the trendiness and wit of Claes Oldenburg. Noguchi was like a 
shadow cast on the floor through the light from an open door, enigmatic and 
without substance. 
</P>
<P>
What was he up to? 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Minneapolis' Walker Art Center organized an exhibition whose travels 
brought it to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. For many adults it was 
the first opportunity to have a focused look at a possibly minor artist from, 
when was it exactly, the '20s or '40s or sometime and is he still alive? 
</P>
<P>
The show was an authentic revelation. Noguchi had studied with the great 
Brancusi but by the '40s, he was making works like "Avatar," whose forms 
resembled the biomorphic surrealism of Miro while retaining the sensuous 
material elegance of Brancusi. Noguchi seemed to be moving like a vacuum-fish, 
absorbing everything in his wake. In the early '60s, he made forms like 
unshelled snails before anyone heard of Funk. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went. Long before Robert Rauschenberg collaborated with Merce 
Cunningham, Noguchi did sets for Martha Graham's dances, for "Appalachian 
Spring" and "Frontier." They had the skeletal spareness of Giacometti's "The 
Palace at 3 A.M." Decades before art developed a social conscience or an 
awareness that real light and space were sculptural materials, Noguchi designed 
playgrounds. When artists furniture was not even a glimmer in the aesthetic 
eye, Noguchi made lamps. 
</P>
<P>
The years rolled on and Noguchi began to receive larger and more prominent 
commissions. They made it clear that his originality consisted less of pure 
invention and more of hybrid vigor. Squint at a sunken garden at Yale's 
Beinecke Library and it is clearly a minimalist paraphrase of Japanese Zen 
gardens with their raked sand and huge boulders. 
</P>
<P>
Noguchi's work tells us that the individualism and inventiveness of the 
Occident was anticipated in the collectivism and tradition of the Orient, where 
nature itself is regarded as a huge artwork. The artist does not dictate to 
nature. He listens to it and does its bidding. Just set the boulder on edge, 
give it a few taps and it is a sculpture. And we thought it was so 
revolutionary when Duchamp told us the art is found rather than made. 
</P>
<P>
Noguchi came to Los Angeles to work on his plaza for the Japanese American 
Cultural and Community Center and his spectacularly calm "California Scenario" 
in Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza. He did not think highly of his hometown and 
was not a pleasant man to meet. He answered questions with contemptuous 
casualness and seemed to wish to be elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
He came across as a man so aware of his absolute aloneness that the only way to 
survive was to convince himself he had chosen it out of obligation to a greater 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
If one is going to fuse oneself with nature -- to take on the personality of 
the relentless wind or the tireless stream -- it requires a certain 
ruthlessness, an austere humility that can play out as arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
What does it mean that Noguchi made the monomaniacal gesture of establishing a 
museum to himself but then placed it in an obscure section of Long Island City, 
N.Y.? 
</P>
<P>
Noguchi set himself the superhuman task of fusing time and space into an art 
that makes Stonehenge modern and subsumes the idea of modernism to man's most 
primitive impulses, delivering him back -- truly civilized -- to the endless 
cycled rhythms of nature.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: POTOMAC 'POWER GAME' -- RULE NO. 1 IS . . . TAKE CARE OF NO.

What a thrill it is to visit Washington, stroll the Capitol, tour the great 
edifices of liberty, glory in the traditions of democracy and see the elected 
representatives of the people governing. 
</P>
<P>
Or whatever it is they do. 
</P>
<P>
"Before you save the world, you gotta save your seat," says California 
Congressman George Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, yes. Down from the clouds we plummet, crashing into the hard tundra of 
political reality. Miller's pragmatic words, spoken on the premiere of a PBS 
series titled "The Power Game," epitomize what appears to be the primary 
mission of many, if not most members of Congress. Not survival of the universe. 
Not survival of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Survival of self. 
</P>
<P>
Taking care of No. 1. That's the main theme of tonight's instructive hour about 
Congress (at 8 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15; 10 p.m. on Channel 24) opening this 
week's four-part series adapted from reporter/host Hedrick Smith's book about 
the inside workings of Washington. Tuesday's program tackles the Pentagon, 
Wednesday's, such unelected power brokers as the media and Thursday's, the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The drive to remain in office is primordial in politics. Yet Smith credits the 
Congressional Class of '74 -- a group of reformers who changed the rules of the 
power game -- with perfecting the techniques of survival to the extent that we 
now may have only a three-day Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Many members remain in Washington only Tuesday through Thursday, spending the 
other days back home, protecting their incumbencies by informally stumping and 
raising the funds they need for their TV-minded reelection campaigns. The 
survival obsession may be steadier in the House, which has two-year terms, than 
in the Senate, whose members are elected every six years. Yet the obsession is 
shared by both bodies. 
</P>
<P>
The average Senate campaign alone costs $3 million, we're told. Handshakings 
and mailings help. But the cornerstone of the "constant campaign," as Smith 
labels it, is media exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"American politics is money and 30-second spots," laments former Missouri Sen. 
Thomas Eagleton. "The modern young candidates -- the Dick Gephardts, the Al 
Gores -- can talk in 10 seconds, 20 and 30. You just tell 'em what you want, 
and they go click, click, click, click. Old-fashioned politicians like me take 
three weeks to answer something." 
</P>
<P>
Or as former House Speaker Tip O'Neill's one-time media adviser Chris Matthews 
puts it: "The old guys schmooze, the new guys broadcast." 
</P>
<P>
And broadcast and broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Smith sees New York Congressman (and Class of '74 member) Stephen J. Solarz as 
the prototypical media swifty and "master of all survival games." Regular 
viewers of network newscasts will attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
The Solarz mastery includes making an impression on the folks back home by 
shrewdly getting his mug on camera for positive reasons again and again. That 
includes this program, ironically, for even as his power game is being replayed 
and critically analyzed by Smith, the media-smart Solarz uses the camera to 
impressively convey action, movement and concern. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of Congress with less access to national TV than Solarz is 
not left out either. Forget the old-fashioned mimeograph. Republicans and 
Democrats maintain their own impressive media operations that enable their 
congressional members to make and beam back video press releases to their 
constituencies via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Smith calls this "mass marketing with a home touch." The Democrats used the 
technique at their national convention in Atlanta, operating their own studio 
inside the convention center from which office holders and other prominent 
Democrats taped messages for their constituencies or conducted live satellite 
interviews with TV reporters in their home districts. With any luck, they made 
the local news. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite stage in Washington is the Capitol lawn, where tonight we see 
members of Congress in the role of propagandists for their voting philosophies 
and, not incidentally, themselves. One after another, these video hucksters 
queue up before a camera and make virtually identical statements tailored for 
local newscasts back home: "The trade bill is extremely important to this 
country and to my district. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"And," you wish they'd add, "my own survival is extremely important to me." 
</P>
<P>
So important, perhaps, that for many members of Congress the drive to save 
one's seat is so consuming that little time or energy remains for saving the 
world.

TV TALK SHOWS GOING . . . AND COMING . . . ; 
</P>
<P>
THE IMPACT OF TABLOID TV ENDS GARY COLLINS' DAYTIME 'HOUR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"When you have had your fill of TV's tabloid talk shows -- Geraldo's satan 
worshipers, Oprah's weight loss, Phil's transvestites -- it is nice to know 
that you can escape to the common sense tranquillity of 'Hour Magazine' and its 
affable host Gary Collins." 
</P>
<P>
So began the letter from Collins' publicity agent Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Although the show had recently "undergone a bit of a face lift," including a 
title change to "Gary Collins' Hour Magazine" to give it a more personal touch, 
the publicist added there was no change in the show's "core objective: to 
consistently inform and entertain without forcing kids to leave the room and 
without anyone shouting at you." 
</P>
<P>
Eight days later in a midseason surprise, comparisons would no longer matter. 
After 8 1/2 years, Group W Productions told Collins that "Hour" -- seen here on 
Fox's KTTV Channel 11 at noon -- was being taken off the air. The last show is 
Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
From a high of 154 stations across the nation in mid-1986, the program had 
dropped to 104 stations. "Stations were focusing on different program forms," 
Group W President Derk Zimmerman explained, "and, frankly, that's not 
compatible with Gary's style. . . . Gary Collins is a terrific guy, always has 
been, still is. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The clear implication was that Zimmerman was talking about program forms so 
successfully marketed by Phil Donahue, Oprah Winfrey and Geraldo Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that until he got canceled, Collins and his show hardly got 
noticed. No one, after all, would ever toss a chair in the air on his "Hour" 
and break his nose. 
</P>
<P>
Collins apparently lost out by being too nice. To some viewers his 
"tranquillity" translated into dull. As TV Guide sniped last spring, "This is 
the TV talk show that poses the burning question: If host Gary Collins were any 
more low-key, would he still register a pulse?" 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, precisely that kind of blandness that works so well for the 
50-year-old picture-book-handsome Collins as master of ceremonies on the "Miss 
America Pageant" and on the annual National March of Dimes telethon co-hosted 
with Mary Ann Mobley, his wife of 21 years, who was Miss America 1959. 
</P>
<P>
To Collins, who has no apologies for his "soft, service information" show, the 
real irony is that his last week on the air is all about tabloid TV, and that 
he was told of the show's demise while taping shows on that theme. Another 
change "Hour" producers had instituted to keep up with its competitors was 
having assorted "theme weeks." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there was any question in anyone's mind how the changes in the 
marketplace and the format out there had rendered a program like ours, which 
was extremely innovative in a sense when we started, kind of old news," Collins 
said slowly over a recent lunch at Trumps. 
</P>
<P>
He laughed as he recalled the coincidence of the tabloid theme. "It seems that 
the viewing public and producers of those programs have tapped into this 
insatiable desire for stronger formats, stronger issues, stronger 
confrontations, a stronger examination of subject matter and reality subject 
matter. And that was never 'Hour Magazine.' 
</P>
<P>
"So times change," Collins continued affably, "and you have to look way back in 
the woods to not see that the trend's coming." 
</P>
<P>
And what does he think of this trend? "I'm fascinated with some of the stuff. I 
cringe a little at some of the subject matter. . . . I won't give you any 
specifics, but I have a reaction as a human being that 'Gee, that was a little 
far. That was a little too close to the bone.' " 
</P>
<P>
Collins gave the impression of choosing each word with the same care he gives 
to his appearance. Not a color, pattern or sandy hair flecked with gray was out 
of place. He insisted that he is neither angered nor worried about the 
cancellation, but "excited" about the "opportunities." He had "some great 
meetings" with unnamed producers that very morning. Besides, he is the kind of 
guy who "always sees the glass as half-full and never half-empty." 
</P>
<P>
About the only note of wistfulness cropped up when Collins noted that "Hour's" 
ratings in November had gone up a full Nielsen point, meaning 900,000 more 
viewers. "So we really felt we were on the upswing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he didn't do anything to accommodate the trend, Collins replied 
simply and without rancor: "Because our show was never that kind of (tabloid) 
show, nor am I that type of host. 
</P>
<P>
"Each host has had a very individual personality and that's what separates him 
from the rest of the crowd," Collins went on. Asked to define himself as a 
host, Collins said without hint of a boast that he was "inquisitive, sensitive, 
caring, likable, non-confrontational." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think all television has to be on that hard edge," Collins added. "The 
thing that's always separated what I do has been the confrontational element. 
You always knew when you watched our show, it wasn't there. That's basically 
not a part of my character." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed not. On a recent afternoon when the theme week was parents and children, 
Collins had as one of his guests a 20-year-old Nevada woman who was giving 
birth to her second child and was planning to have the baby adopted by another 
woman who was also on the show. There was not a tough question in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Collins' comments were optimistic and encouraging. Collins also 
brought on Valerie Harper and her adopted daughter. 
</P>
<P>
On this show, he introduced a personal note about his daughter Clancy, a 
20-year-old Stanford communications major about to take her junior year at the 
Sorbonne and Oxford. Every time he and his wife bring out the photo scrapbooks 
"within a couple of minutes Mary Ann's in tears, and I'm running to get 
Kleenex," he told viewers. 
</P>
<P>
With Collins, there is the decided sense that what you see is really who he is. 
He said he was spending the Christmas and New Year's holidays with Mary Ann's 
grandmother and family in Mississippi. "For so many years the family came out 
here for the holidays, but her grandmother is 96. Unfortunately, she's one of 
those seniors who has retained everything from the neck up but the body has 
failed. I'm not quite sure which is worse. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The Collinses' next stop will be Africa to see friends they met while filming 
the 1974 TV series "Born Free," and other friends from their work in World 
Vision, the Christian relief agency. "Mary Ann went to Cambodia and I went to 
Ethiopia for them. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Although Collins, the son of an auto parts dealer, was born and raised in Los 
Angeles, he identifies himself as Midwestern and readily points out that "Hour" 
fared better in the middle of the country than in places like New York and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny Carson is probably my all-time favorite (TV host) in the sense I feel 
more close to that type. My family's from the Midwest, he's Midwest. My 
family's from Ft. Dodge, Iowa," he said with obvious pride. "I was the first 
one to be born outside Iowa." 
</P>
<P>
Collins graduated from Venice High School, attended Santa Monica City College 
and enlisted in the Army, where he discovered acting. His Army service included 
a stint as announcer and disc jockey for Armed Forces Radio. Already in Europe, 
he got a role in "Cleopatra" starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. 
After parts in several more movies made overseas, he went to New York and did 
some work in theater. In 1965 Collins landed his first starring TV series, "The 
Wackiest Ship in the Army." 
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the transition from acting to TV hosting. It gave him and Mary Ann 
a chance for "regular hours" and a more stable home life -- and his wife won 
the option of pursuing her own acting career. In the past, she had always 
followed him on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Over his show's long run, Collins had a spate of celebrity guests from Nancy 
Reagan to Fawn Hall, but he's most interested in talking about Laurence 
Olivier. 
</P>
<P>
"He came on and I said, 'I'm so impressed. Having made my living as an actor, I 
always looked to you and two or three others as the ultimate craftsman. I said 
I was 'in awe; I don't know what to call you, Sir Laurence or Sir Olivier and 
he said, 'Just call me Larry. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
He said his show also was the first of its genre to put on regular AIDS updates 
discussing medical developments as well as discriminatory practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my good moments came from putting something on the air I knew I was 
going to have an impact. Medical things to me were the most important. I would 
get so jazzed when I would do one of those things. . . . One of the strengths 
of this show is to bring information to the public that at its least is 
life-enhancing and at its best life-altering. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Collins declined to rate the likes of Oprah, Phil and Geraldo. They each have a 
"different style" and he does not want to talk about that either. "I respect 
'em all for what they're doing. They're obviously doing a bang-up job." 
</P>
<P>
Only on that word bang-up did an edge of sarcasm creep into his voice.

New Year's Eve in San Diego County: 
</P>
<P>
One man was shot 3 hours before the old year ended; he died hours into the new 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A driver was jailed after his brother died in what police described as a crash 
fueled by alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
A quadriplegic was briefly kidnaped in a car by two armed men, and then dumped 
alongside a dark highway. 
</P>
<P>
And a teen-ager, apparently caught up in the noise-and-fireworks revelry of New 
Year's Eve, fired several shots into the air from a pistol. Then he 
accidentally fired a fatal shot at his head. 
</P>
<P>
"This New Year's Eve was a very busy night for us," Lt. Michael Blakely, a San 
Diego police spokesman, said Sunday afternoon as he sorted through a log of 
crime incident reports. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, without releasing any hard figures on the number of arrests, 
law enforcement agencies throughout the county said it appeared that the number 
of New Year's Eve drunk-driving cases had declined.

COUNTY'S 28TH MUNICIPALITY STARTS WITH A BANG, FACES THE CHORE OF UNITING 
DISPARATE ELEMENTS

<P>
Blessed by a harbor, beaches and world-class hotels, all that Dana Point needed 
was a sense of community to tie it all together. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday, Dana Point lacked for nothing as it officially became the 
county's 28th city. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief ceremony aboard a replica of the brig Pilgrim (the first Pilgrim 
carried 19th-Century author and city namesake Richard Henry Dana Jr. to what he 
would later call "the only romantic spot in California") Dana Point's 
five-member City Council was sworn in Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the council's first official acts, Councilwoman Judy Curreri was 
voted temporary mayor by her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
A cannon blast -- actually, a 12-gauge shotgun blank -- marked the birth of the 
municipality as 100 people aboard the square-rigged Pilgrim winced at the roar. 
A fire engine-red Orange County Sheriff's Harbor Patrol boat chugged up the 
Dana Point Harbor channel toward the ship moored at Dana Cove Park, its sirens 
wailing and five jets of water spraying high. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it'll be a great coastal city," said Ingrid McGuire, newly sworn in as 
the city's temporary mayor pro-tem. "I think it's a marvelous omen today that 
the sun is shining. Even the elements are smiling on Dana Point." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the city will get down to the giddy business of collecting millions of 
dollars in hotel bed-tax revenue and making sure that its 26,000 residents have 
enough essential services. A consultant has determined that the city's 
first-year revenue would be about $9 million -- $2 million more than needed to 
provide services at the level they are now under county auspices. 
</P>
<P>
The new council will have some nettlesome problems in governing a community so 
diverse that transient day laborers sleep in fields within view of $250-a-night 
hotel rooms. But nearly everyone in Dana Point is optimistic, given that it is 
entering cityhood as one of the more prosperous new municipalities in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this as probably the greatest city in the United States," Lynn Dawson, a 
member of the Dana Point Task Force for Incorporation, said last week. "We've 
got harbors, hotels, beaches and sun nearly every day of the year. I mean, what 
else can you want?" 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, council members Bill Bamattre, Mike Eggers, Eileen Krause, Curreri 
and McGuire conducted their first act of business by adopting a 2-inch-thick 
set of county ordinances and regulations -- a routine procedure until the city 
adopts its own laws. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the Pilgrim II's deck with hands raised, the council members were 
sworn in by County Clerk Gary L. Granville. Newspaperman Dana sailed on the 
original brig Pilgrim in 1834-36 and published "Two Years Before the Mast," 
based on those experiences, in 1840. 
</P>
<P>
The council will select a mayor and mayor pro-tem Wednesday and participate in 
a ceremonial inauguration at the Dana Point Resort. Fifth District County 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley is to administer the oath of office. The public is 
invited to the free event, at which hors d'oeuvres will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
The council will eventually have to adopt a general plan and hire a city staff. 
For now, the city has hired former Anaheim City Manager William O. Talley as 
its city manager and former Rep. Jerry M. Patterson (D-Garden Grove) as its 
city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The city hall now consists of a trailer at the construction site of an office 
building, where the city has leased space. The city plans to build a civic 
center within 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that I'm nervous," Curreri said last week. "But I am excited and 
glad that we're finally at the point that we can take action." 
</P>
<P>
Getting there has been a long and troublesome journey for Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens who first tried to incorporate in 1961 couldn't even get enough 
signatures on their petitions to qualify for a hearing before the County Board 
of Supervisors, according to Dana Point historian Doris Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Twice more during the next decade, residents tried to incorporate but were 
turned down by the county for, among other things, not having a strong enough 
economic base, Walker said. During that period, Dana Point was little more than 
a sleepy backwater, halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But by the 1980s, the Dana Point Harbor had been built for yachts, the 
Ritz-Carlton and Dana Point Resort hotels had opened and the community was 
beginning to rival other county coastal cities for the lucrative tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1987, Dana Point decided to try again for cityhood. Curreri 
lead a group of residents to the County Local Agency Formation Commission with 
a plan to incorporate just a 3-square-mile area known as Old Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO later added 1.5-mile-square Capistrano Beach and -- in a move that 
outraged adjoining Laguna Niguel -- a 1.5-mile-square coastal strip that 
includes the 393-room Ritz-Carlton and the planned 1,126-room Monarch Beach 
resort. The two resorts are expected to account for nearly $10 million in hotel 
bed taxes -- a major reason Laguna Niguel laid claim to the same strip. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel's claim, however, has been rejected by both the county and by a 
Superior Court judge. Laguna Niguel is appealing further. 
</P>
<P>
With Dana Point's incorporation boundaries finally set, an election was held 
June 7 in which three-quarters of voters approved cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
The cityhood outcome pleased nearly everyone in the community, as it finally 
freed residents from having to deal with county bureaucrats in faraway Santa 
Ana for such matters as street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason people wanted cityhood was to have accessibility to the 
decision-makers," Curreri said. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Cummings, director of the Orange County Marine Institute at Dana Cove 
Park, said the incorporation finally gives him the sense of identity that he 
had while growing up in a close-knit New England town. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel that we now have a city which controls a certain amount of its 
own destiny," said Cummings, who will be master of ceremonies for Wednesday's 
inauguration festivities. "The people running it will be people you see on the 
street every day and who are friends and neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
The self-governing process actually began before Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic, Parking, Renewal 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point's City Council-elect met on several occasions in recent months to 
hear what residents want from their new city. They have cited traffic 
congestion, parking shortages and the need to upgrade older areas. 
</P>
<P>
It will take time for the city to organize, but Eggers and some other council 
members believe they can alleviate traffic congestion quickly. 
</P>
<P>
One major bottleneck, Eggers said, is at the intersection of Coast Highway and 
Del Obispo Street, where afternoon commute traffic often backs up more than a 
mile. Eggers said the city may press the California Department of 
Transportation to widen Coast Highway by restriping the lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The city may also try to speed up the planned extension across San Juan Creek 
of Stonehill Drive, Eggers added, which would give motorists a second artery 
for getting to Old Dana Point from Capistrano Beach. That extension project is 
financed jointly by state and local agencies, so he said the city can help 
facilitate the work by making sure its share of the money is allocated swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, some merchants are concerned that a recent rerouting of Coast 
Highway traffic so one-way northbound and southbound lanes are separated by a 
large chunk of the city's main business district causes traffic to whiz by too 
fast for many potential customers to safely stop, Curreri said. She wants the 
city to install lights on both one-way corridors to slow traffic down. 
</P>
<P>
The city will also need to spend untold money repairing and maintaining roads 
in older parts of the city, City Manager Talley said. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first orders of business will be to study which roads need 
attention, Talley said. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers said the council will get involved in Dana Point's economic development. 
"You can't have a healthy city if you don't have a healthy business community," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers would like the city to establish an economic development committee to 
take a long-term look at the city's business needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tourist Orientation Shunned 
</P>
<P>
One thing Dana Point wants to avoid, he said, is seeing its business district 
taken over by tourist-oriented "yogurt shops and novelty items," as he said has 
happened in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the city needs to bill itself as a "destination resort" that 
will not only have businesses catering to tourists but also to residents. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Conway, a local Realtor and past president of the Dana Point Chamber of 
Commerce, said business is growing in the city. Membership in the local Chamber 
of Commerce, he said, grew from 400 in 1986 to 600 in 1988. Conway added that a 
2-year boom in local real estate has pushed property values to unprecedented 
levels. A three-bedroom home worth $150,000 in 1986 now fetches up to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
But the economic picture is not so bright for everybody in the new city. 
</P>
<P>
In Capistrano Beach, for example, transients are known to be camping under 
bridges and in fields, while Latino laborers congregate in large numbers along 
Doheny Park Road in search of temporary work. Capistrano Beach merchants have 
complained about the laborers, as well as about run-down housing along Doheny 
Park Road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Contrasts in 3 Areas 
</P>
<P>
With pockets of poverty on one side of town and fabulous wealth on another -- 
homes in the Monarch Beach coastal strip on the north side of the city run into 
the millions of dollars -- the Dana Point council will face a challenge in 
meeting the needs of all residents. 
</P>
<P>
But the council may be ill-equipped to do that, as two of the council members 
live in the Monarch Beach strip and the other three live in Old Dana Point, 
said Peg Maynard, leader of a citizens' watchdog group calling itself the 
Coastal Organization Group. 
</P>
<P>
There is no one, she said, to watch out for the interests of Capistrano Beach, 
where 7,000 city residents live. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard, who along with many other members of the group ran unsuccessfully for 
the Dana Point council, said the city should have its council members elected 
by district to ensure fair representation. 
</P>
<P>
But Curreri argued that districting "tends to narrow people's focus and tends 
to encourage political deal-making. I would rather have five people concerned 
equally about the whole area."

BIRDERS TALLY TEALS, LOONS AND THE LIKE IN ANNUAL RITUAL 
</P>

<P>
Loren Hays had been in bed for hours when most people were just starting to 
celebrate New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
His sleep was important. He got up in the darkness Sunday morning, made his way 
toward the coastal wetlands and waited for the sun to rise so he could look 
through a telescope and spot such species as the double-crested cormorant, 
northern shoveler, blue-winged teal, common loon and the long-billed dowitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Hays, a biologist at Cal State Long Beach and for the federal government, 
gathered with his wife, Debra, and five others, including Department of Fish 
and Game wildlife biologist Esther Burkett, for an annual bird count in a 
small, rain-soaked parking lot at the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve near 
Pacific Coast Highway just south of Huntington Harbour. 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas season count, conducted throughout the country by members of the 
Audubon Society, collects valuable data on bird numbers and habitats. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun made its first appearance of the day, about the time many New Year's 
Eve revelers went to bed, Hays' group fanned out over the state Department of 
Fish and Game's wetland reserve to count birds. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups met at other places along the coast to count birds and gather 
information about species. One group group went by boat to make its count 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to have bird shoots around Christmas," Hays said. "They would go out 
and blast everything in sight. In the late '40s or early '50s, someone decided 
that counting the birds might be a better alternative than shooting them." 
</P>
<P>
So each year, members of the Audubon Society and others, who like to call 
themselves birders, go out and count the birds. There are two counts each year, 
one inland and one along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the information that is gathered during the counts is now used as a 
scientific database," Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
The counters carry official tally sheets that list about 180 species of birds. 
</P>
<P>
The advanced birder in each counting group -- in this case Hays -- peers 
through a telescope scanning the wetlands for the birds. Hays called out their 
names as he found them. 
</P>
<P>
It went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
"Five northern harriers. Thirty-five long-billed dowitchers. Thirty-five common 
loon. One bufflehead and twelve northern pintail." 
</P>
<P>
As Hays rattled off the names, Debbie Hays thumbed through the pages to find 
the species and note the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"A red-breasted merganser. A pied-billed grebe. Two surf scoters and an 
American coot." 
</P>
<P>
Then the group moved to a new position. Hays began his search again. He looked 
around the estuary for birds. When he found them, he called out their species 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Hays did not need a book to identify the birds found Sunday. Asked how many 
species he could identify by sight, he modestly replied, "Less than a 
thousand." 
</P>
<P>
Last year was a particularly good one for the coastal counters. They spotted 
214 species, the second highest count in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll come close to that this year," Hays said. "Many of the 
mountain birds are not here this year." 
</P>
<P>
Counting birds is not an easy job, and prospective counters are warned ahead of 
time about the long hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, every daylight hour counts," warned a newsletter for the Sea &amp; 
Sage Audubon Society, a local chapter. "One year, rough-winged swallows, 
northern water thrushes, lesser nighthawks and western screech owls were all 
found as the sun was setting or later. That means four species would have been 
missed if counters had quit early." 
</P>
<P>
"It is the world's greatest hobby, and I've tried about everything," Hays said 
of birding. "No day is ever the same. There's always a surprise. It's the 
thrill of seeing something new or rare, the number of species or the numbers in 
a particular species." 
</P>
<P>
Other birds spotted Sunday included some song sparrows, a black-billed plover, 
a Belding's Savannah sparrow, a great blue heron, ruddy ducks and a brown 
pelican. 
</P>
<P>
Also spotted waddling along the water was one large, white, domestic goose. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the goose, which looked out of place surrounded by the smaller wild 
birds, Hays noted that people who abandon domestic birds in wildlife reserves 
can be arrested by a game warden.

NOTEBOOK: LEVITY CUTS HEARING'S HOSTILE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
By and large, the court hearing that will resume Tuesday for David A. Brown, 
accused of murdering his wife, has been an intensely bitter and heated affair. 
</P>
<P>
The warring attorneys sniped at one another endlessly over the course of four 
days of testimony, beginning late last month. Vicious accusations flew wildly. 
Brown's 18-year-old daughter, who was convicted of murdering her stepfather but 
now claims she was set up by her own father, cowered on the witness stand under 
Brown's sharp gaze. 
</P>
<P>
And even the judge acknowledged that the hostile, emotionally charged 
atmosphere threatened to become more like "a three-ring circus" than a hall of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even in that tense atmosphere of antagonism, there emerged a few moments of 
levity so spontaneous that even the feuding lawyers, the man accused of murder 
and his embittered daughter all had to laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The week's proceedings in Westminster Municipal Court were filled with a stream 
of objections by both defense attorney Joel Baruch and prosecutor Jeoffrey 
Robinson as each complained bitterly about the other's legal tactics. And 
rarely did either miss a chance to tinge a legal objection with a personal jibe 
at opposing counsel. 
</P>
<P>
But on the second day of a hearing to determine whether Brown should stand 
trial for murder, defense attorney Baruch sought to strike a rare, conciliatory 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
As he began to make his point to the court, Baruch said: "Now I know Mr. 
Robinson is a very good lawyer, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He was cut off abruptly as prosecutor Robinson rose from his seat with a wry 
smile on his face. "Objection!" Robinson said. "Assumes a fact not in 
evidence!" 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Baruch was trying, with some frustration, to shake Cinnamon 
Brown loose from the story that she had been telling on the witness stand for 
the last 3 days. 
</P>
<P>
Brown claims that she killed her stepmother only after her father's persuasive 
prodding and, wanting to protect her father, had remained silent about the plot 
for more than 3 years while in a California Youth Authority facility. 
</P>
<P>
Baruch didn't buy the explanation. He disclosed in court that Cinnamon Brown 
has a boyfriend, a young man whom she met in the CYA facility in Camarillo but 
who has since been freed. 
</P>
<P>
And through sharp questioning, Baruch tried to show that the young woman 
changed her story about the killing not out of any concern for the truth but 
because she wanted to get out of prison and be with her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't Cinnamon Brown jealous because the boyfriend is on the outside and able 
to date other women -- and perhaps leave her for someone else? Baruch asked 
pointedly. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, stone-faced and pained throughout most of her testimony, flashed a brief 
smile as she shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
No, she wasn't jealous, she answered quickly. "It doesn't really concern me 
because no one else wants him." 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom broke into laughter. Baruch, a bit flustered, soon moved on to 
another subject. 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon Brown was offering most of the admissions as she talked on the witness 
stand about the killing of her stepmother, but prosecutor Robinson had a 
confession or two of his own. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day of Cinnamon Brown's testimony, defense attorney Baruch was 
trying yet another tack in an effort to damage the credibility of the 
prosecution's star witness. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney wanted to throw doubt on Cinnamon Brown's mental stability 
by introducing evidence that the teen-ager had invented and often conversed 
with a pair of imaginary playmates -- Oscar and Maynard. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, objecting to the use of such testimony as irrelevant, told the court 
he didn't find anything strange about the woman's playmates. 
</P>
<P>
A bit embarrassed, he admitted that when he was younger "I had imaginary 
friends, and, frankly, right now I still have one." 
</P>
<P>
There were chuckles from the judge, the court audience and even Baruch -- 
though many in the courtroom didn't seem quite sure whether to take the 
prosecutor's remark seriously. 
</P>
<P>
And the judge? He agreed with the prosecutor's argument and blocked Baruch from 
bringing any imaginary friends into the case. 
</P>
<P>
The laughs will probably be fewer and further between when David A. Brown's 
preliminary hearing resumes. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Floyd H. Schenk has scheduled a hearing on Baruch's motion to have 
Robinson dismissed from prosecuting the case because of his conduct. The 
defense attorney -- who himself was cited by Schenk for contempt of court -- is 
complaining that the prosecutor has been trying to harass and intimidate him. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony then will resume, with Patricia Bailey -- the dead woman's sister, 
David Brown's alleged accomplice and now his wife -- takes the witness stand.

'89 ARRIVES WITH SANTA ANA KILLING 
</P>

A family argument left one man dead in Santa Ana, and a suspected drunk driver 
caused a fire truck crash in Anaheim on an otherwise quiet New Year's Eve in 
Orange County, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
And, unlike past New Year's Eves, there were no reports of bystanders shot by 
stray gunfire in the county as revelers shot into the sky at midnight. 
Rain-slick roads prompted many to celebrate the arrival of 1989 at home, 
helping to keep weekend casualties down, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police on Sunday were seeking Tomas Bustos Valadez, 32, who they say 
shot and killed his brother, Joaquin, 28, during an argument. The brothers, who 
shared an apartment in the 1200 block of East McFadden Avenue, got into a brawl 
after returning from a party about 1:30 a.m., said Cpl. Charles Jarusek. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Died at the Scene 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Valadez took a rifle from his bedroom and returned to the living room, 
where he shot his brother, police said. Joaquin Valadez died at the scene from 
a single gunshot wound, Jarusek said. 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Valadez left the house on foot with the rifle, witnesses told police. He 
is described as a Latino, 5 feet, 9 inches tall, weighing 150 to 160 pounds, 
with short black hair and brown eyes. He was wearing a gray sweat shirt and 
green pants. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, four firefighters escaped with only minor injuries when a suspected 
drunk driver collided with a fire truck returning from a call shortly before 2 
a.m., police said. The driver of the car, Bruce Russell, 29, of Anaheim, was in 
satisfactory condition Sunday night at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when Russell turned in front of the truck at the 
intersection of East Broadway and South Wayside Place, police said. The fire 
truck was so badly damaged that it had to be towed from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Russell was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Dave Severson said the fire truck had been on its way to the station and 
didn't have its lights or siren on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quiet Holiday 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials throughout the rest of Orange County reported a quiet 
New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. A number of drunk driving arrests were made, 
but officials said there were no other major accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Santa Ana reported 27 drunk driving arrests between 6 p.m. 
Saturday and 3:30 a.m. Sunday. The California Highway Patrol recorded about 50 
arrests during a 48-hour period ending at 6 a.m. Sunday. The tally for New 
Year's Day was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Several law enforcement agencies beefed up patrols over the holidays. The CHP 
added at least five officers to patrol freeways in Orange County to handle the 
rush of holiday revelers on slippery roads, a dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
In Costa Mesa, seven two-officer teams were sent out to look for drunk drivers 
and make arrests, officials said. Other cities with beefed-up patrols included 
Newport Beach, Garden Grove, Buena Park and Fountain Valley.

POSTSCRIPT: LOTTO WINNER STILL HAS HER GOALS -- PLUS A BMW, YACHT AND FIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When 20-year-old Christene E. Lentz of Capistrano Beach won $19.58 million in 
California's Lotto game in August, the first question fired at her at a news 
conference was: "So, you got a boyfriend?" 
</P>
<P>
Lentz laughed and answered: "I probably have a lot of boyfriends right now!" 
</P>
<P>
Today, she is engaged, drives a new car, owns a 43-foot yacht and has bought a 
new home for her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest change is that now I can spend money when I go shopping instead of 
just looking," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The day she struck it rich, Lentz said, she had been wondering how she would 
make the next $200 payment on her silver 1984 Nissan Sentra with $11 left in 
her checking account. 
</P>
<P>
"I had made three monthly payments before it happened," said Lentz, a 
Saddleback College sophomore majoring in theater arts. "The next payment I paid 
it off." Now, Lentz glides around in a white BMW 325i with a black convertible 
top. 
</P>
<P>
It was on Aug. 25 that Lentz and a Riverside truck driver split a $39-million 
Lotto jackpot. She will receive a $783,200 check every year for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always happy," Lentz said last week. "Now, I'm ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
Still living with her parents and working for her mother's company, National 
Aerospace Supply in Anaheim, Lentz has received six marriage proposals -- 
several in jest -- since hitting the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
But the one that counts came from her boyfriend, 19-year-old Charles Cooper of 
Colton, just before the Lotto numbers popped out that night in August. "If you 
win the lottery tonight, will you marry me?" Lentz recalls him asking. 
</P>
<P>
They were engaged Oct. 2 and plan to be married July 15. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, a machinist who works for his father, has been dating Lentz off and on 
for about 2 1/2 years, she said. They began dating while both were high school 
students in Colton, where the Lentz family lived before moving to Capistrano 
Beach last June. 
</P>
<P>
"We had talked about marriage before," Lentz said. "But we didn't have the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Said her mother, Joyce: "I love him. He's every mother's dream. I always yelled 
at her when they broke up." 
</P>
<P>
During the 3 weeks after she won the Lotto, Lentz received a flood of inquiries 
from investors and a ton of missives seeking money. 
</P>
<P>
"You just kind of have to put them aside," Lentz said. "But I read a lot of sad 
things. Most people are too embarrassed to ask you for money to your face." 
</P>
<P>
"Except me," her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Lentz said one of her biggest headaches has been handling paper work now that 
she has a lawyer, a financial adviser and an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
"I also had to prepare a will," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the BMW and the yacht -- which is still in Dallas at a former family 
getaway spot -- Lentz's major acquisitions include a Gucci purse and wallet 
(for $500) and lots of clothes. Her only exotic journey so far has been a trip 
with Cooper to visit his relatives and go sightseeing in Washington and 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"We were gone 4 days, and I missed home," Lentz said. 
</P>
<P>
She also has donated money for scholarships at Fontana Christian School, where 
she went to elementary school, and Colton High School. She set up a trust fund 
for her sister and has made a number of investments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lentz said money hasn't changed her basic goals. "I still want to be a 
theater arts teacher." 
</P>
<P>
She and Cooper plan to finish college and have decided they want four children. 
Lentz hopes to earn her teaching certificate, and Cooper wants to pursue an 
engineering degree. 
</P>
<P>
As for Lentz's family, they are trying to take the windfall in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect her to support me for the rest of my life," said her mother, 
who started her own company 3 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope not," Lentz said. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister, Collene, said she finds all the attention embarrassing. But she 
doesn't mind the money. "I still like shopping too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And what about the Lotto? Does lightning ever strike twice? 
</P>
<P>
Said Lentz: "I played last night."

JAZZ DICTIONARY FOR THE EVERYMAN DEBUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OWEN McNALLY, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weighing in at almost 10 pounds, "The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz" is the 
undisputed, world heavyweight champion of jazz scholarship, a highly readable, 
scrupulously researched two-volume, 1,400-page compendium packed with 
everything you always wanted to know about jazz but were afraid to ask. 
</P>
<P>
About as hefty is the price: $295. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't aimed the dictionary just at the jazz insider. And we don't presume 
that everybody knows what a 'honk' (a loud blaring note on the saxophone) is or 
what a gig (job) is, or even what a clarinet is. We've aimed at a very general 
audience interested in the music," chief editor and musicologist Barry Kernfeld 
said recently in a telephone interview from Oxford, England. 
</P>
<P>
Kernfeld initiated the mammoth project and has devoted the last 4 1/2 years to 
editing and organizing the work, which has been written by more than 250 
contributors from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a labor of love and absolutely all I've done for 4 1/2 years. I'm 
a saxophonist, but I haven't played a note all that time," said Kernfeld, who 
has been on the road promoting the magnum opus. The jazz scholar has been 
plugging the classy product in New York, San Francisco, Paris, London and even 
in a 5-minute appearance on NBC's "Today Show." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to open up the literature for everyone. And we wanted it to be 
wide-ranging, with a lot more than just biographical entries," Kernfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
"We especially wanted it to be even-handed in its treatment of all styles 
because so many people get bogged down in factionalism in jazz. Some people 
hate bop, and some hate everything but bop, and we've tried to avoid that kind 
of divisiveness." 
</P>
<P>
The Grove music dictionaries are to music what the Oxford English Dictionary is 
to language -- a scholarly source revered by many as the ultimate authority on 
matters of fact. 
</P>
<P>
Lavishly illustrated with 220 rare photographs from the celebrated Frank Driggs 
Collection, the handsomely bound volumes -- a bibliophile's delight -- surpass 
all earlier jazz dictionaries and encyclopedias in breadth and depth with its 
4,500 entries, 3,000 biographies, 1,800 discographies and more than 1,000 
cross-references. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its exhaustive Who's Who of jazz from Louis Armstrong to Joe Zawinul, 
the dictionary offers well-written entries on a dazzling variety of topics. 
</P>
<P>
Among these are musical styles ranging from ragtime to free jazz, jazz 
instruments from kazoo to synthesizer, record labels both flourishing and 
defunct, fabled jazz nightclubs around the world and festivals. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 100 magazine-length entries on specialized areas, including 
improvisation (the heart of the matter for jazz), arrangement, harmony, form 
and notation. All are illustrated with copious musical illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
"A small part of the dictionary is esoteric, but we also wanted to reach the 
serious fan who might want more in-depth knowledge of specialized subjects like 
harmony, or about specific things like how chordal substitution works in the 
bop style," Kernfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
If these more technical areas sound too dry, rest assured that there are plenty 
of juicy areas to tromp around in, including a fascinating 11-page essay on the 
role jazz has played in films. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being an invaluable resource book, the dictionary is fun to thumb 
through. 
</P>
<P>
Ardent fans will have a good time second-guessing the scholars and finding 
fault with their judgment about who gets in and who is excluded from this work, 
which is now the official jazz pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to take a critical stand here, but that's what Grove is all about," 
Kernfeld said when asked about the dictionary's process of natural selection. 
</P>
<P>
"A quarter of the book is devoted to non-American subjects, so I've had New 
Yorkers asking me why there are so many Europeans. The English are asking why 
aren't there more English, and the French are asking why there aren't more 
French." 
</P>
<P>
Errors, of course, are the ultimate nightmare for editors of any dictionary or 
encyclopedia, and jazz, as liberated as it is, provides no exception. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most consistently misspelled name in jazz history has been 
Thelonious Monk's unusual first name. 
</P>
<P>
Grove has it right.

Former Channel 39 sports guy Al Janis asked what may have been the unwisest 
question of 1988. Frustrated with all the changes at the station, Janis went to 
his boss and demanded to know whether he was going to be kept around after the 
transition period. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Al, now that you mention it . . . " was the reply, and Al went back to 
clean out his desk. 
</P>
<P>
The moral: Don't ask a question if you don't want to hear the answer. 
</P>
<P>
This is a strong argument for ignoring the urge to speculate about the year 
ahead. Perhaps we're better off taking the experiential approach, blissfully 
letting events sweep over us. 
</P>
<P>
But that would be no fun. As a great philosopher once said, speculation is the 
spice of life (or something like that). 
</P>
<P>
Certainly it is fair to speculate that KFMB-TV (Channel 8) viewers will be 
seeing more of anchorwoman Andrea Naversen in the next year. She has that 
professional, easy-to-look-at, Ice Queen-look, popularized locally by Bree 
Walker. The Ice Queen-look is apparently "in," so there is no doubt Naversen 
will be working her way up the Channel 8 ladder of success, especially since 
current No. 1 anchor Allison Ross' relationship with the station is rumored to 
resemble that of the Bundy family on "Married . . . With Children." 
</P>
<P>
Over at Channel 39, viewers certainly will be seeing a lot more of former 
newspaperman Bill Ritter, who is becoming the station's designated hitter, the 
epitome of Channel 39's attempt to build a hard-news image. Now that Ritter has 
mastered the intricacies of television news -- his hair and makeup look great 
-- he is on the Channel 39 fast track. 
</P>
<P>
Also watch for more of Dave Bender at Channel 39. Bender reeks of perkiness. He 
is perky enough to be a poster child for a campaign to ban caffeine. Bender's 
perky weather reports and perky puff features are already starting to get more 
play, especially since semi-perky weatherman Brian Hackney recently said a 
short goodby. 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of people born to smile 'til it hurts, 1989 will be a big year for 
Bill Griffith and the folks at Channel 10's "InSide San Diego." When Channel 10 
started the show, station officials said they were going to give it at least a 
year to build an audience. The year is up in June, and, following standard 
television operating practice, Channel 10 probably will either can the 
chat-fest, fire the hosts or make it a semi-permanent part of the station's 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The year ahead also will be crucial to Larry Himmel, who probably will get a 
chance to take his new Channel 39 show weekly, and for XTRA-AM (690), which is 
trying to establish its news-talk format amid a general "who cares" sentiment 
among radio listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the "who cares" department, KSWV-FM (102.9) will continue its attempt 
to convince people that modern elevator music is "The Wave" of the future. 
After an initial ratings flourish, listeners throughout the country have been 
opting to pass on "The Wave." The hiring of disc jockey Art Good, local radio's 
answer to Sleep-eze, is unlikely to revive the local version. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, all this is simply speculation, similar to these predictions for the 
New Year: 
</P>
<P>
* Channel 8 weatherman Larry Mendte will be asked to host "The Gong Show," but 
he'll turn it down to take a job in the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
* Channel 10 will rename its 5 p.m. broadcast "ZooNews," and reporter Margaret 
Radford will win an Emmy for a poignant and moving feature entitled "Your 
Friend the Giraffe." 
</P>
<P>
* Frustrated by lack of interest in his new television show, former mayor Roger 
Hedgecock will form a traveling nude mud-wrestling troupe, featuring himself as 
the ringmaster. 
</P>
<P>
* Channel 10's Kimberly Hunt, impressed with the hair dye-jobs of fellow 
broadcasters Jerry G. Bishop and Mitch Duncan -- and tired of being called a 
blonde bimbo by local radio personalities -- will decide to dye her hair 
purple. She also will legally change her name to "Babycakes." 
</P>
<P>
* Channel 39 sports guy Bobby Estill will quit to become the new sports 
columnist for GQ magazine. He'll be fired when he refuses to wear socks. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, you heard it here first. 
</P>

Friday was the last day of local radio traffic reports from the Automobile Club 
of Southern California, the second traffic report service to fold since the 
national Metro Traffic service moved into San Diego a few months ago. "The 
service was no longer unique, so we decided to place the resources elsewhere," 
Auto Club assistant district director Bill Schurmer said. Metro will pick up 
several of the Auto Club's contracts, but local traffic reporter Jon Hoffman 
has landed the gig with KKLQ-FM (Q106) and KNSD-TV (Channel 39). . . . KSDO-AM 
(1130) afternoon talk-show host Stacy Taylor has been one of Kimberly Hunt's 
main tormentors. Friday afternoon, Hunt will be a guest on his show. Meanwhile, 
Michael Tuck will be a guest on Gloria Penner's KPBS-TV (Channel 15) talk show, 
6:30 p.m., Sunday. It will mark the start of Penner's fifth year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It must be nice to be editor of your own paper. Not only did the Tribune do a 
massive puff piece on editor Neil Morgan a couple of weeks ago, but last week 
Morgan managed to get a Page 1 photo credit for a photo of his own mountain 
cabin. And, in Friday's column, he sneaked in a plug for his wife's cover story 
in the January issue of Travel &amp; Leisure.

MUSICAL AND X-RATED SIDES OF A BLUE COIN 
</P>

<P>
B.B. King posed the question of the night Saturday when he sang one of his 
signature songs: "How Blue Can You Get?" 
</P>
<P>
In the first of two New Year's Eve shows at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim, 
King and Bobby "Blue" Bland both provided the traditional response in solid, 
sometimes eloquent sets, well stocked with classics of the genre. For them, how 
blue you can get depends on how much emotion you can generate in a song -- and 
the answer for both was plenty. 
</P>
<P>
For Millie Jackson, being blue has more to do with the profanely outrageous 
comic tradition of Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor than with the musical tradition 
of the other two stars on this triple bill. 
</P>
<P>
How blue can you get? Well, by the end of her 55 minutes on stage, there was no 
question about which Jackson is really Bad. Like Michael, who is no relation, 
Millie made a point of grabbing at her crotch during an X-rated, bump-and-grind 
version of "Something You Can Feel." Actually, she took it a step further, 
getting comic mileage by grabbing at male targets in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson wound up overdoing the saucy and scatological stuff. It would have been 
better to hear more of her gritty funk singing and ardor-filled soul balladry 
-- and less of her salty rapping about male shortcomings and female survival 
tactics. She might have hit a workable balance if she had played it straight 
with her last number, "Love Is a Dangerous Game," rather than turning it into 
yet another rude spoken rap. 
</P>
<P>
In these Sam Kinison days, dirty talk is cheap indeed, while singing voices 
like Jackson's are rare. She may have been breaking ground in the '70s with her 
raw comedy, but there is a greater need now for more moments such as her 
exciting improvisation at the end of "An Imitation of Love." 
</P>
<P>
If brashness is Jackson's hallmark, Bland's is restraint. It served him well in 
a 40-minute performance in which his singing was often stirring enough to 
elicit testifying cries from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
That old-fashioned response was probably prompted by some old-fashioned musical 
virtues. Bland had a crack, eight-piece backing band that moved deftly through 
rich, varied song arrangements. With full-bodied musical output such as that -- 
featuring real horns and a real Hammond organ -- one has to wonder why so many 
contemporary R&amp;B singers settle for emaciated and phony-sounding production 
founded upon tinkling synthesizers and sound-alike computer rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Using understatement rather than big vocal gestures, Bland's singing 
consistently brought emotions into clear focus. Whether pleading for romance on 
the soul-flavored ballad "Share Your Love With Me," or suffering existential 
slings and arrows on "Stormy Monday," Bland sang with conviction and immediacy, 
and his refusal to grandstand added another fine quality: intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
B.B. King made it a happy new year for anyone who loves to hear him play the 
guitar. In his previous county appearance, in August at Michael's Supper Club, 
King was content to be an entertainer, a talkative, gracious host rather than a 
musical dynamo. This time he came to make music. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute set was crammed with liberal guitar solos in King's distinctive, 
clean-but-rough-edged style. Highlights included "You Know I Love You," 
rendered as a lovely, lyrical guitar ballad, and "Why I Sing the Blues," which 
found King skittering up and down the fret board in a playfully rocking 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
King's singing was forceful, although he no longer has the impressive high 
range that he did 15 or 20 years ago. Perhaps he was limited by the sore throat 
that he said was bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
King stuck to older material rather than play anything from his new album, 
"King of the Blues: 1989," and that was just as well. In a crowd-pleasing 
ending, he sang "The Thrill Is Gone," the 1970 hit that brought him to the 
attention of the rock generation, then swung into a funky reading of "When Love 
Comes to Town," the new number from U2's "Rattle &amp; Hum" album that features 
King in a vibrant guest shot.

SHOW SCHEDULE HOLDS HOPE OF A HAPPY NEW YEAR

<P>
A fireboat captain I know (whose firehouse must be the only one that regularly 
posts art reviews) always kids me about my writing. "Why don't you ever say 
something positive?" he jokes. "Just say something nice once in awhile!" 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, I yearn to do exactly that. But much of the art shown in 
Orange County (and just about everywhere else; relax, ye civic boosters!) is 
mediocre. Too many exhibitions are ineptly conceived and lacking in 
intellectual substance, and the art too often tends to be timid, boring and 
parochial. 
</P>
<P>
These days, when we do get worthy art to look at, it is frequently packaged as 
an homage to a collector's good taste. Collectors have an important place in 
the art world, for obvious reasons. Art patrons have played a major role in the 
history of art. 
</P>
<P>
But art institutions have become too beholden to the consumer mentality of the 
'80s. We need to be looking at significant works of art not as fine possessions 
purchased by x but as significant entities in their own right. The best and 
most memorable exhibits tend to be organized around a strong intellectual 
concept: a curator's notion of how a particular artist developed his or her 
style or how a body of art relates to the preoccupations of the society in 
which it was created. 
</P>
<P>
In a larger sense, museums and other art institutions are doing their job when 
they give viewers "what's good for them" rather than what they seem to want. 
Art is a specialized field -- as specialized as computer technology or 
arbitrage or microbiology. Rather than second-guess the interests of "average 
viewers," art institutions are in a position to introduce them to art they 
don't already know and love -- provided that the institutions' overseeing 
boards of directors or city departments don't stubbornly stand in their way. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, clarity and depth are the watchwords of first-class 
exhibition materials. Contemporary art is often based on difficult and unusual 
ideas. Older art is best understood in its historical context. Too often 
viewers of contemporary art are expected to wade through confusing texts 
bristling with unfamiliar terminology, and viewers of historical material are 
sent on their way with wishy-washy platitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Encouragingly, however, this year's exhibition schedule includes a quartet of 
particularly meaty approaches to art. 
</P>
<P>
At Newport Harbor Art Museum, "L.A. Pop in the Sixties" (April 23 to July 9) 
will reconsider Pop Art in Los Angeles -- as exemplified by the work of Ed 
Ruscha, Joe Goode, Billy Al Bengston, Wallace Berman, Vija Celmins, John 
Baldessari and others -- in light of the movement's conceptual underpinnings. 
To quote the museum's press materials, the exhibit will deal with "the 
relationship between visual 'sign' and written word, the conceptual 
manipulation of common objects and an extreme autobiographical bias" on the 
part of the artists. 
</P>
<P>
"American Landscape Video: The Electronic Grove," coming in the fall to Newport 
Harbor (organized by Carnegie Institute Museum of Art at Carnegie Mellon 
University in Pittsburg) will survey 20 years of video installations by Dara 
Birnbaum, Frank Gillette, Doug Hall, Mary Lucier, Bill Viola and others (Oct. 
20 to Dec. 31). Besides experiencing the sheer visual impact of works by major 
American video artists, viewers may look for curatorial insights into the way 
an age-old theme in art -- landscape -- has been transformed into a 
psychologically acute and technologically complex form. 
</P>
<P>
At the Laguna Art Museum, "David Park" (March 9 to May 17) will present 75 
works from the 1950s by the San Francisco Bay Area painter who abandoned 
abstraction to strike out on his own as a forceful realist. Organized by 
curator Richard Armstrong at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the show has 
been criticized because it analyzes Park's achievement in purely formalist 
terms even though the artist was deeply and chiefly interested in portraying 
lonely people in everyday settings. It will be interesting to see how the work 
holds up under such heavy-duty, if seemingly misguided, scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine's Fine Arts Gallery will offer a peek at the collecting habits of no 
less than Sigmund Freud, who fancied Egyptian bronzes, Greek and Roman terra 
cottas and various pieces of Asian art (Nov. 12 to Dec. 10). Unlike the usual 
run of "collector" shows, the collector is rightly paramount in this exhibit. 
What did art mean to the founder of psychoanalysis and why did he choose to 
live with particular works? That's what we will want to read about in the 
catalogue for the show, curated by Lynn Gamwell for the State University of New 
York at Binghamton. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the exhibition roster also includes three exhibits consisting 
primarily of drawings by artists known for ambitious, large-scale projects. 
Granted, such shows tend to be on the dry side visually, but if presented well 
they can impart valuable information about the way artistic ideas develop and 
mature. 
</P>
<P>
"Barry Le Va: 1968-1988," at Newport Harbor, will present 80 drawings (and, 
happily, six re-created installations) by the California artist (Jan. 20 to 
April 2). Le Va is famed for his "scatter pieces," made with eccentric 
materials that included flour, felt, bullets and paper towels strewn around 
defined spaces according to a particular logic of their own. The show was 
organized by Carnegie Mellon University Art Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"David Ireland: A Decade Documented 1978-1988" at UC Irvine (March 28 to April 
29) will introduce a Northern California artist whose unusual architectural 
environments are seldom seen in these parts with a group of drawings for 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Works by Helen and Newton Harrison," at the Laguna Art Museum (Jan. 20 to 
March 12), will consist of drawings and hand-colored photographic works for 
some of the couple's ecological projects. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of other exhibits will explore pockets of art activity of more than 
passing interest. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's exhibit of work by avant-garde Moscow painter Erik Bulatov 
will offer a glimpse of the way glasnost has affected the formerly 
monolithically Socialist Realist output of Soviet art (July 28 to Oct. 1). The 
museum has organized the exhibit in concert with the Renaissance Society of 
Chicago and the Albert and Vera List Visual Arts Center at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne Thiebaud: Works on Paper," due at UC Irvine (Oct. 8 to Nov. 4), is 
billed as the first major retrospective of prints, drawings, watercolors and 
paintings on paper by the Bay Area artist known best for his images of pies and 
cakes and hilly landscapes. Thiebaud is very popular with viewers. (The Newport 
Harbor show of the artist's paintings a couple of years ago was a smash hit.) 
But I hope that this show (organized by the Richard L. Nelson Gallery and the 
Fine Arts Collections at UC Davis) will provide a fresh outlook on his bright 
and seductive body of work. 
</P>
<P>
Another Bay Area artist is the focus of "Stephen De Staebler: The Figure," due 
at the Laguna Art Museum (June 2 to Sept. 10). The exhibit (curated by Lynn 
Gamwell for the museum and Saddleback College, where she was formerly director 
of the art gallery) will survey the sculptor's life-size works in clay and 
bronze. The monumental scale and fragmentary condition of these figures -- 
suggestive of archeological discoveries -- long ago gave De Staebler cult 
status in Northern California. In a larger context, his work always struck me 
as formulaic and redolent of little more than a sort of genteel, wistful 
humanism. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe this is the show that will change my mind. At the beginning of a new 
year, even curmudgeonly critics hold out bouquets of hope.

NAVY CHEFS TAKE SAVORY VOYAGE AT SAN DIEGO SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
COOKING: THE SERVICE IS OUT TO IMPROVE ITS CULINARY IMAGE BY TRAINING ITS BEST 
AND BRIGHTEST CHEFS AT A SCHOOL FOR ADVANCED COOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"No guts, no glory," said former Navy Master Chief Petty Officer Romeo Basmayor 
as he wielded a knife in front of 20 sailors. 
</P>
<P>
With surgical precision, he attacked a turnip, deftly carving it into a 
pristine white rose. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're out on a six-month deployment aboard a destroyer, don't just dump 
out all your parsley," Basmayor ordered. "Because you won't be getting any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
At the Navy's only advanced culinary school, 25 students hone specialized 
skills such as cake decorating, garnishing and ice carving. They are the Navy's 
best and brightest cooks, who earn the cumbersome title of mess management 
specialist. They can whip up beef stew for 300 or bake Virginia ham with 
pineapple raisin sauce for an admiral and visiting dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy vessel "is a big city that floats, so you need people with different 
specialties," said Lt. Ken Luchka, spokesman for the Naval Training Center, 
which hosts the advanced food preparation school as well as boot camp for 
thousands of sailors. 
</P>
<P>
For sailor-chefs, kitchens of the sea pose unique challenges. Mike Burkhart, 
19, had just made nine coconut cream pies when his submarine abruptly dove 
down, sending the pies flying. 
</P>
<P>
"We're supposed to get warned before they do that," said Burkhart, an Orrville, 
Ohio, native stationed aboard the submarine James Madison. 
</P>
<P>
Burkhart and others come to the school in San Diego because they love their 
trade, despite the aggravations. Most sailor-chefs acknowledge that Navy 
cuisine suffers an image problem and that crews usually call cooks "stewheads." 
</P>
<P>
"Cooks have a really bad reputation -- it's come with the years," said Colleen 
Larreau, a 28-year-old New Jersey resident who used to cook for Adm. William J. 
Crowe, the retired former chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff. "The Navy is 
trying to teach more pride and professionalism." 
</P>
<P>
Each year, about 300 sailors graduate from the advanced food preparation 
school. In groups of 25, they attend the three-week school that includes 
classes in Italian and French cooking, and teaches how to manage a kitchen 
aboard a sea-bound vessel for up to six months. When they cook, they must pay 
attention to nutrition, taste, cost, visual appeal, color scheme and morale. 
</P>
<P>
"If sailors start a day with a bad stomach, it's not only that you messed up a 
meal but you've possibly made a bad crew," said Lt. Cmdr. John Pemberton, 
director of supply schools at the training center. "You're concerned not only 
with the person eating, but morale. And the further you are from payday, the 
more you need to serve morale-boosting food." 
</P>
<P>
In the Navy, that means pizza, steak, ice cream, strawberry shortcake and, when 
possible, lobster. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the cooks, the reward is in the creation and appreciation of the 
meal. "It really gets me going when someone comes back and says, 'Great chow,' 
" said Walt Berrey, a 26-year-old Washington native who cooks aboard the 
submarine Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Others rein in their creative instincts to cater to the more traditional 
palates of crews. And they all, more or less, follow the prescribed recipes 
devised by the Armed Forces Recipe Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people in the Navy grew up with overcooked green beans. So I won't cook 
al dente," said Regis McDonald, 32, a Louisville, Ohio, native who enlisted 12 
years ago. "You try subtle changes -- you do a little at a time." 
</P>
<P>
For sailor-chefs, garnishing, ice carving and cake decorating are one of their 
few chances at culinary creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Burns, a 19-year-old Minnesota resident, gazes at an undecorated cake 
like an artist looking at an empty canvas. "I look at it and think of what I 
can do," said Burns, who adds that an award-winning cake takes about two hours 
to decorate. Burns won four first-place awards in Minneapolis contests 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Burns and others sometimes buck their families when they join the Navy and 
become cooks. "My family was shocked," said Burns, whose father had hoped he 
would follow in his footsteps and become a foreman in a utility plant. "I say 
that's just not me." 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of the school's graduates end up on vessels at sea. But most would 
rather be on shore and close to their hometown, Pemberton said. "We say, 'Join 
the Navy and see the world.' Most students don't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Only those at the top get to choose their assignments. Aside from short 
postings, duty aboard the newer vessels, like Aegis cruisers, are usually 
popular because of the more modern and spacious kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
The school is an effort to bolster the flagging image of Navy cuisine, dubbed 
"mess," by instilling more pride in cooks, officials say. Some, including 
cooks, say it's an uphill battle. But those at the school are confident that 
they will win. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, only the captains' food was garnished. When it comes to 
garnishing, if it looks good, I bet it tastes good," Basmayor said. "The 
majority of people eat with their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point in one recent class, Basmayor showed students how to make 
bachelor's button flowers out of radishes, a bird-shaped bowl from a pineapple 
and a banana, a rose bush from celery and turnips, and rosebuds from tomato 
peel. 
</P>
<P>
For major holidays or events such as change-of-command ceremonies, Basmayor 
suggests the chefs make ice sculptures from 3-foot-tall blocks of ice, which 
cost about $37. 
</P>
<P>
Using such niceties, officials say they hope to stem the attrition of sailors 
and boost morale aboard Navy vessels. But as a former Navy man, Basmayor 
recognizes that not all commanding officers will look favorably upon frills 
like garnishing. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you run into some who say, 'Don't garnish, it's a waste of time and 
money.' But I'd rather spend a little money on garnishing rather than just 
throwing the food down," he said. "Garnishing is what? It's imagination."

MAN STABBED DURING FIGHT OVER VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A newspaper delivery man making his rounds Monday stabbed a man who was trying 
to steal his van in the Pacific Beach area, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Robert McGee, a newspaper carrier for the San Diego Union, was 
delivering his papers about 6:35 a.m. in the 1300 block of Thomas Avenue and 
had momentarily left the van unattended with its engine running. 
</P>
<P>
As McGee, 47, returned to the van, a man climbed inside and began driving away, 
police said. McGee jumped in front of the van three times, finally forcing the 
van to roll to a stop, they said. 
</P>
<P>
A fight then broke out in the street, and McGee stabbed the man in the back 
with a knife, police said. Although it was unclear who owned the knife, police 
said McGee acted in self-defense during the fight. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man, Daniel Hernandez, 31, was listed in fair condition at Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. Police said he was booked on suspicion of auto 
theft.

INVESTIGATORS PROBE SCATTERED EXPLOSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least five explosions rocked scattered sites in San Diego early New Year's 
Day, breaking windows at a neighborhood market, scattering customers at a bar 
and destroying a residential mailbox, among other damage. 
</P>
<P>
One person suffered minor injuries in the blasts, the Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said it was not clear whether there was any link between the 
explosions, which varied considerably in intensity and occurred intermittently 
during an almost six-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
Police and Fire Department arson experts were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
At least five explosions were confirmed, but authorities said there may have 
been additional blasts. Information on some of the incidents was still sketchy 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The first explosion occurred at 12:49 a.m. at the Lancer's cocktail lounge on 
Park Boulevard in North Park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
According to an employee, someone tossed an explosive device through the side 
door of the bar, stunning the 60 or so New Year's revelers present. No one was 
injured, said the employee, who added that it took 20 minutes for the smoke to 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
At 1:12 a.m., Fire Capt. William Middleton said, a pipe bomb exploded in the 
3200 block of Myrtle Avenue in the City Heights section. The powerful blast 
blew the glass out of doors and windows at the Park Villa Market. 
</P>
<P>
At 3:38 a.m., Middleton said, explosives destroyed a mailbox in the 1000 block 
of 30th Street, scattering mail on the street. U.S. Postal Service officials 
were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 6 a.m., a device -- evidently a large firecracker -- was set off 
near a downtown bench on C Street where a man was apparently sleeping. The man 
received minor injuries, Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police also reported a loud explosion at 1:04 a.m. in the 4000 block 
of Alabama Street in North Park, but no other details were available.

MAN FOUND SHOT TO DEATH IN SANTEE GARAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man was found shot to death Monday in a garage in Santee, and 
San Diego County Sheriff's Department investigators were questioning three 
residents at the house. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Kim Carson said deputies were called to the home in the 10100 block of 
Magnolia Avenue about 7 a.m. by one of the residents, who dialed 911 and 
reported a shooting at that location. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies found a dead man in the garage, apparently the victim of a gunshot. 
His identity was not released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said three occupants of the house were removed for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
"It is believed one of the occupants may have fired the weapon, but the 
circumstances around the shooting are not yet known," Carson said.

SALVADORAN WITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times editorial on Dec. 15 ("Will Peace Be Given A Chance?") suggested that 
if two fundamentally important points agreed to at the Central American 
Presidents summit were honored, "this could go a long way toward ending the 
civil war in El Salvador and the Contra war in Nicaragua." The two points are: 
(1) that he FMLN rebels resume negotiations with Salvadoran President 
Cristiani, and (2) that the U.S. stop supporting the Contras and instead devote 
its aid to disbanding them. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Salvadoran war, however, resumption of negotiations would 
only put the parties back on square one, where they were before the rebel 
military offensive started last month. In the negotiations taking place shortly 
before the offensive began, the Salvadoran government negotiators refused to 
accept any proposals for changes oriented toward democratization, economic 
reform, greater social justice, or an end to repression. Instead the government 
launched a series of attacks against churches, peace and human rights groups, 
labor unions, the university, and other elements of the popular movement. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the tiny, wealthy Salvadoran oligarchy and the military refuse to 
change the grossly unequal, unjust socioeconomic system and refuse to end the 
barbaric repression with which they maintain the system, the Salvadoran civil 
war will continue. And as long as the U.S. continues to send massive amounts of 
economic and military aid to maintain the Salvadoran system, the oligarchy and 
the military will cling to their wealth and power and refuse to make 
concessions or to permit reforms.

WEARING FUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wear fur and I wear it proudly. As an American, I have the right whether to 
wear fur, or leather shoes, or eat chicken. 
</P>
<P>
I'm tired of the shock-wave media and propaganda of animal activists. And I'm 
horrified that they will destroy property ("Animal Activists Blamed in Wide 
Ranch Sabotage," Nov. 19) to get their message across. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I found out exactly how the fur industry operates, its role in the 
conservation of our natural habitats and species, and no difference in the 
raising of fur or chicken, and the trapping of animals to prevent 
overpopulation and spread of disease. I am educated, I care about ecology, I 
care about the survival of our planet, and in having a choice, I'm wearing my 
decision.

SPECTER OF FAMINE IN ETHIOPIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A famine as grave as that of 1985 is threatening 5 million Ethiopians, 
prompting a global appeal for help from United Nations Secretary General Javier 
Perez de Cuellar. There has been a quick response from the United States and 
the European Community, but the effectiveness of the relief mission is clouded 
by civil strife in that country and restrictions imposed by the Ethiopian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Food supplies in the northern provinces will be exhausted in the first months 
of the new year, according to an assessment by the U.N. Food and Agriculture 
Organization. The impact of the drought has been made worse by the continuing 
warfare being waged between government forces and guerrilla organizations in 
both Tigre, where the drought is worst, and Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian officials have approved a flow of aid to rebel-controlled territory 
but only through the Joint Relief Program, a consortium of Ethiopian relief 
groups. This will facilitate the flow of American aid which is sent through 
Catholic Relief Services, an agency working closely with the joint program. But 
thus far the Ethiopian government has not approved the flow of aid from the 
International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations into the northern 
provinces where the civil warfare is raging. 
</P>
<P>
The initial American commitment of 165,000 metric tons of grains is about 
one-fifth of the estimated total food aid needed for 1990. In addition, the 
United States is providing food assistance to three other African food crisis 
areas, Sudan, Mozambique and Angola, all three caught in devastating civil 
strife. 
</P>
<P>
Deterioration of the food situation in Ethiopia comes at a time when developing 
nations throughout the world are falling behind in food production. This year, 
cereal production in the nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America increased 
only 1%, substantially less than population growth.

PLUGGING THE DROPOUT HOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All junior high school students face the universal adolescent anxiety of 
fitting in. In the Southland, many also face problems like persistent poverty, 
abuse, a new language, a new step-parent or their own new baby. No wonder so 
many drop out. 
</P>
<P>
The junior high dropout rate was 7.4% in the Los Angeles public schools last 
year with more than 8,000 students calling it quits because of sex, drugs, 
alcohol, crime or because they were illiterate and bored. 
</P>
<P>
Those dropouts needed help, but not enough was available. What is available 
reaches only a lucky few. The state spends more than $12 million to keep 
high-risk students in school, primarily in urban school districts like Los 
Angeles and Santa Ana in Orange County, but that is only enough money to reach 
hundreds of students when the need is in the tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District supplements state funding of nearly $1 
million per year with an additional $400,000, enough to help an average of only 
100 students on 32 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Motivating students who are at risk is expensive but worthwhile. The schools 
involved in the state dropout effort have been effective in reducing dropout 
rates, increasing attendance and improving academic achievement, according to a 
preliminary evaluation completed last week. 
</P>
<P>
Helping more youngsters on the verge of dropping out is just one aspect of the 
problem. More must be done at the start of the education process to keep 
students from reaching that point. Early efforts must be made to help 
youngsters form good habits. Take something as simple as paying closer 
attention to a student's attendance record. Perfect attendance is hard to 
achieve. Only one pupil out of four in the kindergarten classes at Garvanza 
Elementary School in Highland Park came close in any given month last year. The 
poor showing prompted the dropout prevention counselor to bring a thermometer 
to school and teach kindergarten pupils to stay home only when they are sick, 
not when they want to go shopping with a parent. Attendance improved. Nearly 
one-third attended school every day last month. Such early intervention is 
essential because problems that start in elementary school can exacerbate in 
junior high. 
</P>
<P>
To overcome another problem -- the switch from the small pond of elementary 
school to the ocean of junior high campuses -- El Sereno Junior High in 
northeast Los Angeles has grouped together 97 seventh-graders to form what is 
in effect a school within a school. Within the comfortable confines of the 
small group, the students get to know their teachers and classmates; their 
teachers get to know them. After one year, the close-knit group tends to have 
slightly better grades and a better outlook about school, solid antidotes to 
the temptation to drop out. 
</P>
<P>
El Sereno and other schools with dropout programs can refer failing youngsters 
to a student study team. The team, which includes parents, counselors and 
teachers, tries to correct mistakes without blaming the child. No meeting 
begins with a scolding. Each session begins with a look at a potential 
dropout's strengths, which are not always obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Junior high students often need close attention simply because they are at a 
difficult stage. They rarely get it. Special dropout programs are providing 
that attention for students at a few schools in Los Angeles. An expanded state 
dropout program would give even more youngsters a chance, a goal that Gov. 
George Deukmejian and the Legislature should put high on their agendas for 
1990.

IF THE COLLAPSE OF MARRIAGE IS NOBODY'S 'FAULT,' WHY DO WOMEN PAY?; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: TWENTY YEARS AGO, CALIFORNIA MOVED TO MAKE DIVORCE RATIONAL, EVEN 
CIVILIZED. ENTER THE HORROR STORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the very end of "The War of the Roses," Danny de Vito delivers the moral to 
his cautionary tale about the mutually assured destruction of a marriage. 
"Civilized divorce," he concludes, "is a contradiction in terms." 
</P>
<P>
This is more than a punch line to the movie. It may serve as the footnote to 
that product of wishful thinking and right-minded reform that marks its 20th 
anniversary this week: no-fault divorce. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1970, the state of California put into effect a kind of peace 
treaty. No-fault divorce was to end the use of the courtroom as a battleground 
between divorcing parties. 
</P>
<P>
Until that moment, divorce in America was for the most part awarded only after 
one party was proved to be guilty for ending the marriage. This was a messy and 
often deceitful process to prove that one person was at fault, guilty of 
adultery or cruelty, and that there were "grounds" for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
In a legislative sweep of the hand, California eliminated fault as the grounds 
for divorce, or for awarding alimony, or for dividing property, which was to be 
split equally. The law, signed by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, was hailed as the 
first step to making divorce rational, equitable, modern, quick and, yes, 
civilized. 
</P>
<P>
Where California led, the country followed. In relatively rapid order, no-fault 
divorce became common in every state. And so, too, more slowly, did the horror 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Wallerstein, the author of "Second Chances," says now from the vantage 
point of two decades, "How little we anticipated what the results might be. We 
passed legislation without a sufficient attempt to foresee the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
What were the consequences? No-fault divorce did make the legal process less 
scandalous. But the new law and the loss of the old bargaining chip, fault, 
contributed to an economic disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Lenore Weitzman's seminal book, "The Divorce Revolution," was the first to 
document the real-life effect of the law in California. "No fault was taken to 
mean no responsibility," says Weitzman, now a sociology professor at Harvard. 
The results were "a systematic impoverishment of women and children." 
</P>
<P>
In the early flush of feminism, the law presumed and the judges rigorously, 
even ruthlessly, implemented the idea that women should be able to support 
themselves, even if they'd been out of the work force for years. The strict 
equal treatment of economic unequals was financially disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
Alimony or spousal support diminished in amount and length. Ordered to divide 
property equally, couples had to sell homes, taking children away from their 
old neighborhoods and schools. There was no allowance made for the one real 
economic asset of a modern marriage: present and future earning power. 
</P>
<P>
"No-fault was the vehicle or the excuse for saying that what happened in the 
past didn't matter, what matters is that you divide up the property and each go 
your own way, "says Weitzman. " Judges used it to cut women off." 
</P>
<P>
To this day, economists argue about how much no-fault divorce added to the 
plight of women and children. But they all agree it was a factor. Today, 
nationally, five years after divorce, a woman's income is still 30% of what it 
was during the marriage. A man's income is 14% more. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is a movement to reform the reform. The movement says that no fault 
is not the same as no responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Once again California has been among the first to experiment. It has, among 
other things, revised the standards for spousal support and the duration of 
that support. Equally important, it is changing judicial attitudes about 
property division that forced the sale of children's homes. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, the second wave is pointed not only at a more viable 
spousal support, but also at enforcing child-support decrees. There is heated 
discussion as well about whether business assets and professional credentials 
should be considered "marital property" upon divorce. 
</P>
<P>
But this reform wave, like the last one, takes place in a larger context. Today 
most families need two incomes. When one family becomes two single households, 
there is rarely enough. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, for all the rhetoric and real change, most women still enter marriage 
earning less. They often go on earning less throughout marriage and especially 
motherhood. And so they leave a marriage earning less. 
</P>
<P>
There are limits to how much any divorce law can make up for the inequities of 
a whole society. The old reforms continued and even exaggerated those 
inequities. All these reforms can try to do, as Weitzman puts it, is to see at 
least that husband and wife "both share the burdens of divorce in America." 
</P>
<P>
So a truce signed 20 years ago with high ideals about marital peace and 
domestic justice and gender equality has come up against economic reality and 
more than a touch of emotional cynicism. It just may be that a civilized 
divorce law is also a contradiction in terms.

JUSTICE FOR NORIEGA ISN'T IN THE CARDS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: OLLIE NORTH'S CLOAK OF DISPENSATIONS WOULD FIT THE GENERAL JUST AS WELL. 
THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T AFFORD TO TRY HIM -- OR TO LET HIM FREE.

<P>
The one country we can be certain Manuel Noriega will not ask to be sent to is 
Romania. The new revolutionary government's concept of justice -- secret 
"trial," no appeal, quick execution -- is unlikely to appeal to Noriega's sense 
of survival. 
</P>
<P>
Like many tyrants of the past, Noriega will be seeking a peaceful and luxurious 
retirement. And if history is a guide to the future, he will find some fellow 
dictator willing to extend him a professional courtesy. Among the modern 
precedents is the hospitality extended to mass murderer Idi Amin by Saudi 
Arabia, and the welcome mat rolled out for Nazi war criminals by Paraguay and 
Syria. Even civilized countries like the United States and France have given 
sanctuary to despots -- like the Shah of Iran, Ferdinand Marcos and Jean-Claude 
"Baby Doc" Duvalier, wanted for trial in their own countries. 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources, pointing to Noriega's indictment on drug charges, have 
tried to distinguish the case by arguing that he is "a common criminal." But 
the Shah, Marcos and Duvalier were also regarded as criminals by their own 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that we sent in the U.S. Army to capture Noriega weakens our claim 
that he is a "common criminal" as distinguished from a political opponent. He 
may well be both. The U.S. government certainly did not regard him as a common 
criminal when our CIA worked hand-in-hand with him over a considerable number 
of years. We treated him as the powerful political figure he was. He may have 
been an s.o.b., but as Franklin Roosevelt once said of another U.S.-supported 
Central American dictator: "At least he's our s.o.b." 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Noriega is no longer our s.o.b., but he apparently knows a lot about 
other s.o.b.'s with whom we are, and have been, dealing. He also knows about 
our CIA operations throughout Central and South America. It is for this reason 
that knowledgeable sources are doubting that President Bush really wants him to 
be tried in an American court. Under the rules of evidence, Noriega's lawyers 
could demand disclosure of highly embarrassing government files. If our 
intelligence services refuse to produce those files, the charges against 
Noriega might have to be dropped, as several charges were dropped against 
Oliver North, John Poindexter and others. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is that the Bush Administration and the Central Intelligence 
Agency wanted the charges dropped against North and Poindexter. They used the 
cloak of national security as an excuse for helping their friends. Noriega is 
nobody's friend. The last thing the Administration wants now is a trial in an 
American court that results in a dismissal of charges against him. Our legal 
system is based on precedents. The crowning irony would be for the precedent 
established in the case of hero Ollie North to be used to free villain Manuel 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
There were many officials in Washington who were hoping that Noriega would 
suffer the fate of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator executed by his own 
army, or of Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the Medellin drug boss killed in a 
shootout. 
</P>
<P>
Short of Noriega being killed, the next best outcome for the Administration may 
well be the one that is currently playing itself out. The problem is now 
squarely in the hands of the Vatican. No one expects us to use gunboat 
diplomacy on the nunciature. Our hands are tied. We did the best we could. Or 
did we? Is it possible that Noriega's all-too-obvious Vatican option did not 
occur to a single Washington official? Could we not have surrounded the 
nunciature to prevent Noriega from sneaking in? Or did we really close our eyes 
to this possibility? 
</P>
<P>
It's not too late to get our hands on the fugitive who has continued to make a 
fool of us. We can simply wait him out. Although international law may forbid 
us from physically entering the nunciature and grabbing Noriega, he remains 
subject to capture as soon as he tries to leave. Cars, helicopters and 
airplanes -- even those bearing the seal of the Vatican -- are not the 
"territory" of the Vatican as the nunciature is. If the Vatican were to decide 
to allow Noriega to seek asylum in Cuba or some other country, we need not 
allow him safe passage. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that not so long ago, we forcibly stopped an Egyptian aircraft 
carrying terrorists and made it land in Italy, where the terrorists were 
apprehended. We could do the same with Noriega. But there are many who believe 
that we will not do everything in our legal, diplomatic and military power to 
see to it that Noriega is brought to trial in a America. courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
As a Noriega lawyer put it to me: "They know that the case of the United States 
vs. Manuel Noriega would really turn out to be the case of Manuel Noriega vs. 
the CIA, Ronald Reagan and George Bush."

MISSING GIRL SPOTTED AT A THIRD REST STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The search for Leticia Hernandez was given new promise Monday when a witness 
reported seeing the 7-year-old Oceanside girl with a man and woman at a highway 
rest stop near El Paso, Tex., police said. 
</P>
<P>
The report brings to three the number of sightings of the girl, who has been 
missing since Dec. 16 from her home in the 1300 block of Bush Street. "It 
really gives us new hope," said Mary Jane Midstokk, an Oceanside police 
officer. "It's a positive sign." 
</P>
<P>
A child matching Leticia's description was first spotted at a Buckman Springs 
rest stop on Interstate 8 in east San Diego County on the day of her 
disappearance, but the witness did not report the sighting until five days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
A second sighting occurred Wednesday morning and was reported within 24 hours. 
In that incident, several witnesses reported seeing a girl resembling Leticia 
at the San Simon rest stop on Interstate 10 in Arizona, just west of New 
Mexico. The girl was seen with a man and a woman, and witnesses said she 
appeared distraught, scared and intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest sighting, which occurred about 4:30 a.m. Friday, the girl was 
seen at a third rest stop, this one east of El Paso on Interstate 10. A witness 
told authorities Monday that he saw the girl leave the ladies bathroom and 
return to an older car. A man was in the car, but police said the witness did 
not get a good description of him. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the woman accompanying the girl was described as a white female, 
mid-30s, 5 feet, 10 inches tall, about 130 pounds, with dirty blond 
collar-length hair. The car was described as a dirty maroon midsize sedan, 
possibly a 1975 or 1976 model. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in the female restroom, they were out of the car and using the 
facilities." said Sgt. Bill Krunglevich of the Oceanside Police. "The 
indication we have is that the girl seemed to be OK and in the company of the 
female." 
</P>
<P>
The woman, the girl and the vehicle match descriptions given in the San Simon 
sighting, police said. Police also noted that the couple is moving the girl 
eastward to an undetermined location. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to be a continuation of the same sightings, with one male and one 
female and the vehicle, along with the young girl, in an easterly direction on 
the interstate," Krunglevich said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that a photograph of Leticia and a composite drawing of the woman had 
been shown on west Texas television stations Thursday night, and that the El 
Paso witness apparently saw the pictures on TV before the sighting. 
</P>
<P>
Police are attempting to get more public service announcements on television 
stations in Houston and Dallas, as well as stations in Louisiana and Arkansas, 
on the belief that the couple will continue eastward. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still pushing with the media," Krunglevich said. "We're still working 
with the FBI. And now we're working hard in the state of Texas." 
</P>
<P>
He hopes police can catch up with the little girl. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems they're heading east on an extremely slow pace," he said. "They're 
moving very slow, always on the interstate, always pulling off at interstate 
rest stops." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about the case should call Oceanside Police at 
966-4911.

Coastal and inland winds may reach 25 m.p.h. tonight, and up to 30 m.p.h. in 
the mountain areas. Mountains in San Diego County should receive anywhere from 
6 inches to 1 foot of snow today at the 5,000-feet level. 
</P>
<P>
The showers and cloudiness will decrease tonight and early Wednesday morning, 
when the storm system heads east. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the temperatures will remain cool, with the coastal and inland areas 
experiencing highs ranging 57 to 63 degrees, dropping overnight to 46 to 51 on 
the coast and to 38 to 46 inland. 
</P>
<P>
Daytime temperatures in the mountains will range 36 to 44 and fall to 26 to 34 
degrees at night. The deserts will reach 58 to 66 degrees today and have 
overnight lows of 38 to 46. 
</P>
<P>
The surf is 3 to 6 feet at 13 second intervals, with occasional breakers as 
high as 8 feet. The water temperature is a brisk 59 degrees.

Sajak Buys W-E-D: The host of "Wheel of Fortune" and CBS's late-night talk show 
has a new role: husband. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Sajak, 42, married Lesly Brown, 24, in a private service late on New Year's 
Eve in Annapolis, Md. The Baltimore Sun reports the newlyweds ducked in a side 
door of St. Mary's Catholic Church to avoid about two dozen onlookers, and -- 
after a service featuring a 25-piece orchestra -- left with similar stealth. 
Sajak fans waiting in the rain outside the church were mollified, however, by a 
glimpse of Vanna White, Sajak's "Wheel of Fortune" co-star. Claudia Puig

After-Christmas Present: The La Jolla Playhouse is facing a cheerier new year, 
thanks to a $400,000 gift from the Joan B. Kroc Foundation. Kroc is the widow 
of Ray Kroc, founder of McDonald's. The grant, which enabled the Playhouse to 
balance its 1989 operations budget, is separate from the theater's current 
financial stabilization campaign, which is lobbying to raise $1 million by June 
30. Claudia Puig

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC; 
</P>
<P>
OPERA, SYMPHONY CHIEFS HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1990s, San Diego's classical music institutions hope to atone for the 
sins of the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
At Symphony Hall, incoming music director Yoav Talmi will undertake the musical 
reconstruction of an orchestra that has been without a music director for three 
years, while executive director Wesley Brustad and board members look for a 
generous donor whose "naming gift" will absorb half of the lingering $4-million 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Campbell, having put San Diego Opera's house in fiscal order, is more 
concerned with righting the sins of omission (mainly in programming) over the 
last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Our immediate challenge is to include 20th-Century repertory in our seasons as 
a matter of course," said Campbell, the opera's general director. "Not that the 
company hasn't done this repertory in the past, but we've had no regular diet 
to allow our audiences to grow into newer operas. As we enter the last decade 
of the century, we need to do a gentle catch-up." 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Campbell promising 20th-Century opera in every season -- and he 
insisted that he means operas more adventuresome than late Puccini and Richard 
Strauss -- he intends to restore American opera to the company's offerings at 
least every other year. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have two 20th-Century operas in 1991, including (American composer) 
Carlisle Floyd's 'The Passion of Jonathan Wade,' with Floyd directing the 
production." Less well-known than Floyd's other operas -- "Susannah" and "Of 
Mice and Men" are his calling cards -- "The Passion of Jonathan Wade" is echt 
Americana, set in South Carolina immediately after the Civil War. Commissioned 
by New York City Opera, the opera was first performed in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a cautious expansion of the company's season at Civic Theatre, 
Campbell sees a five-opera season for the first half of the 1990s and a 
six-opera season by the second half of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the market place more complex in the 1990s, and we have to be practical 
about expanding," Campbell explained. He noted, however, that the success of 
"Cats," "Les Miserables," and "Phantom of the Opera" on the popular 
contemporary music stage could be beneficial for traditional opera. 
</P>
<P>
"These shows are actually opera in their form, because they are sung all the 
way through with little or no dialogue. They could act as a bridge for people 
who have previously avoided opera and encourage them to try something like 
"Madama Butterfly." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, recently returned from a European scouting mission, had no news to 
report about up-and-coming tenor superstars to add to the performances. He did, 
however, manage to sign the promising young German baritone Hans Peter 
Blochwitz to sing a recital here in October, 1990, which will mark his American 
recital debut. 
</P>
<P>
Other singers Campbell promises in San Diego Opera productions during the 1990s 
include familiar names such as Carol Vaness, Hakan Hagegard, Ashley Putnam and 
Diana Soviero. Among the younger singers, he has signed American tenors Richard 
Leech and Gary Lakes, as well as baritone Thomas Hampson. 
</P>
<P>
"In the coming decade, we will be hiring fewer foreign singers in major roles 
because a new crop of American singers is just now coming into its own." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell also indicated that his company might dabble in the Gilbert and 
Sullivan repertory or include an occasional classic American musical in its 
lineup, although not without first talking with local companies who specialize 
in these areas to ensure that the opera company will undertake complementary 
offerings. He is also keeping his eye on the vacant -- and currently unrestored 
-- Balboa Theater as a potential venue for chamber opera, an alternative season 
geared to appeal to a new audience. 
</P>
<P>
When Campbell pulls out his wish list, the Australian native dreams of a 
dramatic new opera complex on the San Diego harbor, much like the 
architecturally stunning opera house in Sydney. Although with a probable price 
tag of $150 million, Campbell's company is not about to undertake a building 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
For the decade's close, Campbell envisions the company commissioning an opera 
to herald the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"For a new century, we need to premiere a new opera. San Diego Opera hasn't 
commissioned an opera since Menotti's 'La Loca' (1979). We need to do it as a 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
For the San Diego Symphony, Brustad has concrete plans for the next three to 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, the orchestra will be recording for first time ever on a major 
label. When we start seeing the records in stores, it won't be a big money 
thing, but it will be a significant achievement for the musicians," Brustad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, Yoav (Talmi) and I are committed to the touring of the orchestra, 
not because we think that we are the Philadelphia Orchestra, but for the 
artistic development of the orchestra's ensemble by playing in other venues in 
different cities. Touring also brings back good will here to the city. If 
people here in town read in an out-of-town newspaper, 'These guys played like 
angels,' then they're more than just the hometown boys." 
</P>
<P>
Concerning changes in the orchestra's programming, the ball is now in Talmi's 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a wide repertory," Brustad noted, "but I'm curious to see how it will 
play in the first couple of years. It's different to talk about varied 
programming and then get into the music director's chair, where you're the one 
who's going to be shot at. You tend to tighten up a little bit. It will be 
interesting for me to see how he maneuvers his way through. I know that he does 
not want to isolate contemporary music into a single series by itself, 
however." 
</P>
<P>
Brustad's biggest hope for the decade is to move from Hospitality Point on 
Mission Bay into a new home for the symphony's summer concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've got out there is cute and nice, but it's a little temporary. After 
eight years, we need something more substantial, a larger, permanent venue on 
the water that will allow us to move toward more of a Hollywood Bowl venue and 
program." 
</P>
<P>
According to Brustad, he is not simply empire building. This type of summer 
facility with income-producing events augmenting the pops programs is essential 
for the orchestra's future economic stability. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see this town supporting its orchestra like they do in Boston. It's 
simple as the weather. It's just too nice to live here, which is why the summer 
pops works so beautifully -- it's outdoors. You don't fight the weather; you're 
part of it."

CULT: PAINFUL SINCERITY AMID THE RIFFS

After opening with the "one day a rain's gonna come and wash all the scum off 
the streets" rap popularized by a certain former taxi driver, the Cult 
kerranng! in the New Year before a capacity crowd at the Long Beach Arena. 
Balloons cascaded from the ceiling as the Cult tossed off a 
learned-it-at-soundcheck version of "Auld Lang Syne" that was distinguishable 
from the rest of the set by virtue of its once having had a memorable melody. 
</P>
<P>
Cheap joke. After all, the British hard-rock quartet has at least 30 minutes of 
solid material, as demonstrated throughout the course of its 90-minute set. 
</P>
<P>
Having devolved from gloom-doom boomers to college radio faves for the usual 
three days to the ele-metal rock band with two gold LPs, these big-noise boys 
can now truck around a big-time stage set-up, complete with a light truss that 
rotates at big moments to reveal a big red Maltese cross, but they really don't 
need the spectacle. The energy they expend running around striking poses alone 
could've lit up the whole city of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, guitarist Billy Duffy played nothin' but racket. Bassist Jamie 
Stewart -- another minimalist -- and this year's tour drummer were as tight as 
the space between the blocks of the pyramids and about as solid, and vocalist 
Ian Astbury carried on as if he were Jim Morrison's baby brother, the 
Salamander Prince himself. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of rock offspring, Bonham -- the British quartet led by drummer Jason 
Bonham, son o' late Led Zeppelin drummer John -- preceded the Cult with a 
50-minute set that sounded alternately like his father and Foreigner-type radio 
fodder (the hit "Wait for You"). These Led Clones might have a (birth)right to 
the sound, but the shameless "my dad was blah-blah-blah and I'm gonna do this 
one for him" rap before the rendition of the Zep's magnificent "Black Dog" 
(lowlighted by the guitarist's leaving about half the solo's notes in the 
dressing room) must've had dad rockin' -- but mostly rollin' over -- in his 
grave. That is, if the rip-off of "Kashmir" hadn't already flipped pop's top. 
</P>
<P>
The Cult, of course, has its own rip-off of "Kashmir." Laying on the '60s 
imagery with a hod full of soul, it's also got a song about deceased Warhol 
scenemaker Edie Sedgwick, written as a cautionary drug tale. It's that crazy 
combination of flagrant riff-lifting and painful sincerity that makes the Cult 
the closest thing pop music has to the Troggs nowadays. Can't wait for the 
bootlegs of the studio bickering to surface. DON WALLER

Matisse Works Stolen: A cat burglar stole eight works by French master Henri 
Matisse worth $12.5 million from the artist's former apartment in Nice, police 
said Monday. The works include the celebrated oil paintings "View Over the Port 
of Collioure," "Woman in Brittany" and "Devilacqua." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the plush apartment located in the hills overlooking the 
Mediterranean was Matisse's home from 1938 until his death in 1954, but it had 
not been lived in regularly for more than 20 years. According to police 
sources, the apartment and paintings were bequeathed jointly to Matisse's 
heirs, who had been unable to agree on how the legacy should be divided. The 
painter's daughter-in-law, Maria Matisse, discovered the theft. The thief 
climbed up the front of the building, broke a window to get into the 
third-floor apartment and cut five oils, two pencil drawings and an etching 
from their frames, police said. The collection of works kept at the apartment 
are well known and police said it would be difficult for the thieves to sell 
them on the legitimate art market. Claudia Puig

68 ARRESTED, 8 HURT IN NEW YEAR'S GUNFIRE;

SHOOTINGS: POLICE SAY A PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGN DID CUT DOWN ON THE 
SOMETIMES DEADLY TRADITION. BUT SHOTS STILL RANG OUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY.

<P>
Betty Green could scarcely believe her eyes and ears when she drove onto her 
street just after midnight Monday on her way home from a church meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of men and women, Green's neighbors, were standing in the street, 
shooting into the air and taking potshots at street lights, even blasting the 
limbs off magnolia trees lining West 53rd Street in South Los Angeles. Some of 
the revelers burned Christmas trees in the fog-shrouded road. 
</P>
<P>
Green, 60, said she sat quaking in her parked car for 10 minutes, then sprinted 
into her house. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guns went boom so loud the whole house vibrated," Green recalled a few 
hours later. "I said, 'This is too much.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was a scene played out -- albeit to a lesser degree, in most cases -- in 
many parts of the county, as once again New Year's in Los Angeles produced 
outbursts of random gunfire that could be heard from Watts to Beverly Hills. 
Celebrants, many of them tipsy, shot wildly skyward, into the ground and, 
occasionally, at each other. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement campaigns to end the sometimes deadly tradition, coupled with 
threats of felony prosecution, apparently did curb the gunfire somewhat Sunday 
night and Monday morning and led to more arrests. Los Angeles police arrested 
37 people on felony charges of discharging weapons in a reckless manner. The 
Sheriff's Department arrested 31. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, at least eight people were injured in the gunfire, two by Los 
Angeles police officers who say the celebrants, taken by surprise, fired on 
them with a shotgun. Scores of weapons were confiscated throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
To curb the gunfire this year, LAPD Deputy Chief William Rathburn said, the 
department devised a plan that included the deployment of hundreds of officers 
in cars and on foot, especially in South Los Angeles and the Rampart and 
Hollenbeck divisions, where police say most of the shooting occurs. 
</P>
<P>
During December, flyers discouraging New Year's Eve shooting were distributed 
to schoolchildren and posted in businesses all over the city. The flyers 
included a telephone hot line that residents could use to identify shooters to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
All through the day on New Year's Eve, unprecedented numbers of officers were 
deployed in two of the city's largest housing projects, Nickerson Gardens and 
Jordan Downs, and in nearby Imperial Courts. The amount of shooting in all 
three, particularly in the early evening, was significantly lower than last 
year, most officers interviewed said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said some of the heaviest gunfire this year occurred in the southeast 
corner of the city. Heavy gunfire was also reported in the Wilshire area and in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"From everything we can see," the police media campaign "was largely 
successful," Police Department spokesman Bill Frio said. "What we'd like is to 
have nobody shooting in the air. But it may take years before we can get 
everybody to stop." As midnight approached, citizens -- and even police 
officers -- sought refuge from the falling lead by staying indoors or parking 
their vehicles in isolated areas and under freeway overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
Bennie Townsend, 40, of Compton sat with a friend inside a car parked behind 
his newly painted blue Mack truck, beneath an overpass on Central Avenue in 
Watts at 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Last New Year's Eve, Townsend said, the truck was hit near the engine and 
suffered $600 worth of damage. "I can't see any bullets going through it again 
-- not this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, in a truck terminal, officers sat in two cars that had been 
parked close to huge trailers. During the worst of the barrage, bullets could 
be heard zinging against the trailers and crashing through trees. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's good-natured celebrating," mused Capt. Stephen Gates of 
the Southeast Division as someone repeatedly fired a semiautomatic weapon 
nearby. Seconds later, a bullet kicked up gravel a few feet away from the cars. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of deaths anywhere in Los Angeles County. In the city of 
Los Angeles, there were no reports of injuries from errant bullets. One of the 
men shot by police, Thedeus Jenkins, 18, was hit in the buttocks with shotgun 
pellets. His companion, a 16-year-old whose name was not released, was hit by 
pellets in the face. Both were held on suspicion of assaulting a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The six injuries in areas under the sheriff's jurisdiction included a 
3-year-old girl who was hit in the leg as her father held her in his arms in 
the Florence area, and a pregnant woman who was grazed in the back as she was 
tending a back yard barbecue in the Willowbrook area. A Bellflower man was hit 
in the thigh and ankle by ricocheting bullets his neighbor had fired into the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the arrests in the city occurred Monday morning after citizens called 
police and reported that their neighbors had been shooting. Police and deputy 
district attorneys had set up a command post to prepare arrest warrants and 
process those hauled in. 
</P>
<P>
On one street in South-Central Los Angeles on Monday morning, children ran 
through the block filling their pockets with spent shotgun and rifle shells. 
Nearby, a 19-year-old man who spoke on condition his name not be used boasted 
that he had fired a M-1 rifle and a .38-caliber pistol into the air and at 
street lights. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're not shooting a gun on New Year's Eve, you shouldn't be outside," 
said the young man, standing beside a mound of spent shells and wine bottles 
swept up by neighbors. "Shooting up in the air? There's nobody up there. 
Besides, by the time the bullets get up there, they're not going to hurt 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing could be further from the truth, say police officers, pointing out that 
what goes up must come down. At least five people in recent years have been 
killed by bullets that hit them on their way to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Officers say a bullet fired into the air can travel more than a mile and fall 
to the ground at nearly the same velocity it left the muzzle. That is more than 
enough speed to pierce a body, even a roof. 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD's Gates said that traditionally, the shooting is done by normally 
law-abiding people who have been drinking alcohol.

VIOLATORS TAKE NOTICE OF BILLS FOR REMOVING POSTERS; 
</P>
<P>
ADVERTISING: 528 RESIDENTS WERE ASSESSED CHARGES FOR REMOVING THEIR NAILED AND 
THUMBTACKED SIGNS FROM PUBLIC PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a warm afternoon last October, Woodland Hills resident Richard Linder 
carefully printed "House for Rent" on six pieces of 8 1/2-by-11-inch paper, 
stuffed a box of thumbtacks in his pocket and drove around Van Nuys pinning the 
sheets on telephone poles. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a stunned Linder discovered that the mundane task would cost him 
$194.20. "Your signs have been illegally posted," stated a city letter that 
ordered the 63-year-old contractor to pay a high price for creating "blighted 
conditions" in his community. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked. I'm just a little guy trying to rent a house," Linder said. "I 
freely admit I hung the signs. But this seems like a severe penalty for tacking 
a sign on a pole." 
</P>
<P>
Linder is among 528 Los Angeles lawbreakers, who have received the first batch 
of costly bills from the Los Angeles Department of Public Works as part of an 
aggressive new law enforcement program in which city crews are tearing away 
illegally posted signs and billing offenders for the removal service. 
</P>
<P>
The days of stapling, nailing and taping "Garage Sale," "For Sale" and even 
"Lost Dog" signs on telephone and street light poles are over, said public 
works officials. The city aims to slap heavy fees on lawbreakers -- homeowners, 
big developers and entrepreneurs alike -- to deter them from what has long been 
a widespread practice. 
</P>
<P>
"You can no longer use public property as a free form of advertising," said 
Patrick D. Howard, director of the Public Works Department's Bureau of Street 
Maintenance. "This type of blight is offensive to a vast majority of the 
population. It is visual pollution. Our goal is to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
The tough law, approved by the City Council last August, was born of vehement 
complaints from San Fernando Valley and Westside homeowners who scorn the 
multitude of real estate and other signs that clutter city streets. At times 
over the past three years, anger has reached such heights that self-proclaimed 
"sign vigilantes" roved streets in the Valley and elsewhere ripping down outlaw 
posters to protest weak city sign ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
Although tacking signs on public property has been a misdemeanor offense for 
more than 40 years, city officials had to actually catch an offender in the act 
to bring charges. Only a handful of violators had been prosecuted in the last 
few years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There are about half a million illegally posted signs citywide on any given 
day, a figure arrived at through a sample survey of busy thoroughfares, street 
maintenance officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, introduced by north Valley Councilman Hal Bernson, established a 
principle called "rebuttable presumption," which assumes that the person 
benefiting from the sign can be held responsible for paying the cost of its 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
So, in Linder's case, as well as in scores of others involving everything from 
dance hall operators to religious organizations, 16 city work crews have torn 
and peeled away signs, tracked down the owners and billed the party for the 
cost of the removal job. Officials said the law applies equally to political 
candidates who post election placards. 
</P>
<P>
The first sign, regardless of its size, costs $190.40 to remove, an amount 
calculated by city accountants who tabulated the cost of a two-man crew, their 
new van, equipment and staff time to find the offender. Each additional sign 
costs $1.60 to remove because the crew is already on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Those who use glue to paste up signs will be charged $48.50 for each additional 
removal because it takes crews longer to scrape the paper away with a chemical 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
A two-person crew dons hard hats, gloves and goggles to remove up to 300 signs 
a day. And the work can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"All these staples and nails can come popping out at you," said Juan Reyes, 30, 
of Arleta who often uses a shovel or crowbar to pry off stubborn nailed-in 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
The workers take a Polaroid camera snapshot of the illegal posters for evidence 
and write down the information such as names, addresses and phone numbers on 
the sign. This is turned over to an inspector who tracks down and then bills 
the owner. 
</P>
<P>
In the first Dec. 15 billing, the city has charged offenders a total of 
$119,108 for their misdeeds. Officials hope to collect more than $600,000 in 
fines this year to pay for the cost of running the program. So far, only $1,847 
has been paid. Misdemeanor criminal charges may be filed against those who fail 
to pay within 30 days, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Many incensed violators claim they did not know the law was in place and have 
demanded first-offender leniency. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, said Rabbi Boruch Shlomo Cunin, of Chabad House in North Hollywood and 
West Los Angeles, the city will not charge his charitable organization $408 for 
posting dozens of "L'chayim to Life" telethon posters around town. "I intend to 
come to the hearing and bring the 1,000 posters we did not hang to show them 
since we became aware of the illegality of this," Cunin said. "We are a 
charitable organization that helps the homeless. We hope the city will be very 
kind to us and waive the fees." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they have been merciful to a few first-time offenders -- 
such as parents of children who hung up lost puppy signs and homeowners who 
hung garage sale signs. 
</P>
<P>
"I sent them a warning letter," said John Kissler, the West Valley inspector. 
"But if there is a second offense, they will be charged." 
</P>
<P>
But profit-takers beware. City officials said they have little sympathy for 
business people who use public property for personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going after people who post signs for commercial purposes as part of 
their business operations," said William E. White, chief street-use inspector. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Graves, a co-owner of Economy Electrical and Plumbing of Sun Valley, has 
been charged $388 for distributing about 200 signs advertising "Plumber 
Services" throughout the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The business we got from those signs kept us from going under when we started 
up last August," Graves said. "It was a cheap, effective and easy way to let 
people know we were out there." 
</P>
<P>
Since receiving the bill, Graves dispatched workers to remove his remaining 
signs. He said he intends to write off the charges as "the cost of doing 
business." 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish we could have gotten some kind of warning that this was against 
the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But another violator, the owners of about 300 fluorescent-colored signs 
throughout the Valley publicizing "Six Foot and Under Basketball," say they 
plan to fight their $816.80 bill. Ray Danish, a partner in the nonprofit Sports 
League, said that the city removal fee is "ridiculous. . . . It only costs us 
15 cents to hang them up. It shouldn't cost the city more than 20 cents to take 
them down. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Danish argued, "Our signs are neat and colorful. They should be 
allowed to stay up." 
</P>
<P>
But for folks like Richard Linder, who was trying to rent out a small house 
with his few hand-made signs, the lesson has been more sobering. 
</P>
<P>
"I know ignorance of the law is no excuse," Linder lamented. "But the bill came 
the day before Christmas. It just seems like such a high cost for my minor 
offense."

DRIVER WHO 'JUST WANTED TO GET HOME' KEEPS GOING IN BURNING, WRECKED CAR

The engine was on fire, the windshield was smashed in, two of the tires were 
flat, the roof was partially caved in and the right front side was ripped open. 
But Goorgen Hukassians of Saugus managed to drive his car about a mile in a 
vain attempt to get home after an accident Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy 
Steve Grossman of the Santa Clarita Valley Substation. Grossman arrested 
Hukassians at the scene on suspicion of hit-and-run driving, drunk driving and 
damage to city property. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible a car in that condition was able to move a foot, let alone as 
far as he got," the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman said that Hukassians, 22, who was able to walk away from the wrecked 
car, lost control of the Pontiac Fiero soon after he left the Golden State 
Freeway at the Valencia Boulevard exit. 
</P>
<P>
"For unknown reasons, he flips over once or twice -- he said he couldn't 
remember how many times," Grossman said, "and knocks over a fire hydrant near 
Rockwell Canyon Road in front of the College of the Canyons." 
</P>
<P>
But Hukassians managed to keep driving the car up Valencia Boulevard until it 
finally died near Bouquet Canyon Road, Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
A security guard working near the area reported a car on fire to the sheriff's 
office. When Grossman was on his way to the scene, he said, he heard a report 
on his police radio that the fire hydrant had been knocked over and was spewing 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured they were related, and the man who was driving the car did not deny 
hitting the fire hydrant," Grossman said. "But when I asked him why he had 
tried to drive away from the scene, he said, 'I was just trying to get home. I 
just wanted to get home.' "

COURTROOMS ENTER VIDEO AGE AS USE OF TAPED EVIDENCE IN TRIALS INCREASES; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: JUDGES AND LAWYERS SAY A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS. BUT SOME 
SAY WELL-EDITED VIDEOS CAN MISREPRESENT SITUATIONS. AND SOME LEGAL EXPERTS FEAR 
JURIES MAY GIVE UNDUE WEIGHT TO A VIDEO PRESENTATION.

<P>
In 1937, Josephine Heiman sued the Market Street Railway Co. for damages after 
she was hit by a streetcar in San Francisco. In her lawsuit, she claimed she 
had suffered devastating injuries and was left incapacitated by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
But when the case came to trial, lawyers for the railway showed a film that 
purported to show Heiman going about her normal activities shortly after the 
accident. Influenced by the film, jurors in the case gave the woman a far lower 
financial award than she had sought. 
</P>
<P>
That case demonstrated to lawyers the potential of moving pictures to support 
or contradict the testimony of witnesses in jury trials. But the high cost of 
making a film for use in court generally restricted the practice to wealthy 
parties involved in high-stakes cases. 
</P>
<P>
The development of low-cost video technology, however, has leveled the legal 
playing field. Now, numerous lawyers regularly use videos to help them make 
their cases. Videos reconstructing accidents, demonstrating allegedly faulty 
products and depicting a typical "day in the life" of a plaintiff have become 
common in California civil trials, including cases in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Videos were used recently, for example, in civil trials involving a paralyzed 
woman who was raped in a North Hollywood nursing home, a man injured in a 
Castaic Lake accident and an Encino woman collecting damages against the 
manufacturer of the Dalkon Shield. And lawyers plan to use videos in court in 
the case of a Simi Valley student hit by a car while crossing the street. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes videos are praised for helping jurors draw their own conclusions 
about a person, place or event without having to rely on witnesses' 
descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Video makes it possible for someone, even on a limited budget, to come into 
court and show the court what is happening somewhere," said San Fernando 
Superior Court Judge David Schacter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the old saying, a picture is worth a thousand words," said Van Nuys 
Superior Court Judge Thomas Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
Yet judges and lawyers say the recent cases in the Valley indicate that slick, 
well-edited videos can misrepresent situations by taking scenes out of context. 
And some legal experts fear juries may give undue weight to a video 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a sense that jurors are able to critically analyze television in 
the same way that they do a live person," said UCLA law school professor Paul 
Bergman, who teaches trial advocacy. 
</P>
<P>
"A lawyer will have to become almost like a film critic," Bergman said. "He 
will have to think about the other side's videotape and how to counter that." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent trial in San Fernando Superior Court, San Diego-based attorney 
David Brennan saw first-hand how easily raw video footage can be slanted to 
make a point. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan was defending Seacrest, the manufacturer of a motorized recreational 
water vehicle known as a wetbike, against a $15-million claim by a man who 
sustained major brain damage and other injuries in a 1982 collision between his 
wetbike and a motorboat on Castaic Lake. Richard S. Brownstein, the plaintiff, 
contended that the collision occurred because the wetbike was unstable and 
uncontrollable. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Brownstein's attorney showed a seven-minute video of a naval 
safety expert riding a wetbike. On the tape, the wetbike jumped out of the 
water several times as it crossed boat wakes. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan called his own expert witness to analyze the tape. The expert said that 
a single sequence during which the rider shook the bike to make it unstable had 
been edited into the tape at several points. Brennan also subpoenaed the 
plaintiff's unedited footage and played it in court. 
</P>
<P>
"We demanded the entire film that he had taken. When they viewed the totality 
of the film, they said, 'This is baloney.' They saw that he was perfectly 
capable of controlling the bike," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury eventually ruled that the wetbike manufacturer was not liable for 
causing Brownstein's accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Video is a powerful tool in the courts, but it can be manipulated pretty 
easily. Properly used, it can demonstrate truth to the jury. Unfortunately, you 
can do a variety of things to demonstrate something you are trying to prove, 
even if it isn't true," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
Other legal experts say that a particularly emotional video depicting a 
plaintiff's suffering may impair a jury's ability to rationally consider the 
facts of a case, as perhaps occurred in the case of Andree Nerpel. 
</P>
<P>
Nerpel, a severely brain-damaged woman, was raped and impregnated at the 
Laurelwood nursing home, and her family sued the North Hollywood facility for 
damages. The jury awarded her $7.5 million, but Judge David M. Schacter set 
aside the award because he said there was "not one shred of evidence" that the 
nursing home was negligent in caring for their patient. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Nerpel's attorney played a video of Nerpel as she lay 
helplessly in bed, semi-paralyzed and unable to speak as a result of injuries 
incurred in a 1969 automobile accident. The video showed her lifting her hand 
to grab her grandmother's hand, putting her hands behind her head and becoming 
agitated when a stranger came into the room. 
</P>
<P>
Richard B. Castle, the lawyer who represented the nursing home, said the 
videotape "clouded the issues" 
</P>
<P>
for the jurors, whose decision was based "purely on emotion." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Schacter and Castle agree the video had a place in the court. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the plaintiff in this case, and she had no other way to get here. The 
jury had a right to see that," Schacter said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers and legal video specialists admit that "day in the life" videos, which 
show the injuries sustained by a plaintiff in a civil suit, are designed to 
appeal to jurors' emotions. But, they said, it is important for jurors to 
understand exactly how a plaintiff's life has been affected by the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a documentary," said legal video producer Peter Meilen. 
</P>
<P>
Meilen recently filmed 14-year-old Jennifer Joyce, who was in a coma for 22 
days after she was hit by a car last May while crossing a street behind Sequoia 
Junior High School in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce's family is suing the city and the Simi Valley Unified School District 
for negligence for leaving the school's back gate open, allowing the students 
to cross the street unsupervised. 
</P>
<P>
To dramatize how Joyce's life has been altered since the accident, Meilen 
filmed her as she attended three hours of speech, occupational and physical 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
When Joyce banged her head on the table in frustration at her inability to 
follow the simplest of commands during her occupational therapy session, Meilen 
captured the moment. The hours of tape would eventually be cut to 35 minutes to 
be presented in court, but he said he thought that scene would stay. 
</P>
<P>
In response to criticism that such videos can be skewed with skillful editing, 
Meilen said: "We do try to select what we feel are the more poignant moments, 
but I am not creating anything other than what's there. We don't ask her to do 
anything different than she does in a normal day. We don't stage anything." 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about the potential for abuse of videos as evidence in trials are not 
new. They were voiced initially nearly 50 years ago, shortly after the 
California Supreme Court ruled that movies could be shown in court. The issue 
came to the court when Josephine Heiman appealed the use of the movie in her 
case against the Market Street Railway. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that there was no reason to bar moving pictures from being 
introduced as evidence in court, noting that movies are just a series of still 
photographs and that still photographs had long been accepted as admissible in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, however, a state appellate court warned judges that "moving 
pictures should be received as evidence with caution." 
</P>
<P>
"The modern art of photography and the devices of an ingenious director 
frequently produces results which may be quite deceiving. . . . Telescopic 
lenses, ingenious setting of the stage, the elimination of unfavorable portions 
of the film, the angle from which a picture is taken, and the genius of the 
director may tend to create misleading impressions," the decision stated. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent abuses, judges scrutinize the footage before the juries see it, to 
be sure a video does not misrepresent the events of the case in which it is 
introduced. If it does, a judge will rule the film inadmissible. 
</P>
<P>
Videos are also used, without controversy, to save time and money by recording 
the testimony of distant experts and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
When hundreds of women across the country sued the manufacturer of the Dalkon 
Shield, A.H. Robbins, the videotape deposition of Howard Tuttle became a 
cornerstone of many of their cases. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle was the former staff attorney for the company, and in his deposition, he 
testified that he had been ordered to shred company documents showing that 
Robbins had early indications of the dangers of the shield. 
</P>
<P>
"Dalkon Shield cases were tried all over the U.S. The video was shown all over 
the place," said Jeff Holl, a San Francisco-based attorney who represented many 
women in their claims against the Robbins company. 
</P>
<P>
Among those Holl represented was an Encino woman who sued A.H. Robbins in Van 
Nuys Superior Court and eventually was awarded $165,000. Judge Thomas 
Schneider, who heard the case, said the Tuttle tape lasted several hours and 
was critical to proving that the Robbins company had been negligent. 
</P>
<P>
In the pre-video era, his testimony would have been read to jurors from a 
transcript of a deposition taken earlier. But judges say jurors are likely to 
pay more attention to a deposition on video and can better evaluate the 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
In a video, "you can see the person talking, and the impact is better," 
Schneider said. "If someone licks their lips, that might be a sign of 
nervousness that you would never pick up in a written deposition." 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1987, legislators, recognizing the advantages of such testimony, 
amended the California Code of Civil Procedure so lawyers no longer needed 
special permission to introduce videotape depositions. The code was also 
changed to allow videos of experts to be used, even if the expert witness is 
available to testify in person. 
</P>
<P>
But it is a judge in Sandusky, Ohio, who has realized the full potential of 
using videos to save time. Since 1971, more than 300 civil trials in the Erie 
County Court of Common Pleas -- the equivalent of California's Superior Court 
-- have been conducted completely on video. 
</P>
<P>
In these trials, all the evidence is prerecorded, then edited by the judge, who 
removes any inadmissible testimony and the questions that prompted that 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
After selecting a jury, the lawyers make their opening statements live, then 
jurors watch a videotape of the evidence while the judge retires to his 
chambers to edit the testimony for the next trial. 
</P>
<P>
Common Pleas Judge James McCrystal, who initiated the video trials, said they 
are one-third faster than trials with live witnesses. He also said they are 
fairer, because jurors do not hear evidence that is later ruled inadmissible. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't ignore what you have already heard. As the old saying goes, you 
can't unring a bell," McCrystal said. 
</P>
<P>
During a videotaped trial, jurors never have to sit around while attorneys 
argue in chambers with the judge about admissible evidence, and the jurors are 
not influenced by attorneys' outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have polled more than 800 jurors. Most of them feel that they do a better 
job when the trial is on tape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McCrystal hopes videotaped trials will become the norm in the future. He 
travels around the country promoting the idea, but he said many attorneys are 
reluctant to try it because they enjoy "performing live" in front of a jury. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of losing center stage scares them to death," he said.

NEW DECADE ECONOMIC VIEW OF S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's increasingly diversified economy kept humming right along in 1989, 
with job and economic growth outperforming that of both the state and nation. 
But pundits were uncertain at year's end how well the region would withstand 
the deep cuts in defense spending planned by the Bush Administration for coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
During 1989, the San Diego region lost the headquarters of several publicly 
owned companies and financial institutions to mergers and acquisitions, lending 
substance to San Diego's image of being, essentially, a branch office town. 
Such an image would be reinforced if the proposed merger of San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric by SCEcorp, now midway through its second year of hearings and legal 
skirmishing, goes through. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism continued to flourish in 1989, with another bumper crop of visitors 
expected in 1990 with the new San Diego Convention Center heading into its 
first full year of trade shows and conventions. The center is expected to pull 
up to 14,000 additional visitors into San Diego each week, adding $250 million 
to 1990 visitor spending. 
</P>
<P>
And foreign manufacturers continued to flock to Baja California to set up 
maquiladoras, the in-bond plants where goods destined for the U.S. market are 
made with low cost Mexican labor. What was different in 1989 was that two heavy 
industrial manufacturers, Hyundai and Louisiana-Pacific, announced plans to set 
up operations in Tijuana and Ensenada, respectively. Heretofore, the 
overwhelming majority of maquiladoras have involved the assembly of components 
shipped in from foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego gross regional product, the sum of goods and services produced, 
grew by 4.6% in 1989, according to Wells Fargo Bank economist Joseph Wahed. 
That's down from the growth rates of the previous two years but still ahead of 
the state and U.S. overall. Jobs in San Diego County increased 3.7% to 1.1 
million over the year and the unemployment rate as of October was 3.8%, a full 
percentage point less than the state's. 
</P>
<P>
But the good times in San Diego over the past decade have been fueled in no 
small measure by the defense build-up sought by the Reagan Administration. And 
those dollars could drop off substantially if the Bush Administration carries 
out its aim to reduce defense spending by as much as $180 billion over a 
three-year period beginning in the 1991 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Direct defense expenditures in the county totaled $9.7 billion last year, or 
more than 20% of the county's gross regional product, and should come in at 
roughly the same amount in 1989, according to the Greater San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce's economic research department. Since 1975, defense spending has risen 
here nearly fivefold from $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Local economists generally view the San Diego economy as being diversified 
enough now to avoid the devastation that defense spending cuts wrought in the 
early 1960s. Still, any significant spending cut will be felt in a county that 
is home to 144,000 uniformed service men and women, 34,000 civilian employees 
and an estimated 72,000 workers directly involved in defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
There was a rash of acquisitions of locally based public companies and banks by 
outsiders during the year, including Gen-Probe (acquired by Chugai 
Pharmaceutical), Monitor Technologies (Lear Siegler Measurement Controls), 
Pancretec (Abbott Laboratories), Smith Laboratories (proposed merger with 
Columbia Hospital Corp.), Torrey Pines Bank (Wells Fargo), La Jolla Bank &amp; 
Trust and Southwest Bank (both by Security Pacific Corp.) 
</P>
<P>
Western Health Plans, parent of Greater San Diego Health Plan, filed for 
bankruptcy and sold its membership to a group of local hospitals. Both Syntro 
and Henley Group moved their headquarters away from San Diego and Cipher Data 
Products, which last month received an unsolicited takeover bid from Archive 
Corp. of Costa Mesa, could be on the verge of disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
The local business community was startled by the arrest of Yuba Natural 
Resources Chairman Richard Silberman in April in connection with attempted 
money laundering, one of a host of problems that the San Diego-based gold 
mining company faced. Silberman is the husband of county supervisor Susan 
Golding, a former partner of Jack in the Box fast food chain founder Robert O. 
Peterson and a former state cabinet secretary under California Governor Jerry 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The three major savings and loans headquartered in San Diego -- HomeFed Bank, 
Great American Bank and Imperial Savings -- each faced problems of varying 
degrees of seriousness in 1989 as did many other U.S. thrifts. All were 
knuckling under tough new capital standards imposed by the federal S&amp;L 
rescue bill passed over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Savings President Kenneth Thygerson, who resigned in July, saw the 
defeat of his "nontraditional" approach to S&amp;L management when ICA's junk 
bond portfolio of investments lost more than $200 million in market value, 
resulting in write-downs that left the S&amp;L with a negative net worth at 
year's end and vulnerable to a federal takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Great American continued to wrestle with its troubled Arizona loan portfolio 
which so far has caused the S&amp;L to take more than $100 million in loan loss 
reserves. Even HomeFed, the strongest of the three local thrifts, saw its stock 
price drop precipitously on reports of problems with its real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
A bright light in the local economic firmament was tourism. Visitor spending 
for the first 10 months of 1989 was up 5% over the previous year to $2.6 
billion. Total visitors were up 1.6% and hotel room nights sold rose 2.8%. The 
San Diego Convention Center which opened in late November but which will host 
its first full fledged convention this month, should bump those tourism 
increases up to even higher levels in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World of San Diego, one of the area's top tourist draws, was sold by parent 
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, along with five other theme parks, to Anheuser-Busch 
for $1.1 billion. The sale was necessitated by the need to pay down debt 
incurred by HBJ's costly restructuring in 1987.

HOTELS READY AND WAITING FOR CONVENTION CENTER TO FILL THEIR REGISTERS; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM: DELAYS IN THE CENTER'S CONSTRUCTION LEFT SAN DIEGO WITH A HOTEL ROOM 
GLUT, BUT OWNERS ARE HOPEFUL THAT 1990 WILL BE A DIFFERENT STORY. 
</P>

<P>
In June, 1985, hotel consultants Laventhol &amp; Horwath told developers in a 
report that if they didn't "get cracking" to build hotels in downtown San 
Diego, there would be a serious shortage of rooms by the time the San Diego 
Convention Center, then in its planning stages, opened its doors. 
</P>
<P>
Smelling the potential for profit, hoteliers heeded the call and began breaking 
ground on dozens of hotels countywide, eventually adding some 11,000 rooms to 
the county's supply over the next four years, a construction boom unequaled in 
the United States except in Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla., said Al Reese, 
spokesman for the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the consultants nor the developers could know that the Convention 
Center's opening would be plagued by two years of delays. Now, a few days 
before the center stages its first large-scale convention, San Diego finds 
itself in the midst of a hotel room glut that has given travelers more choice 
and better rates, but has made it more difficult for hotels to fill their rooms 
with guests. 
</P>
<P>
"When you add 11,000 rooms to any area, obviously the pie gets sliced a little 
thinner," said Larry Saward, general manager of the Sheraton Grand on Harbor 
Island. "With more rooms, the competition is keener, and that contributes, to 
some extent, to lower occupancy rates." 
</P>
<P>
Total hotel rooms in the county now number more than 40,000, a 50% increase 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county's average occupancy rate of 69.6% from January through 
October of last year is better than the national average of 68.4%, the figure 
represents a significant drop from previous years. In fact, the county's 
year-to-date occupancy rate has dropped 3.6% from the comparable 1988 period, 
and is at its lowest level since at least 1983, according to statistics 
compiled by Laventhol &amp; Horwath. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in occupancy occurred despite a 1.6% increase in overnight visitors 
to the San Diego area during the same period and a 2.8% rise in total hotel 
room nights sold. That the occupancy rate softened despite increased visitor 
traffic shows that hotel room supply is outpacing demand. 
</P>
<P>
But the glut may be short-lived, or so hotel owners hope. The San Diego 
Convention Center, which hosted its first consumer show in November and will 
stage its first full-fledged convention Wednesday through Saturday, is expected 
to generate 242,000 additional hotel room night sales in 1990, a 2.4% increase 
in demand by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
The center so far has booked 32 conventions and trade shows for 1990, ranging 
in size from 3,000 to 15,000 visitors per show, including such groups as the 
National Spa &amp; Pool Institute, the National Needlework Assn. and the Assn. 
of Secondary School Principals, Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
Through much of 1989, the oversupply of hotel rooms was quite beneficial to San 
Diego hotel guests. Overall, average room rates countywide for the first nine 
months of 1989 hardly budged from the previous year, increasing just 2 cents, 
to $78.35 per night, a rate of increase that didn't begin to keep pace with 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Average room prices were up only slightly in downtown, and bay-area hotels and 
hotels in Old Town on average had to cut prices by 3.4%, according to 
statistics compiled by the Pannell Kerr Forster accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
From a hotel owner's point of view, however, the addition of so many hotel 
rooms to the market before the city was able to generate enough demand had a 
devastating effect. Especially hard hit were those that lacked the meeting 
space needed to host large groups of visitors and that were depending on the 
Convention Center to fill its rooms with guests. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the Convention Center opening, originally set for 1987, developers 
began to build and restore a number of hotels in the 1980s, including the U.S. 
Grant, the Omni San Diego, the San Diego Marriott and the Horton Grand. 
</P>
<P>
But Convention Center construction soon fell behind schedule. Excavation of the 
waterfront site where the center would eventually stand took months longer than 
expected. Then, after the initial bids came in millions of dollars over budget, 
port officials reluctantly agreed to a rebid, which set back the construction 
date a full year. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Marriott, which timed the opening date of its second tower to 
coincide with the opening of the Convention Center, had no choice but to press 
forward with its construction plans, even if it meant opening nearly two years 
before the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Hotel development is not something you can turn on and off like a faucet," 
said Laventhol &amp; Horwath principal Greg Peerbolte. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Marriott suffered little from the delay in the Convention 
Center's completion. With more than 1,300 rooms, the Marriott has been able to 
stay in the black by hosting smaller business conventions and meetings, general 
manager Joel Rothman said. 
</P>
<P>
But for many other hotels, the delay wrought serious financial damage. Two 
years ago, the U.S. Grant filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal 
Bankruptcy Code, finally pulling out of its financial troubles last April. By 
that time, the Omni San Diego had also gone bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's common knowledge downtown that hotels were built, and this one restored, 
on the understanding that the Convention Center would be completed earlier," 
said U.S. Grant spokesman David Rushton. "The occupancy levels were not as high 
as anyone anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
Even with 32 trade shows and conventions scheduled for this year, officials 
predict it could be at least a year before the center begins operating at a 
pace that would satisfy the local hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I would venture to guess that within another couple of years, there might be 
another wave of hotels being booked," said Paul Desrochers, assistant vice 
president of the Centre City Development Corp. "It appears we could still 
support a couple more hotels in a couple years -- and I'm being conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Guthrie, director of sales and marketing for the Westgate Hotel in 
downtown San Diego, agreed: "I think a lot of us are glad 1989 is over. We had 
a lot of premature growth this last year, with a lot of rooms opening up before 
the Convention Center. But the downtown hotels will be immediately affected by 
the Convention Center opening, and certainly we're optimistic we'll have a much 
better year because of it." 
</P>
<P>
Reese, of the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, however, was more cautious 
about the immediate effect the Convention Center. His agency faces "a very 
serious challenge" trying to market San Diego to get the hotel rooms filled, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to do our best to bring it (the decline in occupancy rates) to an 
end, but, looking at the number of new hotel rooms that are scheduled to come 
on line here in the next few years, it is quite likely that it will continue." 
</P>
<P>
Estimates on the number of new hotel rooms expected to be added to the county's 
inventory next year range up to 2,250 new rooms, a 5.6% increase from the year 
before. Hotels expected to open this year include the Symphony Towers Marriott 
and the Pan Pacific Hotel, both downtown, the Radisson Inn in National City and 
the Carlsbad Village Hotel in North County. 
</P>
<P>
About half the new rooms will be located in downtown San Diego, with the 
majority of the rest in North County.

CIRCUIT CITY HAS BOOMED TO AN ELECTRONICS METROPOLIS 
</P>

People who like to stay home evenings, pop a frozen dinner in the microwave and 
watch a rented video have made Richard L. Sharp a happy man. 
</P>
<P>
"That's clearly one of the trends which has contributed to the popularity of 
the VCR and microwave," said Sharp, president and chief executive officer of 
Circuit City Stores Inc., which has ridden to phenomenal success the boom in 
the two consumer products over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp has seen his business grow from a small seller of consumer electronic 
items, with half its operations in other company's stores, to one of the 
nation's largest retailers of brand-name electronics and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit City operates in 53 U.S. markets, most of which have one or more of the 
company's huge Superstores displaying a vast array of wares. In 1989, the chain 
entered the local market as it opened stores in San Diego and National City. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the growth in operations and sales has come impressive stock gains. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit City's shares, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, increased 
more than 8,100% during the 1980s, from an adjusted-for-splits price of 26 
cents a share at the beginning of the decade to $21.75 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The gains made Circuit City one of the top 20 stock winners of the '80s. The 
company has 125 Superstores, usually 32,000-square-foot operations that feature 
rows and rows of stereos, televisions, freezers, refrigerators and other 
products. Roaming through the displays are aggressive sales personnel -- a 
large portion of the company's 15,000-member work force -- seeking out buyers 
for the low-priced goods. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit City still has 20 smaller stores, but Ann Collier, financial relations 
manager for the company, said those outlets eventually will be replaced with 
Superstores. 
</P>
<P>
The Richmond-based company's operations stretch along the Eastern Seaboard from 
Pennsylvania to Florida, and are in three Western states: California, Nevada 
and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the decade, almost half of Circuit City's 70 selling units, 
which then carried electronics but not appliances, were departments operating 
inside other stores, Collier said. 
</P>
<P>
But then the company repositioned itself to cash in on the popularity of VCRs 
and microwaves with its megastores. It also got out of New York City, where 
real estate prices prohibited the Superstore format, "to focus our resources in 
the areas of greatest opportunity," Collier said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, she said, 23% of the company's sales come from VCRs and video cameras, 
providing a nice balance to the 24% that comes from TV sales, 22% from audio 
equipment and 20% from appliances. Sales of other electronic items make up the 
remaining 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp, Circuit City's chief since 1986, pushed the company into five new 
markets in 1989, including its first stores in Philadelphia and Phoenix. He 
also replaced two regular stores with Superstores in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of its fiscal year, which ended Nov. 30, the 
company's sales reached $1.4 billion, a 21% increase over the same period a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Saut, director of research at the Richmond investment firm Branch, Cabell 
&amp; Co., was wary about recommending Circuit City stock. 
</P>
<P>
"If the economy is going to have a soft landing, it's a buy," he said, 
referring to the gentle reduction in economic activity than is the goal of the 
Federal Reserve Board. "If it's a hard landing, then it's questionable." 
</P>
<P>
Saut said the company's appliance sales are showing some weakness but that the 
electronics are still doing well. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp acknowledges that it's easier to grow faster when sales are $100 million 
a year instead of approaching $2 billion.

SABAN SEEKS OLDER TV AUDIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAMS: THE FOUNDER OF SABAN ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH PRODUCES CHILDREN'S SHOWS, 
TAKES THE LEAP TO PRIME TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Haim Saban can hardly sit still when he talks. The founder, chairman and chief 
executive of Burbank-based Saban Entertainment twitches nervously in his chair, 
cracks a joke, then jumps up and scurries across the room without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
But all this energy doesn't go unused. The 45-year-old Israeli native works 
16-hour days, seven days a week, trying to build his company into a diversified 
entertainment concern. 
</P>
<P>
Since he founded Saban Entertainment in 1980, Saban has primarily produced 
musical scores for children's programming, as well as producing children's TV 
shows. His programs include "Kidd Video," an MTV-like show that ran for two 
years on NBC, "ALF Tales," an animated fairy-tale adventure series currently on 
NBC, and "Camp Candy," an animated NBC series featuring the voice of actor John 
Candy. 
</P>
<P>
But Saban has bigger plans and is setting his sights on prime time. His company 
is producing six miniseries and TV movies, including "Phantom of the Opera," a 
miniseries starring Burt Lancaster and Charles Dance that will appear on NBC in 
the spring. The company is also producing its first late-night show, a 
comedy/variety series called "Offshore TV," hosted by the Hudson Brothers, 
which it plans to sell in first-run syndication. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens in this city is people specialize in areas," Saban said. "We 
don't want to be put in any niche. We're in kids, we're in first-run 
syndication, we're in prime time, we're in late night, and we intend to stay 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry veterans say the jump from daytime to prime time won't be easy. 
"You're dealing with a completely different type of audience," said Larry 
Friedericks, executive vice president of Fries International, a subsidiary of 
the television production company Fries Entertainment. "Having a cute little 
dog arfing is different than having dramatic actresses and actors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But prime-time shows can be far more lucrative than daytime children's shows, 
and Saban said he wants to be as diversified as possible. "Being in all those 
businesses allows us to hedge our bets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Saban moved to the United States in 1980, after a career as a record 
producer in France, his company has grown steadily, and in the past couple of 
years he's hired executives to help manage and maintain that growth. In August, 
he brought on Tom Palmieri, who quit his executive post at MTM Enterprises 
("The Bob Newhart Show," "St. Elsewhere," "Hill Street Blues"). Palmieri is now 
Saban's president. In 1988 Saban also hired Stan Golden from Horizon 
International TV to head Saban's international distribution arm. 
</P>
<P>
Palmieri said he moved to Saban because the company "reminded me of the way MTM 
was when I joined them nine years ago -- in the early stages, with a high 
energy level and a lot of things going on." 
</P>
<P>
In all, Saban produces or co-produces about 16 children's shows currently 
running on network, cable TV or in syndication. Palmieri said the company has 
grown fivefold since 1986 and will log "well in excess of $50 million" in 
revenues in 1989, although he declined to break down those figures. Since 
February, Palmieri said, Saban has funded more than $35 million in program 
production, and "everything is done out of our own working capital. We are 
completely debt free." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, one of Saban's most lucrative assets is its 1,050-title library 
of prime-time and children's programming, which includes Saban's own 
productions and rights it acquired to other programming by foreign and domestic 
companies. The library includes series such as "Unsolved Mysteries," the 
docudrama based on real-life crimes, as well as various animated children's 
series, such as foreign-made versions of "Pinocchio" and "Peter Pan." 
</P>
<P>
The company distributes the titles in foreign markets such as Britain, Germany, 
France, Switzerland and Australia. Many of these countries have a strong demand 
for American-made entertainment because of the deregulation of television and 
the growth of satellite and cable. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the momentum, Saban recently teamed with Edgar Scherick, a veteran film 
and TV producer who was the head of programming at ABC-TV during the 1960s. 
Saban/Scherick Productions, a division of Saban Entertainment, will focus on 
miniseries and made-for-TV movies. Scherick was a producer of feature films 
such as "Sleuth" and "The Heartbreak Kid," and, more recently, TV movies and 
miniseries such as "Little Gloria . . . Happy at Last," and "The Kennedys of 
Massachusetts." 
</P>
<P>
Saban/Scherick's first efforts are the "Phantom of the Opera" miniseries, and 
"The Secret Life of Ian Fleming," a movie that will appear on the TNT cable 
network early this year. 
</P>
<P>
Industry veterans say the partnership with Scherick will help give Saban 
credibility when dealing with the networks. "It's a smart play," said TV 
producer Leonard ("Rags to Riches") Hill. But he warned that luring Scherick 
was only "a first tentative step" for Saban, and that the company will need to 
establish a stable of successful producers in order to become a major 
competitive force. "The only prime-time, creative, credible entity within Saban 
is Edgar Scherick," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Saban got into show business when he started managing bands in Israel at the 
age of 22. He was a well-known music promoter by age 25. But when the 1973 Yom 
Kippur War broke out, Saban lost nearly all his money. 
</P>
<P>
Starting over in France with his partner, composer Shuki Levy, Saban soon 
became a successful record producer. Saban Record's first release, by a 
9-year-old Israeli boy, Noam Kaniel, went platinum with sales of 2 million 
copies. Within seven years, the company had 15 gold and platinum records. 
Meanwhile, Saban Records began creating sound tracks for French TV shows and 
for the European versions of American shows such as "Dallas" and "Hart to 
Hart." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Saban decided to move to the United States, and after spending 
$150,000 to build a recording studio here, he began targeting the market for TV 
sound tracks. By 1983 his company had formed an association with Burbank-based 
DIC Enterprises, a leading producer of animated children's programs. Saban 
produced original sound tracks to DIC shows such as "Inspector Gadget." In 
1985, Saban launched into program production by co-producing with DIC "Kidd 
Video," a show for children that mixed animation with live action in an 
MTV-like format. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Tucker Vinson, vice president of children's programming for NBC, 
recalled meeting Saban in the early 1980s and being impressed with his new 
ideas. "We had been looking for a way to update Saturday morning music," said 
Vinson. Saban "offered to do some demos for us. He came up quickly with a theme 
we liked. It was more contemporary and hip, and we thought kids were listening 
to hip music on radio and then tuning into TV and hearing babyish sounds." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Saban continues to run the business end of things, while his original 
partner, Levy -- who is married to actress Deborah Shelton of "Dallas" fame -- 
continues to write music. 
</P>
<P>
Saban said he hopes to expand the company through acquisitions. He is also 
"dabbling" with a new record label and has signed his first artist, actor and 
musician Gary ("The Buddy Holly Story") Busey.

VALLEY EARNINGS: SFE TECHNOLOGIES LOSSES GROW IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SFE Technologies, a San Fernando electronics firm, reported its losses widened 
to $8.8 million in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Oct. 28 from a 
$3-million loss a year earlier. Revenues fell 20% to $7 million from $8.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The loss in the latest period included a $7-million charge to provide for a 
writedown for excess and obsolete inventory. SFE Chairman William Kuehn, who 
joined the company in November, said SFE is repositioning itself from mass 
markets for electronic components to manufacturing more specialized electronic 
components for use by the military and private industry. 
</P>
<P>
For the year that ended Oct. 28, SFE said it lost $9.7 million, compared to a 
$4.3-million loss in fiscal 1988. Revenues were $30.4 million, down 16% from 
$36.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Kuehn said SFE's West-Cap Arizona subsidiary negotiated a plea 
agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. West-Cap agreed to plead guilty 
to two counts involving violations of quality control testing and reporting 
procedures for electronic components West-Cap manufactured for the military. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty West-Cap faces is a $10,000 fine per count, which may be 
increased to $50,000, plus restitution, Kuehn said. He expects the West-Cap 
matter to be resolved by June.

THOMAS BROS. BEGINS COMPUTER MAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Thomas Bros., the venerable map maker that has helped guide generations of 
Southern California drivers, entered the high-tech era last month with the 
release of its first book of fully computer-generated maps. 
</P>
<P>
The new guide for Sacramento is the first product of a three-year effort by 
Thomas Bros. to develop a system for electronically storing and updating the 
millions of pieces of information that go into a street map. 
</P>
<P>
The first Los Angeles and Orange counties guide to use the new system will be 
published in about a year. Warren Wilson, president and chief executive officer 
of Thomas Bros., said the company hopes to have all of its 24 map books 
computerized within two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento guide features a new, brighter cover, and is slightly larger 
than the traditional guide. 
</P>
<P>
The map pages have a cleaner look, with more color and better graphics, and the 
text is larger and easier to read. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Sacramento is serving as a trial site because it has the right mix 
of characteristics and is not an important market for the company, which serves 
every county in California and several other areas in Western states. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Bros.' digital mapping system converts geographical information from 
aerial photographs into millions of bits of information that can be stored and 
manipulated by a computer. Once the basic data is in the system, it can be 
augmented or amended easily with a few keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important, having a computer database of map information will enable 
Thomas Bros. to generate special-purpose maps and other information that might 
be useful to businesses, government agencies, universities or individuals. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Wilson said the company would be using data collected in the 
1990 census and combining it with its map information to produce maps showing

The company has set up a new subsidiary, called Thomas Bros. Information 
Systems, to develop and market specialized products derived from the master 
database. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be moving into these ancillary product areas, as well as publishing 
traditional guides," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Thomas Bros. has invested $3 million to $4 million thus far in 
developing the digital mapping system. 
</P>
<P>
One of Thomas Bros.' biggest concerns in launching the new guides is that they 
will use a new page and grid system that will not correspond to the old system. 
For customers who count on the Thomas Bros. reference points to find a 
location, the guide provides a conversion chart, and the company has 
established a toll-free phone number to respond to any questions.

The American auto industry underwent more wrenching change in the 1980s than in 
any era since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The decade began with an energy crunch and an economic slump that left 
Detroit's Big Three reeling. 
</P>
<P>
It is ending with the Big Three slipping once more into recession and their 
Japanese rivals still setting the pace in the car market. Despite a 
multibillion-dollar drive by the domestic industry to catch up, Detroit never 
has been able to match Japanese car makers on quality. 
</P>
<P>
And car buyers are increasingly turning their backs on the domestics. In 1980, 
Japanese manufacturers held 19.7% of the American car market; today, they have 
24.66%, a figure held back by import quotas imposed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Japanese are leapfrogging Detroit to compete head-on with European 
firms in the luxury market, and, as a result, sales of pricey West German and 
British cars are starting to slide. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese car makers have moved much of their production to the 
United States in order to skirt trade restraints. They now have eight assembly 
plants in this country and soon will have the capacity to build 2 million cars 
and trucks a year here -- roughly the same as Chrysler's North American 
production. 
</P>
<P>
To compete, Detroit has been forced to form a complex web of joint ventures 
with Japanese and European companies. Ford, for instance, now counts on Mazda 
of Japan for its subcompact development, Kia of Korea to assemble its smallest 
cars and Ford of Europe to develop its mid-size cars. Meanwhile, it has just 
purchased Jaguar to compete with the German luxury car builders. 
</P>
<P>
As the 1990s begin, import restraints remain in place on Japanese cars but now 
seem irrelevant because of Japan's U.S. production facilities. The major 
Japanese auto makers are not even filling their quota allocations from Japan 
because they are selling so many American-built cars. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1990s, look for Japanese car makers to take on an increasingly 
American look. JAMES RISEN

The defense industry's thrill ride up the Reagan Administration military 
spending boom is quickly changing into one of the scariest plunges in the 
industry's long history, threatening a major consolidation in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s opened with a national consensus to rebuild America's military 
forces, a goal that led to a doubling of defense acquisition and the awarding 
of major weapons programs to virtually every prime contractor in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
But a series of national scandals involving criminal fraud in the industry, 
overpriced spare parts and faulty weapons systems led to a congressional 
backlash. Regulations exploded, profit margins were squeezed and financing 
terms became penurious, forcing major increases in debt loads. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, the Reagan spending boom encouraged the industry to add industrial 
capacity at a time when most experts agreed that there was already excess 
capacity. Another Pentagon policy of fostering competition failed to cut costs, 
but profits suffered. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, the great boom had already peaked and leveled out, though the long 
pipeline of funding from Washington continued to allow many contractors to grow 
for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Although the thawing of the Cold War has just begun, it already seems likely 
that the nation's 2.2-million-member armed forces will be reduced -- and the 
arms industry along with it. Annual spending on defense has already been 
declining at 2% after inflation for several years, and political pressure is 
building to accelerate that decline. 
</P>
<P>
Excess capacity will have to be reduced; some companies will leave the defense 
industry permanently, and contractors will be thinned out further by mergers 
among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But the aerospace industry has a bright future in commercial aircraft, in which 
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have backlogs that will extend production into the 
next century. And the civilian space program is growing rapidly once again.

For Hollywood, the opening act of the 1980s was sheer warfare. The major 
studios battled outsiders who sought to distribute movies through new 
technologies such as cable networks and home videocassettes. MCA Inc. and Walt 
Disney Co. fought Sony Corp.'s importation of video players all the way to the 
U.S. Supreme Court, and MCA and several other studios tried to foil Time Inc.'s 
Home Box Office by launching their own pay-cable service. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood lost both battles, but it pocketed awesome sums of money from the 
licensing of its movies to the new players. Now, video and cable sales generate 
about 57% of Hollywood's revenue -- compared to about 30% earned at the box 
office, according to Paul Kagan Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Being pragmatic, the major studios have been merging with one-time enemies. The 
common quest: to control not only the programming but strategic portions of the 
distribution "pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
In the past year alone, Warner Communications Inc. combined with Time Inc., and 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment agreed to an acquisition by Sony. Three years 
earlier, 20th Century Fox Film Corp. joined the global empire of Rupert 
Murdoch, who spent more than $2 billion to buy the studio and seven TV stations 
and is now building a satellite-delivery TV service in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The entertainment industry will be dominated in the 1990s by such media giants, 
according to some analysts, who add Tele-Communications Inc., Disney and 
Capital Cities/ABC to the list. (Indeed, control of all three TV networks 
changed hands in the '80s, with only CBS not now owned by a huge conglomerate.) 
</P>
<P>
The decade had its subplots, of course -- and some befit the propaganda films 
of the 1940s. Little was said when Australians bid for Hollywood studios, but 
the arrival of Japanese buyers has touched a nationalistic nerve. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Isgur, Paine Webber's veteran entertainment industry analyst, predicts that 
the power of American film making will speed Japanese assimilation into Western 
culture, rather than the other way around. "The joke," said Isgur, "is did we 
buy Japan, or did they buy Columbia Pictures?" KATHRYN HARRIS

<P>
The oil business started the 1980s with gas lines, stalled with a worldwide oil 
price collapse, accelerated with a wave of megamergers, stalled again when the 
Exxon Valdez ran aground and is now creeping cautiously into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the nation's demand for energy will confront environmental 
worries in the wake of the Valdez incident, drilling bans, clean-air laws and 
concerns about global warming, the so-called greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices that fell in 1986 to about $9 should hold at the current $19 or $20 
a barrel at least through the early part of the decade. Such prices would help 
the recovery of an industry still reeling from a decade of restructuring, 
downsizing and streamlining. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990s could see a modest resurgence of alternative sources of energy -- 
perhaps even a smaller, safer nuclear industry. But most analysts expect 
continued reliance on oil. 
</P>
<P>
New technology should lead to more efficient energy use and improve production 
from existing U.S. wells. Currently off-limits areas such as the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge and coastal areas could eventually be opened to 
exploration. 
</P>
<P>
But few analysts expect U.S. oil production to turn up again, and the U.S. oil 
industry will become more international, with most exploration and production 
taking place overseas -- especially in Pacific Rim areas. 
</P>
<P>
The big question will be when oil companies can expect the already overdue 
collapse of the so-called natural gas bubble, or oversupply. New clean-air 
regulations should increase demand for cleaner-burning gas, which is also used 
to make methanol and other alternative fuels. That would lead to higher prices 
-- and that would be good news for U.S. companies with sizable reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Because U.S. oil and gas production fell in the 1980s, imports increased, and 
that has set the stage for a re-emergence of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries as a world force -- if it can keep quotas in line. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, national oil companies of countries such as Kuwait, Venezuela and 
Saudi Arabia will dominate the worldwide industry, analysts say. Those 
companies will continue moving into the refining and marketing end of the 
business in the United States and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
As the 1980s showed, developments in the oil business can come swiftly and 
unexpectedly, and analysts are not ruling out price shocks or shortages later 
in the decade. PATRICK LEE

POLITICAL CHANGES BOLSTER STOCK INVESTMENTS ABROAD; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETS: EXCHANGES IN JAPAN AND EUROPE POSTED DOUBLE-DIGIT GAINS IN 1989. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The planned 1992 unification of Europe and the opening of the Eastern Bloc 
created the prospect of economic opportunities that propelled major foreign 
stock markets to double-digit gains in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Investors worldwide scrambled to put money on the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. investors pumped money into mutual funds that invest in Europe, and the 
Japanese set up their own stock funds invested specifically in West German 
companies, seen as the most immediate beneficiaries of the Iron Curtain's 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, foreign appetite for German stocks has helped boost the 
Frankfurt market to an annual net gain of 35%. 
</P>
<P>
But Germany's market performance was not an isolated one. Key stock indexes in 
London and Milan also rose impressively, as did the world's largest stock 
market, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's stock market seemed to be on a record-setting spree throughout the 
year. The 225-issue Nikkei stock index opened the year at a record high of 
30,243.66; it finished the year Friday at 38,915.87, the fourth-consecutive day 
of record closings and a 29% gain over 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Tokyo said the market overcame a number of obstacles this year, 
including the death of Emperor Hirohito in January, political instability, 
currency fluctuations and fear of creeping inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The market's strength was underscored in October when the Nikkei failed to 
follow Wall Street's precipitous Oct. 13 drop, when the Dow Jones industrial 
index fell 7.1% in value. 
</P>
<P>
The key British stock index fell 3.2%, and the Frankfurt market lost 13.2% in 
response to Wall Street's drop, but Tokyo shares declined only 1.8% before 
rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the mini-crash, "the biggest event of the year is the opening up of 
Eastern Europe," said Robert Rolland, executive vice president at Shearson 
Lehman Hutton Inc., in New York. "That's definitely the theme going into the 
'90s, and it obviously overshadows any one-day drop in the stock market." 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the FAZ 100-share index rose 35% to finish the year at 740.90, up 
from 549.86 at the start of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Rolland characterized the recent buying of German stocks and stock funds -- 
particularly by the Japanese -- as "almost a frenzy." Because German stocks 
typically are not split, their prices can become prohibitively expensive. 
Deutsche Bank, for example, is trading in the $490-a-share range. 
</P>
<P>
But the Germany Fund, a closed-end mutual fund that trades on the New York 
Stock Exchange, can be had for $19 a share, Rolland said. About a year ago the 
Germany Fund sold for $6.625 a share. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished the year 
at 2,422.7, up from 1,793.1 at the beginning of 1989. Investors were attracted 
to British companies because they have issued little debt in comparison to 
their American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
But volume was disappointing, prompting investment firms to cut costs through 
layoffs and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Europe, takeover fever gripped France in 1989 and helped push the 
CAC-40 index up 27% on the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only was it takeovers driving the market, but the possibility of takeovers 
. . . ahead of 1992," when Europe will meld into a single, barrier-free market, 
Rolland said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the larger deals, the bank holding company Cie. Financiere de Suez took 
over Cie. Industrielle and its insurance subsidiary Groupe Victoire for about 
$4.1 billion after a brief but bitter fight. 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, the key BCI index rose 17%, to 687.44 on Friday from 589.72. Italy 
also is positioning itself for 1992, but the country's overwhelming debt -- 
which roughly equals its gross national product -- has created drag on the 
stock market, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a perception of negativity" in Italy, said Guy Stern, an analyst at 
ABD Securities Corp. in New York. "They have to re-evaluate their national 
strategy and how they will expand." 
</P>
<P>
The Italian market began to rally in late May when giant Fiat announced a major 
share buyback program, but it stumbled later over an Italian bank's 
unauthorized loans to the Iraqi government. The country was dealt a further 
blow when Fiat failed to strike a deal with the Swedish auto maker Saab, which 
instead allied itself with General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The unheralded growth market was Spain. It is not yet attracting much foreign 
capital, and the Madrid General Index rose just 8% this year. But Stern noted 
that, except for Portugal, Spain has the fastest growing gross domestic product 
of any European country.

The 1990s will realize some of Wall Street's brightest hopes and darkest fears. 
</P>
<P>
The decade will bring a much closer integration of world capital markets, a 
development that will sharply increase demand for brokerage and underwriting 
services. But with the new integration will come booming competition from 
abroad and home, shaving profits in some areas razor thin. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street firms were preparing for this new reality in the 1980s. Many sought 
to bolster their financial resources by merging or forming alliances with 
wealthy outsiders. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. was purchased by General Electric, 
for example, while Paine Webber sold an 18% stake to Yasuda Mutual Life 
Insurance, and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. sold a 12.5% stake to Sumitomo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The need for capital was partly due to the threat of increased competition from 
commercial banks, which were barred from the securities business for half a 
century by the Glass-Steagall Act. With deregulation, the act has been slowly 
unwound. And the one remaining barrier -- which prevents commercial banks from 
underwriting stock issues -- eventually may be swept away as well. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the tough new competitive climate, analysts expect Wall Street's big 
full-service firms to be forced to become much more nimble in the 1990s, 
jumping quickly into new ventures and out of them just as quickly if they don't 
pay off. This means that the big firms' payrolls will rise and fall swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
Merger advice, which has provided up to 40% of some big investment banks' 
earnings in this decade, will probably earn them less over the next several 
years if a recession materializes. Further out, however, integration of the 
world economy will set off a new round of corporate mergers. There may also be 
big moneymaking opportunities as the U.S. firms that have taken on so much debt 
in the 1990s issue new stock, sell assets or take other steps to strengthen 
their financial positions. 
</P>
<P>
For the regional stock brokerages that sell investments to individuals, life in 
the 1990s may change much less. Their best customers, Americans over 50 years 
old, will grow sharply in number and will still be willing to pay well for 
financial services. PAUL RICHTER

When Southern California residents fill out their 1990 census forms this 
spring, most will assume that they're participating in more than just another 
marketing survey. The census, after all, is carried out by the federal 
government under a constitutional mandate, and its avowed purpose is to count 
the population so that political representation and government funds can be 
properly distributed. 
</P>
<P>
But the census also serves as a comprehensive study of American consumers, 
producing reams of information on the income and life styles of people who live 
in a certain county or on a particular city block. It's the kind of demographic 
information that makes marketing strategists drool, and no other data source 
can touch the census in terms of its scope and accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise, then, that census information is sold and resold and 
reshuffled for an incredible array of business purposes. "Virtually every 
business uses census data," said Mark Baldassare, a professor of social ecology 
at the University of California, Irvine who uses the census extensively 
himself. "It's omnipresent." 
</P>
<P>
Retailers use census information in deciding where to locate new stores. Banks 
use it in determining how to market certificates of deposit. Health-care 
companies use it to plan new services. Maura Eggan, marketing director for 
South Coast Plaza, puts it simply, "The census shows where our customers are, 
and in what numbers." 
</P>
<P>
The basic census questionnaire -- which will be sent to every home in the 
country by April 1 -- simply records the number of people in a household, their 
ages, sex, marital status, race and the type of housing in which they reside. 
That's useful information for any marketing department. 
</P>
<P>
But even more mouthwatering is the information that comes from the so-called 
long form, or sample form -- sent to one out of every six households, which 
involves 45 additional questions that elicit detailed information on household 
income, mortgage payments, commuting patterns, energy usage and many other 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of information collected in the census is so staggering, however, 
that making good use of it can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau, which spends $2.6 billion collecting the information, does 
not slice and dice the data to fit every possible use, and not many businesses 
have the computer equipment or manpower to crunch the numbers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The basic data set has another liability: With 10 years between censuses, it 
gets old. And it takes the Census Bureau so long to compile everything -- the 
basic 1990 "head count" should be ready by year-end, but much of the more 
detailed data will not be available until 1993 -- that some of the information 
is old even before it's published. 
</P>
<P>
Solving these two problems is how the raft of independent information vendors 
make their livings. Companies such as Donnelley Marketing Information Services, 
National Planning Data Corp., Urban Decision Systems Inc. and National Decision 
Systems function as what Jeri Denniston, marketing manager at National 
Decisions Systems in Encinitas, calls "value-added resellers of census data." 
</P>
<P>
For a price, these firms will provide demographic data for any population area. 
Thinking of a new store at a certain intersection? A profile of the population 
within a 2-mile radius of that intersection -- or a 20-mile radius, or a 
200-mile radius -- is just a phone call away. "We repackage, reformat and 
resell the data in bite-sized chunks," said Jim Paris, senior associate at Los 
Angeles-based Urban Decision Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau tabulates data in a geographic hierarchy that begins with 
city blocks and moves through groups of blocks, cities, counties, states and 
the nation as a whole. But, for example, pulling out the precise block groups 
that are necessary to define a certain area can be a painstaking process for 
the unequipped. 
</P>
<P>
The information vendors also continually update the census information and 
develop projections by using sophisticated statistical techniques and other 
sources of information varying from state Department of Finance surveys to 
postal delivery records. Donnelley also incorporates information collected by 
other units of parent company Dun &amp; Bradstreet, such as A. C. Nielsen and 
Dun's Marketing Services. 
</P>
<P>
And for customers who want it, the information companies will go even further 
and overlay highly detailed life style profiles onto the demographic profiles. 
They'll tell you not only how much money people in a certain neighborhood make, 
how much education they have, and how many cars they own (information that 
comes directly from the census), but also what make of car they're likely to 
drive, how often they eat out, and what vacation destinations they frequent 
(information extrapolated from marketing and sociological studies). 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the census data is several times removed from its original source. 
Several years ago, Mel Curland needed more Volvos for his booming Mission Viejo 
dealership, but he was having trouble persuading executives in Sweden to give 
him a larger allocation. The tremendous affluence and high growth rates in 
southern Orange County, it seems, were not very obvious to Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
Curland needed figures to show that the people in his market area fit Volvo's 
profile of the typical Volvo customer. 
</P>
<P>
He got those figures from Market Profiles, a Costa Mesa consulting company, 
which had, in turn, purchased them from Urban Decision Systems, which itself 
had bought them from the Census Bureau and then updated them with some of its 
own data. Curland said he ultimately got the additional cars. 
</P>
<P>
Larger businesses, however, often get closer to the primary source. Census 
information can be purchased directly from the Census Bureau in printed form or 
on computer tapes, and this year for the first time some data will be offered 
on optical disks, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Buying the tapes -- at about $175 each -- is a practical option only if a 
company has a mainframe computer and some in-house programming capabilities, 
but for big companies that's not too big an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Stiles, marketing research manager at FHP Inc., a health maintenance 
organization in Fountain Valley, said his company has purchased directly from 
the Census Bureau as well as from outside providers, but that it is now relying 
more heavily on the latter. "The bureau is a data dumper. You can filter it 
yourself, but it gets to be a headache," he said. "The vendors will organize it 
for you." 
</P>
<P>
FHP, Stiles added, uses the information for a broad variety of purposes. If the 
company is considering entering a new market area, it will look at the profile 
of the population there and see how it compares with areas where the company 
currently does well. In an existing market area, the company will compare the 
characteristics of members and non-members to see who is using the services. 
</P>
<P>
FHP also uses census data classified by ZIP code to assist in its targeted 
mailing efforts, an application that is extremely valuable for any company that 
sells its products or services via the post office. 
</P>
<P>
And though the information vendors claim that their updates are extremely 
accurate -- and that the new data from the 1990 census is therefore not a huge 
event -- some of the users are not so sure. Stiles noted that the projections 
get weaker and weaker every year beyond the census and that staying up-to-date 
is especially difficult in a fast-growing and fast-changing area such as Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census form, although mostly unchanged from 1980, contains a few 
innovations that will make it even more useful for local businesses. For 
example, the multiple-choice question on housing value now uses $500,000 or 
over as the top classification; the old category of $200,000 or over was 
virtually useless in much of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers are excited that the census will for the first time ask about second 
mortgages, one of the hottest areas of bank lending. 
</P>
<P>
And though everyone will have to wait a couple of more years for all the 
information, the data promises to be more accessible than ever before. Not only 
are there more information vendors doing more things with it, but the Census 
Bureau itself is also working to disseminate the data in more usable forms. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Hugg, an information specialist with the Census Bureau's regional office 
in Van Nuys, noted that some information will now be available not only in 
published reports -- the basic source for seven out of 10 users -- and computer 
tapes, but also on optical disks that can be read by properly equipped personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the data is available on-line through some electronic information 
services, and the bureau will produce printouts of data that is not contained 
in published reports. 
</P>
<P>
And considering what you get, it's not very expensive. Summary reports in 
published form cost from $29 to $50, and in 1980 the entire census data bank -- 
711 mainframe computer tapes -- could be purchased for $124,425, said Paris of 
Urban Decision Systems. Hugg said there will be "thousands" of tapes for the 
1990 count, so it might be a bit more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
VALUABLE DATA: 1990 is the year of the census, and that's a boon for marketing 
strategists. The nationwide count yields unequaled demographic information.

Raytheon Co. won a $273.7-million contract to build three sophisticated 
over-the-horizon radar systems for the Navy, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The work, to be done at its manufacturing plant in Waltham and engineering 
facilities in Sudbury and Wayland, will not require new hiring but will "help 
maintain our manufacturing (employment) base," said Maria McClellan, a company 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The market for such systems could nearly quadruple to about $1 billion in the 
next few years, McClellan said. 
</P>
<P>
The current contract should be completed by July, 1993, she said.

ROSE BOWL: MICHIGAN'S SCHEMBECHLER FINISHES CAREER AT 2-8 IN PASADENA AS USC 
WINS ON LATE TOUCHDOWN.

<P>
Bo Schembechler's coaching career ended just like so many of his seasons at 
Michigan -- with a loss in the Rose Bowl and without a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
And with Bo seething at the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I won't miss in retirement is incompetent officials," he said 
after his 27-year coaching career ended with a 17-10 loss to No. 12 Southern 
California. "It's the most unbelievable call and I got it in my last game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a Pac-10 official and it happens every time I come out here." 
</P>
<P>
As do losses in the Rose Bowl -- Schembechler was 2-8 in the New Year's Day 
game. 
</P>
<P>
His ire was provoked by a costly penalty that turned the tide to Southern Cal 
late in the game. The Wolverines, with fourth-and-2 from their 46, picked up 24 
yards and a first down on a run by Chris Stapleton off a fake punt. 
</P>
<P>
But the play was called back on a holding penalty against Michigan. 
Schembechler then yelled at the officials, who threw a flag in his direction 
and marched off 15 more yards to go with the 10-yard assessment for holding. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines then punted, and Southern Cal began the winning drive from its 
25-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over, unfortunately I lost my last game," said Schembechler, who 
announced Dec. 13 that the Rose Bowl would close his coaching career. "We 
couldn't seem to get anything going. We really did not play a very good 
football game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm mad because we lost the game, but there's nothing we can do." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans (9-2-1), snapping a two-game losing streak in the Rose Bowl, got 
the winning touchdown on a 14-yard run by Ricky Ervins, the game's most 
valuable player, with 1:10 remaining. The score capped the 75-yard drive 
engineered by Todd Marinovich in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was Bo's last game but we put that out of our minds," said Michigan 
safety Vida Murray. "We knew what we needed to do, but we just couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler, whose Wolverines beat Southern Cal 22-14 in the Rose Bowl a year 
ago, will remain the school's athletic director. Assistant Gary Moeller will 
become the head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler wound up his head coaching career with a 234-65-8 record, 
including 194-48-5 during 21 years at Michigan. He finished as the fifth 
winningest coach in Division 1-A history, four behind Woody Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just the ole whistle-tooter," Schembechler said. "I have to go, but I'll 
always be Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
Southern Cal's Larry Smith, who began his college coaching career as an 
assistant under Schembechler and remains his friend, said, "I'm sorry that he's 
leaving the game. But you never apologize for winning." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a football game. He wouldn't have wanted me to coach any differently," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Ervins, asked if it was of special significance to play against Schembechler in 
the coach's last game, said, "No. ... The fact that it was the Rose Bowl made 
it a big game." 
</P>
<P>
Ervins carried 30 times for 126 yards, and broke off tackle to score the 
winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Redshirt freshman Marinovich guided the Trojans on the winning march beginning 
with 5:15 to play, including a 20-yard completion to John Jackson on 
third-and-5 at the Michigan 44. 
</P>
<P>
USC led at the half, 10-3. But that relatively uneventful score was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the 1990 Rose Bowl game was marked by strange decisions by 
each team. Or, in a number of cases, strange non-decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The strangest involved USC's version of a late drive before the half ended. 
After holding Michigan deep in its own territory and forcing the Wolverines 
into a punting situation, USC blithely let the clock tick seconds off while 
Michigan slowly got its punting team on the field. This despite the fact that 
the Trojans had all three of their timeouts remaining. 
</P>
<P>
When USC took over at its 26 after a punt return of eight yards by Calvin 
Holmes and a clipping penalty of 15 yards, there was only 1:37 left to play in 
the half. Shortly before Michigan fielded its punting team, there had been more 
than two minutes on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Then, having put themselves up against much tougher odds than necessary, USC 
marched down the field like a Johnny Unitas-led pro team working a two-minute 
drill. Soon, freshman quarterback Todd Marinovich had the Trojans at the 
Michigan seven after scrambling 23 yards. But rather than call a timeout, 
Marinovich chose, strangely, to re-gather his team and set up for a snap. He 
then threw the ball over Joel Scott's head to stop the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Ervins rushed to the four, and USC took its first timeout with 27 seconds 
left. Next, Marinovich rolled left and threw into a crowd. The pass was broken 
up, but USC got another break when holding away from the ball was called 
against Michigan. That carried with it an automatic first down and put the ball 
at the Wolverine two. 
</P>
<P>
With 21 seconds to play and two timeouts left, Marinovich rolled left again, 
was rushed and clearly dumped the ball off intentionally. That's the way the 
officials called it, putting the ball back on the Michigan 19 and causing loss 
of down. 
</P>
<P>
On second down from the 19, Marinovich rolled left yet again, was rushed, but 
found Frank Griffin, a backup tight end, wide open in the middle of the field. 
Griffin caught the pass, started up field but slipped at the 16. USC was able 
to call a timeout, its second, with three seconds left, allowing Quin Rodriquez 
to kick a 34-yard field goal on the last play of the half. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the fact that Griffin slipped undoubtedly saved the Trojans. 
Through classic mismanagement of the clock, they had put themselves in a 
situation where, had he continued toward the end zone, he probably would have 
been tackled short of the goal with time elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans had thoroughly dominated the first quarter, consuming nearly five 
minutes with an opening drive that ended when Marinovich threw an interception 
at Michigan's 33. Later in the quarter, Rodriquez missed a 32-yard field goal 
that appeared to barely float over -- and wide of -- the left upright. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, defensive guard Dan Owens broke through and blocked a 
punt by Michigan's Chris Stapleton. The ball was picked up by USC's Junior 
Seau, who returned it 24 yards to the Wolverine 11. 
</P>
<P>
But even then, it took the Trojans six plays to finally get the ball into the 
end zone, and when they did, it appeared that luck, once again, was involved. 
</P>
<P>
After USC gained a first down on fourth and inches from the two -- by inches on 
a sneak by Marinovich -- the quarterback set his team up, second and inches shy 
of the goal. He went to hand off to fullback Leroy Holt, but kept the ball 
instead and slipped over left tackle, into the end zone. The play appeared to 
be a broken handoff, because when Marinovich turned to head toward the end 
zone, he looked confused. 
</P>
<P>
With Rodriquez's kick, the score was 7-0, and Michigan had done little. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after USC passed up a possible 45-yard field goal attempt for a 
fourth-and-ten incompletion, Wolverine running back Leroy Hoard finally got 
untracked. Hoard started right and cut back over the middle for a 46-yard gain 
that set up an eventual 20-yard field goal by Michigan with 6:30 left in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
But before J.D. Carlson put up the three points for the Wolverines, Michigan 
Coach Bo Schembechler called a halfback option pass and a quarterback draw from 
the five. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard finished the half with 86 yards rushing, significant in that the best 
full game this season against the Trojans was Tony Rice's 99 yards for Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan managed only three first downs in the half, to 10 for USC, and the 
Wolverines were outgained, 239 yards to 127. Marinovich threw 26 times and 
completed 18 for 129 yards, that for a school that used to throw that many 
times in, say, the first four games of its season. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Hoard -- the most valuable player in the Wolverine's 22-14 
victory over USC in the 1989 Rose Bowl -- really started to get into the flow. 
The 220-pound junior from New Orleans, who scored two late touchdowns in last 
year's Rose Bowl in rushing for 142 yards against the Trojans, set up the 
Wolverines' tying touchdown with a 31-yard run midway through the period. 
</P>
<P>
As he did in his breakaway in the first half, Hoard used dazzling open-field 
moves to put Michigan in position for Allen Jefferson's two-yard scoring run 
with 4:05 to play in the third quarter that made the score 10-10.

DESPITE LOSS, BO WON'T GO OUT LIKE A LAMB

<P>
It would have been a shame for Bo Schembechler's career to end in a tie. A tie 
is -- what? A dance with your sister, a kiss from a French general, a card game 
with your aunt? A title fight shouldn't end in a draw, a war shouldn't end in a 
stalemate at Panmunjom. A great career shouldn't end in a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Golfers don't lay up in U.S. Opens, cleanup hitters don't bunt in the World 
Series, tennis players don't send up lobs in the fifth set at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
And Bo Schembechler didn't fall on the ball in the 76th Rose Bowl Monday. He 
went out with his guns out, his boots on. He didn't say "I'll play these." He 
faded the shooter. He wanted to go out the way he came in -- breathing 
defiance, daring the tiger, knocking the chip off the shoulder of the bully. 
His way. 
</P>
<P>
So, Bo didn't go out with a whimper. His team didn't tie one for the old Bo. Bo 
didn't even punt. Bo didn't just call. Bo bumped the pot, didn't stand on any 
18. He went for the pin. 
</P>
<P>
So, he didn't go out with a any chicken-salad tie. He went out a loser. 
</P>
<P>
The situation was this: Bo's Michigan team had somehow managed to tie the 
score, 10-10. No one knows how. USC was faster, deeper and, on the whole, 
niftier, than Bo's team. But they kept shooting themselves in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with about 7:30 to play, the situation was this: Bo's team had the ball on 
its 46-yard line, fourth down and two to go. You punt in that situation. Even 
if you're behind. Tied, you punt for certain. 
</P>
<P>
Bo didn't. His punter took the ball and set sail around left end for 24 yards 
to USC's 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
There goes the old ballgame, right? I mean, from there Michigan goes in to 
score, chewing up the clock as it goes. A game-winning call has just been made. 
A field goal at least, right? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you have to understand Bo and the Rose Bowl. What the famine was to Job, 
the plague to Joseph, the Rose Bowl was to Bo -- a hoodoo. A cross to bear. 
</P>
<P>
Bo's first Rose Bowl game, he had a heart attack. And the situation went 
downhill from there. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a game, it was a jinx. Bo lost two Rose Bowl games because enemy 
teams failed to punt on fourth down in their own territory. Stanford did it to 
him in 1972. Washington did it in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
So, Bo finally turned the tables? Guess again. As the play is finished, this 
little yellow handkerchief comes fluttering out on the field. Play nullified. 
Victory nullified. Ten-yard penalty. Bo is entitled to say, "Me again, huh, 
God?" 
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines, Bo goes quietly crazy. He swells up with rage, charges the 
official. He is berserk. 
</P>
<P>
Bad Bo. Fifteen-yard penalty. Move the ball back to the Michigan 21. 
</P>
<P>
Now, punt. Now, fold the hand. Take back the blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
That was the pivotal part of the game. Bottom line: Bo loses again. He's 2-8 in 
the Rose Bowl. This is a coach who is 194-47-5 at Michigan. He was good enough 
to come to 10 Rose Bowls. He always showed up with a smart, well-drilled, 
resourceful, take-no-prisoners, coal yard type of football team. 
Over-achievers, really. 
</P>
<P>
He may have cost his team this Rose Bowl. The resultant punt, after Bo's 
tantrum and penalty, from the 21 is barely adequate. USC is in position to 
mount a closing drive that produced a touchdown with 1:10 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
The betting in the press interview room is even-money whether Bo will show up 
after this dismal loss. His mentor, the late Woody Hayes, would have stayed in 
the bunker and licked his wounds and cursed the Fates -- to say nothing of the 
refs. 
</P>
<P>
If he does show up, the betting is 1-to-5 he'll be coming into the room like a 
crashing plane. Aflame and spewing destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Bo is smiling as he enters the room. He is leaving the Rose Bowl as he entered 
it -- a loser. 
</P>
<P>
Only he doesn't act like one. Bo is downright jovial. His team is sobbing in 
the dressing room, he admits, but Bo is still full of fight. Bo doesn't cry. Bo 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
It is reminiscent of the time Joe Louis lay in a locker room after being 
knocked out by Rocky Marciano. Around him, people are tearing their hair, 
ripping their garments, crying out to the heavens. Louis opened an eye, looked 
up. "Hey!" he protested. "I knocked out lots of guys!" 
</P>
<P>
Bo didn't go out crying. He knocked out lots of guys, too. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't forgive the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all," he said, "we didn't deserve to win the game. We were miserable 
in the first half. I don't think we played well all day. It surprised me we 
gave up so many yards. Was SC faster than us? Well, we didn't think so going 
in." 
</P>
<P>
The call that cost him all chance at the 1990 Rose Bowl game was not so 
charitably viewed by Bo. "Most unbelievable call," Bo said, shaking his head. 
But he was smiling as he said it. "It was the most ridiculous call ever and, if 
I see the films and decide it was justified, I will be glad to retract. Was it 
a Pac-10 official? Naturally! But I will say that the worst call ever made on 
me here was by a Big Ten official once. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, one guy said it was called because of blocking below the waist. Another 
said it was old-fashioned holding. I'll guarantee you it was a late call. 
</P>
<P>
"Will they take it up with the supervisory officials? Listen, I want you to 
know, in the history of the game, according to supervisory officials, there has 
never been a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know what my humble opinion is? My humble opinion is that the game 
has passed up (the capabilities) of all amateur officials. It's too fast, it's 
too complex. It should have competent, professional officials." 
</P>
<P>
So, the Rose Bowl is not going to have Bo Schembechler to kick around any more. 
It's probably fitting he went out the way he came in. The Rose Bowl remained 
his bete noire to the end, the cloud over his head, his personal hex. 
</P>
<P>
Bo never got the hang of it. He never lost by more than a touchdown except once 
when he lost by 10 points -- to UCLA in '83. He never flinched, got reckless, 
or even played the game of a desperate man. The Rose Bowl always knew it was in 
a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Bo could beat Ohio State, Bo could win Big Ten titles, Bo could even beat Notre 
Dame if it came to that. Bo was just overmatched by a hex, not a team. 
Actually, he almost beat USC -- and the hex -- Monday. He took his shot. The 
Rose Bowl just got on its broom and flew away, cackling. The old bawd never 
gave Bo an honest cut of the cards. 
</P>
<P>
Bo will miss the Rose Bowl. But not as much as the Rose Bowl will miss Bo.

ORANGE BOWL: NOTRE DAME DODGES FIRST-HALF BULLETS, THEN SHOOTS A ROCKET AT 
PREVIOUSLY UNBEATEN COLORADO, 21-6. HOLTZ SAYS IRISH SHOULD BE NO. 1.

MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A campaign began, a dream ended Monday night as Notre Dame defeated Colorado, 
21-6, in an Orange Bowl game that sent shivers down the national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado began the night as No. 1, but didn't end it there. Notre Dame, ranked 
fourth -- for now -- saw to that as it granted the Buffaloes three first-half 
scoring wishes and survived to tell about it. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the Irish unleashed Raghib (The Rocket) Ismail, their little 
speedburner of a tailback, who left powder burns on a stunned CU defense and 
caused a packed house of 81,191 to shake their heads in admiration. His 110 
rushing yards, 83 of them in the second half, helped break open a game that was 
0-0 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Ismail was presented with the most valuable player award and 
a miniature Orange Bowl trophy, which he carried as easily as he toted the 
Irish offense Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail scored once in the third quarter, on a 35-yard reverse, and fullback 
Anthony Johnson added two other short touchdown runs to give Notre Dame a 
victory in a place that has haunted them for years. At last, the Irish left 
this aging stadium with a win, their first in their last six tries. 
</P>
<P>
And if you can believe Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, the Irish also left with 
another national championship, which would be their second in as many seasons. 
According to Holtz, Notre Dame's convincing victory over Colorado negated 
anything that happened between Miami and Alabama at the Sugar Bowl. To make his 
point, Holtz delivered a stern sermon to the assembled press, some of whom will 
cast ballots for the Associated Press final poll. 
</P>
<P>
"I can honestly say right now that we got the best record and the toughest 
schedule," Holtz said. "And I don't know how you can decide on anyone else 
being No. 1. Now that's my personal opinion. Unless you want to say, 'Who was 
the best team on Nov. 25?' (the night Notre Dame lost to Miami and lost its No. 
1 ranking). We did not play well, we came off an emotional victory at Penn 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"But we played the toughest schedule and had the best record and we were No. 1 
for 11 weeks. The one week we're out of No. 1, we come back and beat No. 1 by 
15 points." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz's voice took on a frosty edge, as if he wanted all to know precisely how 
he felt about the poll war that will be waged between Notre Dame and Miami 
until the rankings are made public today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to campaign or anything like that, but I just believe in my 
heart that if you have the best record against the toughest schedule . . . case 
rest." 
</P>
<P>
As if Holtz wasn't forceful enough, quarterback Tony Rice offered his postgame 
assessment of the voting process. 
</P>
<P>
"We have played 13 games and won 12 of them," he said. "We beat the undefeated, 
No. 1 team. We deserve to be No. 1. We better be No. 1!" 
</P>
<P>
It is a situation filled with ironies. In a way, Notre Dame, playing in the 
stadium used by the Hurricanes, might have helped Miami's cause more than its 
own. Maybe that's why Miami offered the Irish use of its practice facilities 
and locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Should Notre Dame squeeze past Miami in the final rankings, it can thank the 
Irish defense for confounding a Buffalo offense used to scoring early and 
often. Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan completed just four of 13 passes, 
which tended to diminish the importance of his 116 rushing yards and one 
scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt very confident in the huddle, but unfortunately, we'd get it down 
close and couldn't punch it in," Hagan said. "It wasn't frustrating at first, 
but in the second half we didn't play with as much intensity. They went up, 
14-0, and we wanted to show we weren't going to lie down. But we didn't come up 
with enough points." 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if they didn't have their chances. The Buffaloes will forever 
remember the first half and what might have been. And if they don't, someone 
ought to remind them. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of quarters came and went and with it, at least three Colorado scoring 
opportunities, maybe four if you count Notre Dame's Tony Rice nearly being 
tackled for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado's offense wasn't choosy with its mistakes. It fumbled away a sure 
touchdown, missed a chip-shot field goal, failed three times from the Notre 
Dame one-yard line and then botched a questionable fake field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Three times inside the Notre Dame 20. Zero points. 
</P>
<P>
The Colorado offensive line couldn't be faulted. So wide were the running lanes 
in the first half that Ralphie, the buffalo mascot, could have dashed through 
untouched. Instead, tailback Eric Bieniemy, back in the lineup after missing 
half of the season with a broken leg, and Hagan did the honors on the 
Buffaloes' first failed scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
Down the field Colorado went until, with a second-and-five from the Irish 35, 
Bieniemy burst through the line on what appeared to be a clear path to the end 
zone. About halfway there, Bieniemy tried switching the ball from his left to 
right hand . . . and dropped it. Notre Dame recovered. 
</P>
<P>
One possession later, after using 11 plays to move to the Notre Dame five-yard 
line, Colorado kicker Ken Culbertson jogged onto the field for a 23-yard field 
goal attempt. Moments later, his skulled attempt barely cleared the line before 
swerving far left of the upright. 
</P>
<P>
Gone were three more points. 
</P>
<P>
The frustration didn't end with Culbertson's shank. Colorado got the ball back, 
promptly drove to the Irish one-yard line, where the Buffaloes failed three 
consecutive times to squirm into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
On fourth-and-three, Culbertson returned for a 20-yard attempt. Ram Coach John 
Robinson can empathize with what happened next. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than let Culbertson kick away, the Buffaloes had holder Jeff Campbell 
try for a touchdown. Campbell took the snap, looked for a receiver and then 
dashed for the right corner of the end zone. It would have been a fine play had 
Notre Dame defensive tackle Troy Ridgely not been waiting for him at the two. 
</P>
<P>
Poof went another three points, six if Colorado had been able to punch it in 
from the one. 
</P>
<P>
So what could have been perhaps a 17-point halftime lead, became a series of 
calamities that ultimately took their toll on the Buffaloes. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming away from the first half without any points, after controlling the game 
for a while, was too much to overcome," Colorado Coach Bill McCartney said. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame had only one scoring opportunity in the first half and also blew it. 
After a series of timeouts, Bill Hackett's 27-yard field goal was blocked, 
ending two quarters of frustration.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE'S NOT A QUARTERBACK SINCE TEAM PUT QUARTER IN THE RACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former USC quarterback Sean Salisbury might be the first pro football player to 
be cut because of a quote in a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury led the Winnipeg Blue Bombers to the 1988 Grey Cup championship, and 
then, in 16 games this season, passed for 26 touchdowns, including six in one 
game, and nearly 4,100 yards. But he was cut with one week left in the Canadian 
Football League's regular season. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Bombers, it seems, were upset about a quote that appeared in the Times 
Oct. 25. It was included in a story that said Salisbury, who was in the midst 
of the contract dispute with the team, could become the biggest sports star in 
Winnipeg if he would commit to a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury was quoted: "That I would love to stay in Winnipeg is . . . a little 
far-fetched. I tell the people that in the media here so they'll get off my 
back. But I'd love to stay?" 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury was benched in the second quarter of the next game and was cut the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know whether to laugh or cry," said Salisbury, who is living in 
Denver. "There was nothing wrong with the article, and I knew they (Blue Bomber 
executives) would probably see it. The whole thing turned into a debacle. It 
was a nightmare. I thought I'd never wake up." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Salisbury has found a silver lining. "It turned out to be a 
blessing," he said. "Now I'm a free agent and can get an early start shopping 
my services to the NFL. There's already been some interest." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Jan. 2, 1961, who passed for three touchdowns and kicked a 
field goal and the extra points to give the Houston Oilers a 24-16 victory over 
the then-Los Angeles Chargers in the first American Football League 
championship game? 
</P>
<P>
Out of the kitchen: Jerry Reynolds, promoted to the front office of the 
Sacramento Kings, says he finally realized he was too thin-skinned to be an NBA 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds told the Sacramento Bee Saturday that he was listening to a sports 
talk show while driving home after a game when a fan called to criticize the 
coach for misusing his timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"He was saying I had called a dumb timeout," Reynolds said. "He didn't even 
know that the timeout in question was a mandatory one. The refs called it, not 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought to myself, 'Why, you dumb s.o.b.! And that's the kind of thing I 
have to get used to?' I knew I'd never get used to that. 
</P>
<P>
"Some coaches can take it, but they're wired different than me. They're 
hard-shelled. The bad doesn't affect them like it does me. That's the kind of 
guy we're looking for to replace me." 
</P>
<P>
Waxing successful: John Randall, 39, a mail handler at the U.S. Postal 
Service's main station in Portland, had a winning 14-game ticket in Oregon's 
NFL lottery last week -- his second in seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"People call me 'Hot Candle' Randall," he said, "and when I'm hot, I'm really 
hot." 
</P>
<P>
Randall was one of three who won $15,165.80 last week. His other winner was 
worth $12,560. 
</P>
<P>
His secret? 
</P>
<P>
"I can read between the lines on the statistics, and I've followed certain 
players since they were in college," Randall said. "I know which ones are 
winners and which ones are losers." 
</P>
<P>
Randall said he is eager to play Oregon's NBA lottery beginning this week. "The 
ball in basketball is round," he said, "and the game should have a little more 
consistency than football." 
</P>
<P>
Perfectly clear: Pete Arbogast, the KNX radio announcer for Saturday's 
USC-Northern Arizona basketball game, on Trojan reserve Josh Oppenheimer: 
</P>
<P>
"He's from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks. There's a Notre Dame High 
School in Riverside. That's why you've got the different pronunciations." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: George Blanda.

HE WAS A TOWER OF POWER ON USC'S WINNING DRIVE; 
</P>
<P>
MVP: RICKY ERVINS, WHO CARRIED THE FOOTBALL 30 TIMES FOR 126 YARDS, SAYS THE 
TROJANS WORE DOWN THE WOLVERINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When USC needed a big play on the ground, they ran a simple off-tackle blast 
with tailback Ricky Ervins carrying the ball behind the blocking of fullback 
Leroy Holt. 
</P>
<P>
In the Trojans' playbook, the play is called "86," which calls for quarterback 
Todd Marinovich to roll outside his strongside tackle and hand off to Ervins. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing fancy, just power football. But against Michigan in Monday's Rose Bowl 
game, it was a play that buried the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
With a first down on Michigan's 14-yard line with 1:21 remaining, the Trojans 
again called on Ervins. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be the last time they would need the Rose Bowl game MVP. 
Behind Holt and pulling strongside guard Mark Tucker, Ervins powered into the 
Wolverines' secondary and received a key block from Gary Wellman. He ran over 
Michigan All-American safety Tripp Welborne at the seven-yard line and 
high-stepped into the end zone, ending USC's two-game losing streak in the Rose 
Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
"All game long, they couldn't stop it," Ervins said about the "86" play. "We 
just wore them down at the end." 
</P>
<P>
On the final drive, USC needed 11 plays to travel 75 yards, but after reaching 
Michigan's 24-yard line, the Trojans were content to keep the ball on the 
ground to set up a game-winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
But in the huddle before Ervins' touchdown, the Trojans were confident that 
they could score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd came into the huddle and told us that we are going to score on this 
play," Ervins said. "All I said was, 'Oh really?' " 
</P>
<P>
What made Marinovich so sure of his prediction was the Trojans' previous 
blocking success with the play. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the play) worked all day," Marinovich said. "I told the line to stay on 
their blocks a little longer and he (Ervins) will score, just like he did." 
</P>
<P>
With All-Pacific 10 tight end Scott Galbraith helping senior tackle Bill 
Schultz on a double-team block of Michigan defensive tackle Sylvester Stanley, 
the Trojans were able to open a hole for Holt and Tucker to clear for Ervins. 
</P>
<P>
"We were this close from breaking it every time we had ran it," Galbraith said, 
holding his thumb and index finger an inch apart. "Their defensive line was big 
and strong, but I was surprised that they were so blockable." 
</P>
<P>
USC quarterback coach Ray Dorr, who did most of the play calling from the press 
box, said that Coach Larry Smith called for the winning play. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Smith said that he wanted to run the ball off-tackle to run off some of 
the clock," Dorr said. "When I heard he had made the call, I said 'Great.' It 
wasn't a hard call." 
</P>
<P>
USC did not use the play until its sixth game against California. 
</P>
<P>
"The play has always worked for us," Tucker said. "And today, we knew that 
Ricky was close to breaking it into the end zone every time we ran it. 
</P>
<P>
"They never made any kind of adjustments and they never were able to stop it. 
When I pull around like that, it becomes like a sweep for me." 
</P>
<P>
Ervins, a junior, began the season as third-string tailback. On his first "86" 
carry, Ervins gained 12 yards. He carried 30 times for 126 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive line was blocking great all game," Ervins said, who used to work 
as a Rose Bowl parking attendant when he played at Pasadena Muir High. "Early 
in the game I was not hitting the right holes, but they where there. It was 
just up to me to make the runs." 
</P>
<P>
It was Ervins' eighth 100-yard rushing game of the season and he finished with 
1,395 yards, 12th in school history. He joins Charles White (1979 and 1980), 
Sam Cunningham (1973), O.J. Simpson (1968) and Erny Pinckett (1932) as Trojan 
running backs named Rose Bowl game MVP.

TELEVISION: A HARD DAY'S NIGHT OF FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, there can be too much football. 
</P>
<P>
There was some good football on New Year's Day -- particularly for USC, Notre 
Dame and Miami fans -- but seven games in one day is about four too many. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL presents a nice, neat postseason tournament, culminating with Super 
Bowl Sunday. What the colleges present is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
Watching seven games within an 11-hour span is enough to make your head spin 
more than a New Year's Day hangover. 
</P>
<P>
The first game Monday was the Hall of Fame Bowl, which began shortly after 10 
a.m. The last one, the Sugar Bowl, didn't end until 9:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
ABC made the most of its late sign-off and asked viewers to call in their votes 
for the No. 1 team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
At last count, Notre Dame had a pretty healthy lead over Miami, 55% to 26%, 
after 50,000 calls. 
</P>
<P>
NBC and ABC each televised three games and CBS one. 
</P>
<P>
NBC got a head start on ABC with the Hall of Fame Bowl starting a half-hour 
earlier than the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
NBC had to cut away from its coverage of the Rose Parade a little early, but at 
least it didn't run into the overlapping problems later in the day that ABC 
did. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's Hall of Fame Bowl ended at 1:27 p.m. and the network wasted little time 
switching to the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It was a far better switch than ABC's from the Citrus Bowl to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
ABC planned to be on the air from Pasadena at 1:45 p.m., and the kickoff was 
scheduled for shortly after 2. 
</P>
<P>
But, as things turned out, the kickoff was delayed until 2:21. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the delay was that the Citrus Bowl didn't end until 2:03. 
Then, making matters worse, ABC took its time making the switch, to say the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
After the Citrus Bowl was over, ABC showed a promotional spot for the upcoming 
Rose Bowl. Thanks, but we knew it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a promo for ABC Sports, then a "thank you" promotional spot to an 
airline that provides free air travel. 
</P>
<P>
There were two promos for ABC shows, followed by a news brief. 
</P>
<P>
It was almost 2:10. 
</P>
<P>
What next? Three consecutive commercials and a Channel 7 promo for Todd 
Donoho's "New Year's Live" postgame show. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Donoho's show wasn't bad. He played it pretty straight, and his 
look-a-likes segment was interesting. John Robinson and Duke Snider was one of 
his best. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, ABC was still a long way from the Rose Bowl kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
After some ABC Sports graphics, there was a Big Ten promo, then more graphics 
and finally a glimpse of the Rose Bowl, where the crowd was completing the 
national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Then came an intro from announcer Keith Jackson and another taped piece on 
Schembechler, this one showing a 1971 pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
Next was another commercial, then a Pacific 10 promo followed by one more 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:16, the teams took the field, and Jackson and commentator Bob Griese 
offered a little pregame analysis. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl kickoff came 18 minutes after the end of the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
ABC had met with Rose Bowl officials at about 1 p.m. and asked for a later 
kickoff, so the teams knew what was coming. 
</P>
<P>
But it was unnerving to viewers at home and fans at the game, making them wait 
and wait. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-minute break wouldn't have been so bad had ABC not crammed in all those 
commercials and promos. 
</P>
<P>
There were 20 minutes between the Fiesta Bowl and Orange Bowl on NBC, but that 
network used the time mostly for analysis and features. 
</P>
<P>
It used the time for only a few commercials and promos. 
</P>
<P>
ABC producer Bob Goodrich, who was in charge of the Rose Bowl coverage, had 
plenty of material planned for his pregame show, but someone higher up at ABC 
decided against using it. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Goodrich, director Larry Kamm, announcers Jackson and Griese and the 
rest of the ABC crew put out an excellent Rose Bowl telecast -- once it got 
going. 
</P>
<P>
ABC got some definitive shots the holding call on Michigan's fake punt in the 
fourth quarter, but the most conclusive shot wasn't shown until halftime of the 
Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It showed that Michigan's Bobby Abrams held, but it was far away from the play 
and the flag was late. 
</P>
<P>
Usually sideline reporters offer little, but NBC's O.J. Simpson came up with 
some good information during the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, working the Colorado sideline while Ralph Wiley handled the Notre Dame 
bench, explained why the entire teams of both schools went on the field before 
the kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said when the Colorado players saw the whole Notre Dame team coming 
out, they did the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson also explained what went wrong on Colorado's fake field goal try early 
in the game, pointing out that the key receiver forgot to run a pattern. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange Bowl booth, Dick Enberg and Bill Walsh had one of their best 
games. It was refreshing to hear how excited Walsh was. 
</P>
<P>
He even apologized for a profanity. Actually, all he said was 'that was a 
helluva play." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers of the Hall of Fame Bowl saw one of the all-time hits when Ohio State's 
Zack Dumas leveled Auburn's Stacy Danley. 
</P>
<P>
Announcer Don Criqui first said: "That's got to be the hardest hit of the 
'89-90 bowl season." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after viewing a replay, Criqui said: "It's the hardest hit I've seen in 
football in years." 
</P>
<P>
Criqui at one point forgot he was at the Hall of Fame Bowl. Talking about 
Auburn's Shayne Wasden's punt returns of 30 and 34 yards, he said they broke 
the Orange Bowl record. 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe you can't blame Criqui for being confused. He worked the last eight 
Orange Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of flubs, Simpson, during halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl, referred 
to Notre Dame's George Gipp as George Kemp. However, Simpson did catch the 
mistake and corrected it. 
</P>
<P>
In referring to Gipp's death, comparing it to the death of Colorado quarterback 
Sal Aunese, Simpson said it occurred a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Colleague Bob Costas, fearing Simpson's attempt at sarcasm was probably lost on 
most viewers, added: "It was more than a few years ago. It was so long ago that 
a young Ronald Reagan could play Gipp (in the 1940 movie, 'Knute Rockne -- All 
American')." 
</P>
<P>
During halftime of the Fiesta Bowl, Gayle Gardner -- yes, she still works for 
NBC -- had an excellent feature on the once-troubled Colorado football program 
and the death of Aunese last September. 
</P>
<P>
CBS deserves kudos for the halftime piece it showed during the Cotton Bowl. It 
chronicled the highlights of college football during the 1980s, including 
California's 1982 kickoff against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
NBC broke a story Monday afternoon that Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry 
Alvarez would be leaving the school to become head coach at Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
The network had Wiley interview Alvarez later in the day, but because of 
technical problems, had to cut away from it earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
On this day and night of football, the coverage and the announcing, overall, 
was fine. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that something needs to be done about the logjam. The way things are 
now, it's impossible to see everything. 
</P>
<P>
And that's depriving viewers. You don't see the NFL scheduling seven games on 
Super Bowl Sunday.

MARINOVICH GOES FROM A COLT TO A TROJAN HORSE; 
</P>
<P>
QUARTERBACK: THERE WERE A LOT OF DOUBTERS WHEN THE SEASON STARTED, BUT NEARLY 
EVERYBODY BELIEVES IN HIS TALENT NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For just a moment, between the waves of reporters coming at him to ask 
questions, the tall red-haired player with the cocksure smile looked around and 
studied all that had become his domain. 
</P>
<P>
It was only a messy locker room, strewn with everything from shoes and socks to 
supporters, both the elastic and human kind. 
</P>
<P>
But to the young man named Marinovich, age 20 going on 45, it was everything 
that boyhood dreams are made of. All around him, fellow USC football players, 
most of them older and most of them doubters when he first came on the scene, 
sang his praises. Reporters not only asked him about him; they asked them about 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The phrase "born leader" came from one of his receivers, junior Frank Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Another receiver, senior John Jackson, called him "my right-hand man, even if 
he is left-handed." 
</P>
<P>
Yet another, the team's leader in spirit and machismo, senior All-American Tim 
Ryan, a defensive tackle, called him "precocious" and added that he "has become 
a great player and a great friend of mine." 
</P>
<P>
So it was at the Rose Bowl Monday for Todd Marinovich, the freshman quarterback 
from Capistrano Valley. In one of the toughest situations in sport, the 
pressure of the closing minutes of a tied Rose Bowl game, Marinovich had 
delivered. 
</P>
<P>
He had taken his Trojans on a late drive, had set up the winning touchdown with 
a key third-down pass to his buddy, Jackson, and had called the winning 
touchdown play, an off-tackle blast by Ricky Ervins, like he was Bobby Layne 
with a full-week's growth of beard. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd said we'd run 86 off right tackle," Ervins said. "He said it would work, 
that it would go all the way. I said, 'Oh, really.' He said it would go. Next 
thing, I just walked into the end zone." Marinovich's version was similar, yet 
more understated. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told the linemen to stay on their blocks a bit longer on this one, that 
it'd go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And said like a true veteran, a guy with 20 games or so under his belt. He 
didn't spit on the floor when he said it, but he could have. 
</P>
<P>
So much has happened to Marinovich since Pat O'Hara went down with a knee 
injury scant days before USC was to open against Illinois; since he fairly well 
stunk out the joint against the Fighting Illini and had his older, grizzled 
teammates beseeching the heavens for an alternative to this local kid with 
mouth to match press clippings. 
</P>
<P>
Just six months after his 20th birthday, he had completed 197 passes for 2,400 
yards and 16 touchdowns, had led the Trojans to an 8-2-1 record, a Pac-10 title 
and had led his team into the Rose Bowl. The doubters were now believers. 
</P>
<P>
And after passing for 178 yards, rushing for 35 more and engineering the late 
75-yard scoring drive that ended Bo Schembechler's career with a boo, 
Marinovich had truly come of age. The colt had become a real Trojan horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't ask for anything more from him," said Jackson, who caught five 
passes for 56 yards, ended the season with 62 and established a Pac-10 record 
with a reception in his 37th consecutive game Monday. "As a receiver, your MVP 
has to be the quarterback. When he took over at the beginning of the year, we 
were all worried. But he worked with me, we kept at it, and I can say now that 
Todd has had more to do than anybody with my career blossoming like it has." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the game's key connection was Marinovich to Jackson with just over two 
minutes left. It was third down and five at Michigan's 44, and this drive was 
going to be it for the Trojans. Do or be tied. Marinovich went back, found 
Jackson in the middle of the field, and USC was suddenly looking very rosy at 
the Wolverine 24. Four plays later, it was 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm supposed to be reading on that play, looking over everybody," Marinovich 
said. "But the truth is, I just looked at John, watched him all the way. And 
there he was." 
</P>
<P>
To Jackson, it was equally simple. 
</P>
<P>
"Surprisingly, that was the only time all day that we called that play," he 
said. "I noticed their linebackers weren't getting back far enough, and they 
didn't on that play, so I just curled into a spot and the ball was there, just 
like it always is." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson wasn't surprised. A story about the first Marinovich-to-Jackson 
connection explained why. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't like me to tell this, but he said it's OK today, and we still kid 
about it a lot," Jackson said, recalling a scenario with Marinovich that goes 
back to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a senior at Bishop Amat High School," Jackson said. "He was at Mater 
Dei, before he transferred to Capistrano Valley. Even back then, when he was 
really just a kid, he was the whole show. Our whole defense was geared for him. 
They sent four guys out for passes on every play. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, this night, I catch three touchdown passes and we win, 28-8. But the 
thing I remembered more than anything else is that I played defense, too, back 
then and I made a pick (interception) against him. I think that was an omen. 
That was 60-some receptions ago, the start of a real good hookup." 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of Jackson's story, Marinovich walked past, smiled and said, "He 
was just lucky that night." 
</P>
<P>
Then he swaggered off into the night, looking part Ken Stabler and part Clint 
Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson watched him leave, sighed, and said, "I wish I had a couple of years of 
eligibility left."

SCHEMBECHLER GOES OUT IN (HIS) STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
COACH: BO THROWS A FIT IN HIS FINAL GAME ON SIDELINES, THEN BERATES OFFICIALS 
IN HIS FINAL POSTGAME INTERVIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It seems only fitting that Bo Schembechler bowed out of coaching on what he 
perceived as an unbelievable call by an official. 
</P>
<P>
And, it occurred, of course, at the Rose Bowl, where Bo has been been burned so 
often in the past, either by an official or an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler said his team didn't deserve to beat USC Monday in the 76th Rose 
Bowl game and it didn't, losing, 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he was emphatic that a holding call assessed against his team on a 
successful run on a fake punt in the fourth quarter should not have been made. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the end of it, either. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler seemingly risked another heart attack as he fumed on the 
sidelines. He threw down his clipboard, got tangled in the wires of his headset 
and almost fell. And he was cited for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 10-10, when Chris Stapleton went back in punt formation on 
fourth-and-two from the Michigan 46-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Stapleton fooled USC's defenders and took off around left end for 24 yards. But 
the big play was nullified. Michigan linebacker Bobby Abrams was the apparent 
offender as he was called for holding on the play. 
</P>
<P>
That was a 10-yard penalty. Then Schembechler, storming on the sidelines, drew 
another 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct as he screamed at the officials. 
</P>
<P>
So Michigan had to punt again, losing field position, and the Trojans then 
drove 75 yards to the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I won't miss in retirement is incompetent officials," 
Schembechler said. "It's the most unbelievable call I've ever seen and I got it 
in my last game. " 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler had already announced his retirement as Michigan's coach a few 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler said that Abrams shoved an unidentified USC player which, in his 
opinion, was perfectly legal. 
</P>
<P>
"The call the guy (line judge Charles Czubin) made to me was blocking below the 
waist," Schembechler said. "Then, they tell me he went on to the referee (Jim 
Kemerling) and said it was a holding call." 
</P>
<P>
When asked which official threw the flag, Schembechler brightened and said: 
</P>
<P>
"The most incompetent one. The call was ridiculous. If I see the film I'll 
retract it. But every indication I had from people in the press box (his 
coaches) and people who saw it on television was that it was a ridiculous call. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it was fate because we played so poorly that the Lord wanted the right 
team to win." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler said he was aware that the call was made by a Pac-10 official. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I do know that. And it happens every time. One of the things they should 
do in this game, in my judgment, is to have a neutral crew. 
</P>
<P>
"This business of split crews doesn't work out. Don't get me wrong. The worst 
call I've ever had was by a Big Ten official out here. But this one ranks." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler was referring to USC tailback Charles White's phantom touchdown in 
the 1979 Rose Bowl game. White was credited with a touchdown even though 
television instant replay clearly showed that he lost the ball on the 
three-yard line on his dive into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I was angry because I knew it was a bad call," Schembechler said, 
referring again to the holding on the fake punt. "You'd be angry, too. We had a 
shot at that time." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clearly evident on instant replay whether Abrams was guilty of 
holding. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams said he didn't hold and didn't know that he was the culprit until 
informed by some of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
USC linebacker Bruce Luizzi, who was defending as an end on the play, said that 
he was definitely held, but he insisted that Michigan safety Tripp Welborne 
committed the infraction. "I said, 'He's holding me, he's holding me,' and the 
official dropped the flag," Luizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked Schembechler if he contributed to his team's defeat with his 
unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"I contributed greatly," Bo acknowledged, "but the call shouldn't have been 
thrown on me. He (the referee) backed up his buddy." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler made it clear, though, that Michigan didn't deserve to win. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't seem to get anything going," he said. "I'm surprised our defense 
gave up so much yardage. We were fortunate to be only seven down at halftime." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler didn't want to detract from USC, though, saying the Trojans 
deserved to win and were the best team Michigan has met other than Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler wasn't through berating the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The game has passed up almost all amateur officials. The game is too fast, too 
complicated. They don't have enough training. They're not pros. They have other 
jobs. So you will get those things. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't go out and find another official to make that call." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Schembechler became sentimental. He is leaving Michigan as head coach 
after 21 years, but he'll remain as athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was the last time. I'll be in sports again," he said. "I won't be on 
the field ever. I'm no longer a field coach. I'll be in the background 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always be a Michigan man. Michigan is my school." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Rose Bowl, where he said goodby with a 2-8 record and some 
questionable calls by his reckoning, the historic stadium won't be prominent in 
his memoirs.

SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
AKINEMOD MIGHT NOT KNOW IT, BUT SHE MIGHT BE QUITE A FILLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With her easy victory Monday in the $107,650 La Brea Breeders' Cup Stakes at 
Santa Anita, Akinemod ran her win streak to five, the only blemish on her 
record coming when she was a troubled fourth in her debut last April. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a filly who still hasn't figured out exactly what she's supposed to 
be doing for a living. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a big game to her," said Gary Stevens after steering the Time To 
Explode filly to a two-length win over Fantastic Look. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel she knows what she's doing. I still feel there's room for 
improvement." 
</P>
<P>
This would be disheartening news to those who chased her home Monday. After 
battling with Pat Copelan and Linda Card through a :22 and :44 1/5 half, she 
opened up by 2 1/2 lengths about a furlong from the finish. Fantastic Look, the 
beneficiary of a perfect trip and who looked dangerous around the turn, could 
make no impact late. 
</P>
<P>
Covering the seven furlongs in 1:21 3/5, the 6-5 favorite earned herself a 
start in the middle leg of the La Canada series, the El Encino Stakes Jan. 15. 
That would mark her initial venture around two turns, and among her likely 
opponents is Breeders' Cup Distaff runner-up Gorgeous. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how far she wants to go, but we'll run her in the next one and 
see," said Jerry Fanning, who trains Akinemod for owner Jack Klugman. "I wasn't 
so much worried about the speed in the race as when I saw (Fantastic Look) 
coming up so fast. 
</P>
<P>
"But Akinemod just kept running. She finished well and she's just a good 
filly." 
</P>
<P>
Although she had never bled in a race, Akinemod did so in her Dec. 22 work and 
that's why she ran with Lasix Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We scoped her and it kind of worried us a little," Fanning said. "We gave her 
Lasix for her next work (Dec. 28) and if she hadn't worked well with it, we 
wouldn't have run her with Lasix." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who has ridden her in half of her lifetime starts, thinks Akinemod 
will handle a distance of ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel it's going to be any problem," he said. "She galloped out real 
strong and I didn't get her pulled up until the middle of the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
"She's real relaxed early and she's not speed crazy. She relaxed well today 
with a horse inside (Linda Card) of her and a horse (Pat Copelan) outside of 
her. She's a natural athlete. She's got more natural ability than 90% of them." 
</P>
<P>
Akinemod's victory completed a dream afternoon for Klugman. In the opener, his 
Flor 'em Jak, a 4-year-old Jaklin Klugman gelding, broke his maiden at first 
asking. He is also trained by Fanning and was ridden by Stevens, who was aboard 
three winners Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like being reborn," Klugman said. "My heart is going a mile a minute. I 
think I've owned two winners on one card once before in my life and that was 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Fantastic Look, the 9-2 second choice, was 3 1/2 lengths clear of Reluctant 
Guest, then came Affirmed Classic, Kiwi, Linda Card, Stocks Up and Pat Copelan. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Verse, the unluckiest loser the first week of the meeting, may come 
back in the San Fernando Stakes a week from Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Richard Lundy and owned by Allen Paulson, Opening Verse made his 
U.S. and main track debut in Sunday's seventh race. The 4-year-old son of The 
Minstrel drew the rail in the classified allowance mile, moved up comfortably 
to be just off the leaders down the backside, then had nowhere to go almost the 
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
When he finally did get some room, it was too late and he was beaten a 
half-length by Attesa, the longest shot in the field who had rallied from last 
and had clear sailing outside. 
</P>
<P>
"He sure proved he had a lot of heart in that race," said Pat Mitchell, Lundy's 
assistant. "He was ready to run some more when he came back to unsaddle. He was 
fine this morning and the plan is to nominate him to the San Fernando." 
</P>
<P>
A poll of the media covering Santa Anita selected John Henry, Laffit Pincay and 
Charlie Whittingham as the "best" in California thoroughbred racing through the 
just-concluded 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
John Henry, who was horse of the year in both 1981 and '84, received 17 of the 
20 votes cast. Alysheba, Spectacular Bid and Ferdinand received one apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay, who is the world's second-winningest rider behind Bill Shoemaker, 
outpolled Chris McCarron and Eddie Delahoussaye. Whittingham and Wayne Lukas 
were the only trainers to be mentioned.

IF GIANTS ARE LOOKING FOR HELP, THEY WON'T GET IT FROM MEDIA

<P>
If the Rams adhered to Buddy Ryan's pregame philosophy, they'd already be 
sinking their teeth into the New York Giants, this Sunday's NFC divisional 
playoff game opponent at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Taylor? That wimp? The same All-Pro linebacker who was held to two 
excuse-me tackles and no sacks in the Rams' 31-10 thrashing of the Giants in 
November? What's this washout doing on a playoff team? 
</P>
<P>
No such bulletin-board luck for the Giants. The Rams know better, having just 
wiped a week's worth of juiced-up quotes in the face of Ryan's Philadelphia 
Eagles in the form of a 21-7 wild-card victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will make it a point to low-key their approach against the Giants, 
despite having dominated the NFC East champions the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, quarterback Jim Everett tossed five touchdown passes in the 
Rams' 45-31 win over the Giants in the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Last Nov. 12, at Anaheim Stadium, the Rams flattened the Giants, 31-10, in a 
game they led, 31-3, at one point in the fourth quarter. New York shared the 
NFC's best record entering the game at 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have sacked Everett just once in the two meetings. Ram left tackle 
Irv Pankey seems to have what it takes to stop Taylor, who was invisible in the 
November game, drawing public address attention only for two penalties called 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams match up well against the Giants across the board. 
</P>
<P>
You could say the Rams had the Giants' number, but the Rams wouldn't dare. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a chance to play them in the playoffs yet," Everett said. 
"There's no doubt we think they're a good football team. It'll probably be much 
different. They wouldn't have the record they have if they're not a good 
football team." 
</P>
<P>
What kind of game does tailback Greg Bell think it's going to be? Another rout 
like the previous two? Bite your tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a very physical game," Bell said. "We know each other, we've 
been fortunate to come out the victors the last two times we met. I know we're 
going to approach the game the same way we approached this one (against 
Philadelphia). It's going to be a dogfight and it's going to last until there's 
one second left on the clock. If we're in control of the ball, the last five 
minutes, we're going to run the clock out." 
</P>
<P>
Bad question/good answer: Everett, who has passed for 8,274 yards and 60 
touchdowns the past two seasons, was asked after Sunday's game if he felt he is 
starting to arrive as an NFL quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I arriving?" Everett responded. "I hate that question. You guys be the 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Everett feels that he hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I base my arriving on something that has to do with the (Super)Dome this 
year," he said. "My judgment of what a quarterback is, is one who wins the 
Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
After 14 seasons in the league, Ram offensive tackle Jackie Slater has seen it 
all. Oh, really? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't gotten to the point where I think I know it all," he said. "All you 
have to do is go out to practice and have some of these youngsters beat you. 
It's a humbling enough experience. My position is one where you've constantly 
got to work to stay good at it, otherwise you get dominated." 
</P>
<P>
Slater proved again Sunday that he's still good enough. He limited Eagles' 
All-Pro defensive end Reggie White to one sack. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't getting any easier, though. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys like Reggie White and Bruce Smith keep popping up," he said. "They get 
bigger, faster and stronger. They're guys that can dominate. I hate to think 
how big and fast offensive and defensive linemen are eventually going to get." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's win over Philadelphia was the Rams' first playoff win since they 
defeated the Dallas Cowboys, 20-0, in a first-round divisional game in 1985. It 
was the team's first wild-card win since a victory over Dallas in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been awhile," Pankey said. "I think everybody believes. We've been 
through our four-week stretch where we lost games in the last 28 seconds. We've 
been to the down side." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' all-linebacker pass rush team of Kevin Greene, Brett Faryniarz, 
George Bethune and Fred Strickland averages 244 pounds per man if you believe 
the team's current weight listings. Don't believe them. The average is closer 
to 235 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Any more questions about the Rams being wimps in cold weather? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many times you have to play in bad weather to become a 
bad-weather team," guard Tom Newberry said after consecutive wins at New 
England and Philadelphia, both games played in less-than-desirable conditions.

FIRST TROOPS PULLED OUT OF PANAMA; 
</P>
<P>
DEPLOYMENTS: 141 ARTILLERYMEN FROM FT. ORD ARE ON THEIR WAY HOME. BUSH SAYS 
THERE ARE NO NEW DEVELOPMENTS ON THE NORIEGA STANDOFF.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pentagon has begun withdrawing the U.S. invasion force from Panama, sending 
141 soldiers on their way home to Ft. Ord, Calif., the White House announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal, the first since President Bush launched an invasion of Panama 
in the early morning darkness of Dec. 20, was announced aboard Air Force One as 
the President flew from Montgomery, Ala., to Andrews Air Force Base outside 
Washington at the end of a New Year's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"The President is glad to see some of the troops coming home and hopes the rest 
can leave as soon as possible," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made no public comments about the withdrawal, but the White House 
indicated that more troops are likely to return home within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
The troops were among the units that overthrew the regime of Panamanian 
strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
After eluding capture for 4 1/2 days, Noriega sought refuge on Christmas Eve in 
the Vatican's embassy in Panama City. Vatican, Panamanian and U.S. officials 
have been involved since then in negotiations in an effort to solve what Bush 
has called a "conundrum" over the former Panamanian leader's future. 
</P>
<P>
These talks, initially conducted through diplomatic channels in Washington, 
Panama City and the Vatican, intensified beginning Saturday, with 
representatives of all three parties reported to be holding sessions in Panama 
City in an effort to come to a solution. 
</P>
<P>
The United States wants to bring Noriega to trial in federal court in Florida 
on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering contained in indictments 
returned by grand juries in Miami and Tampa. Panama's attorney general has 
announced that he is preparing murder charges against Noriega in the killing of 
10 Panama Defense Forces officers involved in a failed attempt to topple the 
strongman last Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Asked on Monday whether there were any developments leading to a resolution of 
the Noriega question, Bush replied, "Nope." 
</P>
<P>
He has carefully sought to avoid any comment on the matter in recent days in an 
effort to avoid angering the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican traditionally grants sanctuary to persons fleeing religious or 
political persecution. But the United States maintains that Noriega is fleeing 
criminal indictments and is not entitled to political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
The first unit to be withdrawn is made up of 56 soldiers forming part of an 
artillery battery from Ft. Ord. The troops arrived at Kelly Air Force Base in 
San Antonio late Monday night and are scheduled to leave for Ft. Ord. early 
today, an Army spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon official said another plane carrying troops ultimately bound for Ft. 
Ord was due at Kelly but the timing was not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the first pullout was large enough to be considered a withdrawal, 
Fitzwater said: "You've got to start with one. We want them all to come out as 
soon as possible. Chances are they'll come out piecemeal like this." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, asked Sunday about how soon the troops would start coming home, gave no 
hint that a withdrawal was about to begin, saying only, "The sooner the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters aboard the presidential jet, Fitzwater said on Monday 
that "we want them all to come out as soon as possible, except the 12,000 there 
permanently." 
</P>
<P>
Quarry Heights, Panama, is headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command, which has 
jurisdiction over all American military forces south of the U.S. frontier with 
Mexico. About 12,000 service people are permanently stationed at Quarry Heights 
and at other U.S.-operated bases extending along the Panama Canal. Their 
primary mission is the defense and protection of the canal under the Panama 
Canal Treaties of 1977. 
</P>
<P>
As it built up its forces for last month's invasion, the Pentagon dispatched an 
additional 12,000 troops and support personnel to Panama, and once the invasion 
was under way, up to 2,000 additional troops were sent there. The operational 
force encountered difficulties during the first days of the invasion in 
combatting civil disorders that followed the defeat of the Panama Defense 
Forces, up until then Panama's sole military, police and security force. 
Noriega was commander of the now-disbanded PDF. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is we'll see small groups like this coming out on a continuing basis 
from now on," Fitzwater said. "The chances are that they'll come out piecemeal 
like this because of varying duty assignments and mop-up details." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater's expectation was confirmed in Panama by an official of the Southern 
Command who said that an unidentified contingent with 15 vehicles will be 
leaving there today and that "additional redeployment" will take place over the 
next several days. 
</P>
<P>
Under standard military operating procedure, withdrawal of combat troops begins 
within weeks of a successful invasion, after initial objectives have been 
achieved. The remaining troops are assigned a mixture of duties, including 
taking over the operations of decimated military units in the invaded country. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Bush has encountered public demonstrations protesting the 
invasion and demanding that the troops be called home. 
</P>
<P>
He ran into such demonstrations over the weekend in Texas. These included 
protests that took place during a short trip made by the President between 
three military bases in San Antonio -- one of them Kelly Air Force Base -- 
during a morning he spent visiting with soldiers and Marines injured in the 
invasion and brought back to Texas for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, about three dozen protesters demanding a withdrawal from Panama 
greeted him Sunday afternoon in Houston outside the hotel where he maintains a 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
In visiting the wounded troops, Bush made a point of telling them: "The country 
. . . is behind what you did. (Although) every once in a while, somebody might 
take a shot at all of us."

THE 1990 TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE; 
</P>
<P>
TV REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
VIEW FROM THE COUCH: CHANNEL-BY-CHANNEL RATING OF PARADE COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Tournament of Roses didn't go unnoticed Monday -- by Channel 2 or 4 or 5 or 
7 or 11. It was a giant talk-off. 
</P>
<P>
If you were flipping to one of these stations and you stumbled across Channel 
13, you saw people scurrying through city streets. They weren't running to 
watch the parade; they were panicked, fleeing Godzilla. 
</P>
<P>
KCOP, declaring itself neutral in the war of the words, counterprogrammed with 
a likeness of a Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtle hosting a Godzilla marathon of 
English-dubbed Japanese movies. 
</P>
<P>
Zillions watched the parade from curbside in Pasadena -- which is what parade 
watching is about. You can't get the crack and thunder of a marching band or 
the majesty of a giant float through a living-room TV screen. 
</P>
<P>
But the home coverage still reflects, year after year, the marvel of it all. 
Just beware of the banter. 
</P>
<P>
Coverage began with pre-parade trivia and preparatory superlatives at 7 a.m. 
with the most aggressive of the hostiles, KTLA (5) and KTTV (11). In their ads, 
both promised the best camera locations, the best commentators, the best stereo 
sound. And both would keep their cameras on the parade without departing for 
commercials. (Plugs for the sponsors were laid over the parade images.) 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to assess bests. The commentators all work from the basic facts and 
factoids assembled by the parade producers. 
</P>
<P>
But certain truths emerge from watching the swirl of coverage. One is that for 
such occasions, you need professionals. Professionals in the art of banter. 
</P>
<P>
NBC (KNBC, Channel 4) assigned commentating duty to actors Blair Underwood and 
Barbara Eden, who were about as compatible as oil and water. He was mostly 
uncomfortable; her contribution was mostly "oh wow," "oooh," "wooo" and "oh my 
heavens!" 
</P>
<P>
She also did her Zsa Zsa Gabor impression as the real Zsa Zsa bounced by on a 
Tennessee Walker. 
</P>
<P>
On CBS (KCBS, Channel 2), actor-hosts Kevin Dobson and Mary Frann were out of 
sync. She particularly seemed out of character waxing philosophical about the 
state of the world and invoking Albert Schweitzer quotations about how people 
can only be truly happy helping others. On ABC (KABC, Channel 7), Joan Lunden 
and Jim McKay, who have careers in banter, were generally the least silly and 
had the best sense for reporting the parade. Their program included some snappy 
interviews with just-folks along the parade route and a few features like one 
from inside the Baskin-Robbins float -- mother cow and wobbly calf -- that said 
more about the magnificence of these floats than anything else presented the 
whole day. 
</P>
<P>
ABC also seemed to be the only station to report that police carted some 
protesters away from the parade. Others instead flipped to footage of smiling 
Grand Marshal John Glenn, the former-astronaut-turned-senator who probably was 
happy that the protest had nothing to do with the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
On KTLA, Stephanie Edwards and Bob Eubanks are vets of such events, and their 
asides were sensibly chosen. Eubanks did soften his usual raucousness. He, of 
course, is snared in a controversy about a tasteless AIDS-Jewish women joke 
that he cracked for the cameras and that now is being shown in the current 
docucomedy film "Roger and Me." 
</P>
<P>
Rival KTTV employed a panel of three for its color -- actress Deidre Hall, 
"Jeopardy" host Alex Trebek and veteran reporter Bill Welsh, who figures this 
was his 43rd straight Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
KTLA and KTTV distinctly had the best camera spots, as both had promised, and 
some of their close-ups brought nice dimension to the parade. But it was a 
tossup, although KTTV's coverage ran one minute longer than KTLA's. 
</P>
<P>
And in a coverage overwrought with platitudes and superlatives, Trebek spoke 
the final cliche of the day: "A good time was had by all." 
</P>
<P>
A good time also was had by all on Channel 13. Earth was saved once more, just 
at the last moment, and that always makes for a good day. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on with the football. . . .

100 SOVIET JEWS ARRIVE IN ISRAEL ON DIRECT EL AL FLIGHT FROM MOSCOW

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel on Monday from Moscow on an 
unprecedented direct chartered flight by the Israeli national airline El Al. 
</P>
<P>
Among those greeting the immigrants at Ben-Gurion International Airport near 
Tel Aviv was Uri Gordon, head of the immigration and absorption department in 
the Jewish Agency, which helps resettle newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very moving, a historic moment," Gordon said. "One can see on their 
faces what it means to them to come to the Jewish state." 
</P>
<P>
Sources in Israel's Transport Ministry and El Al expressed hope that the flight 
will increase the chances of an agreement to allow regular flights between the 
two countries, the Israeli daily Haaretz reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union broke ties with Israel after the 1967 Israeli-Arab War, but 
relations have warmed in the past two years with an exchange of consular 
missions and dozens of cultural activities. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, about 12,000 Soviet Jews emigrated to Israel. This is the highest 
number of immigrants to arrive in Israel from the Soviet Union since the 1970s, 
Israel Radio reported. In December alone, 3,500 out of the 8,500 Jews who left 
the Soviet Union came to settle in Israel, the radio reported.

SHAMIR FIRM AS COALITION TEETERS;

ISRAEL: HAWKISH PRIME MINISTER REFUSES TO BUDGE ON HIS FIRING OF SCIENCE 
MINISTER EZER WEIZMAN.

Efforts to find a compromise that would keep Israel's divided government intact 
were deadlocked Monday, and officials close to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
said that he is determined to assert his authority over dovish ministers in the 
teetering coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister is standing firm," said Yosef Ben-Aharon, a top aide to 
Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, who heads the rightist Likud Party, fired Science Minister Ezer 
Weizman, from the center-left Labor Party, for making direct and indirect 
contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization and discussing peace 
proposals with the group. The Sunday dismissal set off the government crisis. 
</P>
<P>
However, there were wire service reports early today that President Chaim 
Herzog had stepped into the crisis and suggested a compromise that might defuse 
the issue. They quoted Israel Television as saying that, in a private meeting 
with Shamir, Herzog said the crisis calls for a "proper legal inquiry" and that 
Weizeman should be allowed to keep his Cabinet post until the inquiry is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Labor wants Weizman reinstated. Both parties were busily courting minor 
political groups in order to build a narrow coalition should the coalition 
shatter. But Labor, the junior partner in the national unity government, is 
also looking for a compromise. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor said he 
views "the continuation of the national unity government as the need of the 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
However, Israel Television said that Shimon Peres, vice prime minister and 
Labor Party leader, quickly rejected the Herzog proposal, saying the damage had 
already been done. 
</P>
<P>
One solution under discussion is to remove Weizman from the policy-making Inner 
Cabinet, which is made up of six members each from Labor and Likud. Yitzhak 
Peretz, leader of the small, religious Shas party who is trying to mediate a 
compromise, reported no headway Monday. "It is hard to say I see a way out," 
Peretz said. 
</P>
<P>
Under government rules, the dismissal of Weizman, a flamboyant former fighter 
pilot and defense minister, is set to become final today. A vote of confidence 
in the government has been scheduled later in the week -- not because of 
Weizman and the PLO but because religious parties object to government 
authorization of a protest rally last week on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
He's Sending Messages 
</P>
<P>
Likud officials said that, by firing Weizman, the prime minister is sending out 
a variety of messages, not only to political rivals at home but to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
First, he is trying to re-establish his own authority, which he saw as being 
eroded by Weizman's contacts with the PLO, government spokesman Yosef Olmert 
said. The Labor Party, led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, has been trying to 
pull Shamir toward compromise on the issue of giving up the occupied West Bank 
and Gaza Strip in return for peace with rebellious Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"Shamir is saying, 'I'm the boss,' in case anyone forgot," Olmert declared. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir was also shoring up his hold on the Likud, where he was under attack for 
being soft on talks with the PLO, Olmert added. 
</P>
<P>
The message for Washington arises from Shamir's perception that the Bush 
Administration intends to try to corner him into talks with the PLO. Shamir 
opposes PLO participation in peace talks because he views the group's demand 
for an independent Palestinian state as a means of setting up a hostile base 
next door to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"If people in Washington think the prime minister wants a fig leaf to talk with 
the PLO, I can say that this prime minister does not play with fig leaves," 
Olmert said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is engaged in laborious talks with the Bush Administration over plans to 
negotiate with a Palestinian peace delegation. The PLO has been responding to 
the American overtures for talks through Egyptian mediation. Under a plan 
authored by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the United States, Egypt and 
Israel have agreed to meet in the coming weeks to discuss the formation of a 
Palestinian negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
Weizman expressed pleasure at being the center of a political storm. On Israel 
Radio, he stated flatly that he hopes the coalition will fall over his ouster. 
Weizman is a proponent of Israeli-PLO talks. 
</P>
<P>
Weizman was a key participant in the crafting of the 1979 Camp David peace 
treaty between Israel and Egypt. The experience converted him from a hawk -- he 
belonged to the Likud at the time -- to a dove. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of Weizman's PLO connection center on an Israeli Arab physician named 
Ahmed Tibi, whose name had surfaced publicly in efforts to contact the PLO over 
missing Israeli prisoners in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Weizman told a Labor Party caucus Monday that not long ago he received a phone 
call from Tibi who was visiting Tunis, the headquarters of the PLO. Tibi asked 
him if the PLO should accept the Baker plan for peace talks. Weizman put Tibi 
on hold and phoned an unnamed Israeli official. 
</P>
<P>
He went back to Tibi and advised the PLO to accept U.S. plans to hold talks and 
if it had reservations, to put them in the form of conditions that could then 
be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO has accepted Baker's plan in principle but is demanding that it select 
the Palestinian panel. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir learned of Weizman's activities from the Shin Bet, Israel's domestic 
intelligence service, officials in the prime minister's office said. It was not 
clear whether the agency was spying on Weizman -- that would require 
authorization from Shamir himself.

NEW YEAR REVELRY ALSO SPLITS BEIRUT;

LEBANON: PRO-IRANIAN HEZBOLLAH TRIES TO KEEP IT QUIET BUT NIGHT SPOTS ARE HOT 
IN SYRIAN, CHRISTIAN AREAS.

<P>
With only hours to go before Lebanon left the tragic 1980s and headed for a new 
decade, Beirutis on both sides of the Green Line rushed about gathering the 
ingredients for Ras-issini, Arabic for New Year's. Shops opened Sunday, 
allowing residents to buy everything from sequin gowns to Seagram's gin and 
smoked salmon. 
</P>
<P>
Since the deployment of Syrian troops in Muslim West Beirut in February, 1987, 
the influence of Hezbollah -- the fundamentalist, pro-Iranian "Party of God" -- 
over West Beirut night life and the beverages usually associated with it has 
been restricted to the areas it controls in Beirut's predominantly Shiite 
Muslim southern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
El Mustapha supermarket, located in one of those suburbs, was well-stocked with 
party hats, noisemakers and balloons. There were even a few artificial 
Christmas trees left and a handful of Christmas cards as well. The supermarket 
also sells non-alcoholic beer which, like the cards, comes from Iran. 
</P>
<P>
But early Sunday morning, members of Hezbollah put a damper on partying. 
Touring areas under its control with loudspeakers, it warned residents that 
after 9 p.m. New Year's Eve, no one would be allowed into the area for the rest 
of the night. And those leaving the area could not return before 7 a.m. Monday. 
One resident reckoned that this move was an attempt to keep people from 
bringing in alcoholic beverages from other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident admitted that he already had his whiskey hidden away but that 
he would celebrate at home watching television. Even that was difficult as 
electricity rationing left most of the city dark. 
</P>
<P>
Using a home generator could have been the answer, but "Hezbollah Ordinance II" 
ordered that no generator noise would be allowed after 10 p.m. The noise, the 
militiamen said, would interfere with the call to evening prayers. 
</P>
<P>
Even battery-run boom boxes were included in the noise ordinance. Hezbollah 
warned that loud music would not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, just minutes away from the southern suburbs are two of West 
Beirut's hottest night spots -- Summerland and the Coral Beach night club. 
Dinner, dancing and drinks cost a couple nearly $200 there. Hezbollah holds no 
sway in that area because the Syrian headquarters are just down the street. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrian presence in West Beirut has made merrymaking safe and profitable for 
merchants who once took a dangerous risk to openly sell alcohol. On the other 
hand, staying on good terms with the Syrians requires diplomacy and occasional 
seasonal largess. It is, in other words, the merchants duty to provide free 
shopping from time to time to Syrian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
For a Good Time . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to have a good time tonight (New Year's Eve)," said a traveler to 
his American seatmate as they landed at Beirut airport, "go to East Beirut. 
That's were the action is." 
</P>
<P>
Christian East Beirut's posh restaurants such as Don Carlos offered a gala 
dinner, free-flowing drinks, party hats and an orchestra to set the mood, all 
for $130 a couple. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lebanon has the reputation of being war-torn and poor, New Year's Eve 
is no time to search for evidence to prove it on either side of the Green Line, 
which separates mainly Muslim West Beirut from Christian-dominated East Beirut. 
Jimmy's Disco in West Beirut had entertainment as well as dinner and drinks for 
$300 a couple. "Down and Out in Beirut" wouldn't make such a bad movie title, 
when one comes to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
In East Beirut, the striking of the clock at midnight gave way to an odd scene. 
Lebanese Forces militiamen, standing on apartment balconies and back-lit by 
Christmas trees, fired thousands of tracer bullets from their M-16s. 
</P>
<P>
In the western sector, the Syrians followed suit, and militias on the Green 
Line joined the fun as their streams of tracers crisscrossed a sky already lit 
up by flashes of lightning. 
</P>
<P>
On the official government level, New Year's activities began and ended with 
Lebanon's new president giving a five-minute, year-end message, promising the 
Lebanese "a strong and capable state" in 1990. Using the slogan "Reconciliation 
is the path to reforms," President Elias Hrawi aimed his comments at Lebanon's 
rebellious army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, who has refused to vacate 
Baabda Palace, the Lebanese White House. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun does not recognize Hrawi as president, accusing him of being a Syrian 
stooge. Aoun's demand for a complete Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon is what was 
behind the six months of intense fighting that claimed more than 900 lives 
between March and September. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how noisy it was New Year's Eve, it wasn't anything like the hours of 
crashing shells and rocket exchanges that characterized "night life" in Beirut 
last spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Aoun's supporters held a bash outside Baabda Palace on Sunday 
night, bringing their own food and drink. Dubbed the most popular (and 
cheapest) hangout in East Beirut, the palace grounds swarmed with merrymakers 
in spite of rain.

Israel on Monday imposed an indefinite curfew on 650,000 Arabs in the Gaza 
Strip, reinforcing troops there and in the West Bank to prevent demonstrations, 
the army said. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders of a two-year revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied 
territories had called for celebrations Monday commemorating the founding in 
1965 of Fatah, the mainstream Palestine Liberation Organization group headed by 
Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists are barred from the Gaza Strip unless accompanied by an army 
escort, an army spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The army also imposed curfews Sunday on the Hebron market and Ramallah in the 
West Bank.

ROMANIA: THE NEW GOVERNMENT ALSO DOES AWAY WITH THE DEATH PENALTY AND SHORTENS 
THE WORKWEEK TO FIVE DAYS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The new Romanian government announced Monday that it has abolished the death 
penalty, disbanded Nicolae Ceausescu's hated secret police, the Securitate, and 
will introduce a five-day workweek. 
</P>
<P>
A week after Ceausescu, 71, and his wife, Elena, were executed by a military 
firing squad, the revocation of the death penalty and other steps were made 
public by interim President Ion Iliescu in a New Year's television address. 
</P>
<P>
"The two executions will be the last to be carried out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The interim president's speech was part of an energetic campaign by the new 
government to win the trust of 23 million Romanians who lived for the last 24 
years under one of the world's most oppressive Communist regimes. 
</P>
<P>
"No attempt by the remains of the old regime is capable of turning back the 
wheel of history again," Iliescu said. "The process that has occurred is 
irreversible. The popular revolution has triumphed, and it will remain 
unvanquishable." 
</P>
<P>
He announced a decree abolishing the Securitate, the vast secret police 
organization that was a pervasive presence in Romanian society. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to members of the Securitate who have not yet surrendered, he said 
that "all further terrorists will be prosecuted according to the valid laws of 
the land." 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu said the five-day workweek will be introduced in March. A six-day week 
had been customary. 
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the government is abandoning a principle of the 
Ceausescu regime that considered all land the property of the state. 
Henceforth, he said, homeowners can consider the land that their houses stand 
on as their own. Farmers, he said, will be allowed to buy land adjoining their 
houses and will be able to farm privately and sell their produce on the free 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Romanians who were forced to relocate to cities and towns under Ceausescu's 
scheme to move farmers off land will be allowed to move back and will be 
alloted six-tenths of an acre of land, "providing they commit themselves to pay 
taxes and cultivate the land well." 
</P>
<P>
In moves to build public confidence, leading figures in the interim government 
began appearing in television interviews Sunday to explain their past 
connections with the Communist Party, run with an iron hand by Ceausescu and 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Salvation Front council decided to tackle head-on the 
complaints voiced by some Romanians that too many Communists have been included 
in the new government, which will run the country until free elections are held 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
Silviu Brucan, a 73-year-old former diplomat and possibly the most widely 
respected member of the 11-member council at the head of the National Salvation 
Front, appeared on television Sunday night in an hourlong interview. He 
explained that he and others on the council had constituted virtually the only 
opposition to the Ceausescu regime in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Brucan was placed under house arrest in 1987 for protesting in an open letter 
to Ceausescu that Romanians were sufferring under the Draconian austerity 
program he imposed on the country. The letter charged that the people were 
faced with starvation and were "freezing in their own houses." 
</P>
<P>
Brucan said that in the future, "there can be no 'isms' in Romania." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not Communists," Brucan said. "We are not anything. Theory has been 
destroyed in this country." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier in the day, Brucan indicated that the National 
Salvation Front decided to move quickly to counter any suggestion that its 
leading members had been sympathetic in any way to the Ceausescu regime. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of establishing our credentials," Brucan said. "It is an 
overriding consideration. People must know what we did." 
</P>
<P>
In the coming days, he said, Petre Roman, the interim prime minister, and 
interim President Iliescu will make similar television appearances. 
</P>
<P>
National Salvation Front sources said Sunday that, in effect, they are in the 
initial stages of what will likely become their campaign for the April 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
So far, six organizations have announced they intend to form political parties 
with a view to competing in the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the National Peasants Party, after a meeting with Dumitru 
Mazilu, a vice president of the council, said they were assured that the 
National Salvation Front is committed to free and fair elections.

NEW CZECH LEADER ORDERS AMNESTY FOR UP TO 30,000

<P>
Newly installed President Vaclav Havel, a playwright who spent five years in 
jail as a dissident, announced a nationwide amnesty Monday that could cover up 
to 30,000 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
In an announcement read on television, he said he will free all prisoners 
facing or serving sentences of up to two years for crimes committed 
deliberately, and also prisoners with terms of three years for crimes committed 
out of negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Those with longer sentences would have up to half remitted. 
</P>
<P>
The amnesty does not cover people charged with abuse of public position, 
including former Communist officials, and with a number of criminal offenses 
such as murder, armed robbery and rape. 
</P>
<P>
Petr Uhl, a member of a government committee set up to investigate prison 
conditions, estimated that about 40,000 people are imprisoned in 
Czechoslovakia. He said that up to three-quarters of them apparently would be 
eligible for amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of political prisoners have already been released under an amnesty 
granted by former President Gustav Husak. He acted last year after huge 
pro-democracy protests and the fall of Communist hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, who took office last week, was jailed for his dissident activities by 
the former government. 
</P>
<P>
In a New Year's message before the amnesty announcement, Havel pledged to lift 
his country from a mire of political hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing is that we live in a contaminated moral environment . . . 
because we became used to saying something different from what we thought," 
Havel declared. He called on Czechoslovakia to rediscover its self-confidence 
and help Europe restore the concept of morality in politics.

Bus fares and gasoline doubled in price and electricity quadrupled Monday under 
a radical plan by the non-Communist government to transform Poland's centrally 
planned economy to capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
The price of coal, a major source of heat in Polish homes, officially increased 
by 600%, the cost of electricity by 400% and the price of heating gas by 400%. 
</P>
<P>
Rail and intercity bus passengers found that ticket prices had gone up an 
average of 250%, while the price of municipal bus tickets doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Most gasoline stations were shut for the New Year's holiday. However, those 
open were selling regular gasoline for 2,400 zlotys per liter, up from 1,200 
zlotys. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz acknowledged that there will be hardships 
in the coming months. However, he stressed that the increases are needed to 
halt Poland's 900% annual inflation and to end the nation's economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no solutions devoid of risk," the official news agency PAP quoted 
him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The far-reaching plan is intended to supplant the centrally directed economy 
run by the Communists during their four-decade rule. But there is concern that 
the economic shock will be too much for Poles, who earn an average monthly wage 
of 350,000 zlotys ($37).

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev continued a New Year's tradition and 
wished the American people a happy new year and said the 1990s will be "a 
decade of the drawing of the United States and the Soviet Union closer 
together." 
</P>
<P>
In a companion message broadcast on Soviet television, President Bush praised 
Gorbachev as "a good partner in peace" and invited the people of the Soviet 
Union today to "look forward to a new century, and a new millennium, of peace, 
freedom and prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
The messages continued an exchange begun by Gorbachev and former President

Gorbachev's video message said, "The year 1990 can and must bring nearer a 
genuinely peaceful period of world history. There are still hesitations, 
wait-and-see attitudes, doubts and suspicions. But all this only reaffirms the 
crucial nature of the current situation." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev called for making the 1990s "a decade of the drawing of the United 
States and the Soviet Union closer together on the basis of universal human 
values and the balance of interests. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"The entire world proceeds ahead. It wants happiness, freedom and prosperity. 
And it would be naive, senseless and dangerous to try to thwart this aspiration 
for a better future. 
</P>
<P>
"During the Malta meeting, President Bush and I agreed that it was essential to 
get away from the Cold War and to abandon the Cold War instruments as well, so 
that 1990 and subsequent years could open up a period of genuine cooperation 
before us." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev concluded by saying, "I wholeheartedly wish all Americans a happy new 
year."

29 DIE IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS OVER HOLIDAY; DRUNK DRIVER ARRESTS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
During what traffic officials refer to as the "deadliest season of the year," 
29 people died on California roads as the New Year's weekend drew to a close. 
</P>
<P>
Though the number was down from 33 deaths during the same period last year, 
drunk driving arrests went up, California Highway Patrol Sgt. Mike Brey said. 
</P>
<P>
From 6 p.m. Friday, when the holiday reporting period began, to 6 a.m. Monday, 
2,156 people were arrested, compared with 1,725 last year, the Highway Patrol 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were hesitant to say if a new law that went into effect on New 
Year's Day, lowering the blood alcohol content standard for legal drunkenness 
from .10 to .08, led to the increase in the number of people arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"We may make more arrests but that is not the point," Brey said. "It won't be 
the number of arrests that will change attitudes about drinking and driving. 
That will come when the public understands the position law enforcement has 
taken -- that you don't have to be falling down drunk for your driving to be 
impaired. If you exhibit symptoms of intoxication, regardless of whether you 
are over the legal limit or not, you can still be arrested and booked for DUI." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, police said they arrested 188 drivers, 128 of them on New 
Year's Eve. The total was about the same as last year, police said.

USC BEATS BO IN HIS LAST ROSE BOWL, 17-10 
</P>

Ricky Ervins scored on a 14-yard run with 1:10 to play, lifting 12th-ranked USC 
to a 17-10 victory over third-ranked Michigan in the Rose Bowl game at Pasadena 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Schembechler, in his last game as Michigan's coach, closed his career with a 
2-8 record in Rose Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans finished the season 9-2-1; Michigan is 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's other bowl games: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Peter Tom Willis threw for 422 yards and five touchdowns, both Fiesta Bowl 
records, as fifth-ranked Florida State routed No. 6 Nebraska 41-17 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The victory capped a 10-2 season for Florida State, which won its final 10 
games. Nebraska also finished at 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst overall loss for Nebraska since Oklahoma beat the Cornhuskers 
38-7 in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chuck Webb ran for 250 yards, the second-best rushing performance in Cotton 
Bowl history, as eighth-ranked Tennessee beat 10th-ranked Arkansas, 31-27, at 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Webb, a freshman, carried 26 times and scored twice, including a 78-yard run. 
Rice's Dicky Maegle set the Cotton Bowl record of 265 yards against Alabama in 
1954. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee finished with an 11-1 record; Arkansas is 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reggie Slack completed his last 12 passes before halftime and led 
ninth-ranked Auburn to a 31-14 victory over 21st-ranked Ohio State in the Hall 
of Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
After suffering two interceptions, Slack threw touchdown passes of 11 and 4 
yards to Greg Taylor that gave the Tigers the lead for good. Greg Frey, 
quarterback for Ohio State, was sacked four times. Auburn finished at 10-2, 
Ohio State at 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the Citrus Bowl at Orlando, Fla., Jeff George passed for a season-high 
321 yards and three touchdowns as 11th-ranked Illinois defeated 15th-ranked 
Virginia, 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first bowl game victory for the Illini (11-2) since their 17-7 win 
over Washington in the 1964 Rose Bowl. The Cavaliers finished at 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
The final rankings in the Associated Press poll will be released today.

COCAINE DEATH SQUAD CHIEF SEIZED, POLICE SAY

<TEXT>
<P>
The chief of the death squads organized by the Medellin cocaine cartel was 
arrested at a police roadblock in central Colombia, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest drug-trafficking suspect to be arrested was Jose Manuel Cruz 
Aguirre, who is wanted in Peru, the Administrative Security Police said in a 
communique Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz Aguirre was arrested Friday evening on a highway about 35 miles south of 
Bogota, the security police said. There were no immediate details on what 
charges he faces. 
</P>
<P>
Death squads financed by drug traffickers have killed scores of peasants 
suspected of sympathizing with leftist guerrillas, who have tried to extort 
money from cattle ranchers in areas where traffickers hold property. 
</P>
<P>
The squads also have killed about 740 members of the country's biggest leftist 
political party, the Patriotic Union, presumably because the party has the 
support of the country's estimated 10,000 guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz Aguirre was part owner of one of Colombia's professional soccer teams, 
Deportes Tolima, the security police said. Colombian authorities have contended 
for years that drug bosses are among the owners of several professional soccer 
teams in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre was the third purported member of the Medellin cartel arrested in four 
days. The others were Jose Antonio Ocampo Obando and Camilo Antonio Ruiz Vega. 
</P>
<P>
Ocampo Obando, arrested Friday, is wanted for extradition by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz Vega, arrested Thursday, was a top confidant of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, 
the No. 2 man killed by police Dec. 15.

A suspected drunk driver was shot to death in his driveway by California 
Highway Patrol officers when he fired an assault rifle at them, officials said. 
Officers Brian Smith and Tom Sayles tried to stop Mark Ivey, 28, as he drove 
eastbound on Casa Loma Drive about 1:15 a.m., CHP dispatcher Linda Stevens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ivey did not stop his pickup truck, so the officers pursued him until he 
stopped in his driveway in the Rexland Acres area, Stevens said. As Officers 
Ken Perez and Victor Lacey arrived to join Smith and Sayles, Ivey pulled out an 
assault rifle resembling an Uzi and fired at least one round at the officers, 
Stevens said. All four of the officers returned fire.

State transportation officials have warned riders of San Francisco Bay ferries 
that they must continue to use the service if they hope to win the battle for 
extended service between San Francisco and the East Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of dollars will be needed to save the service that began in the 
transportation crisis that followed the Oct. 17 earthquake, officials said. The 
state Department of Transportation has warned ferry riders that subsidies will 
run out March 23. Although exact figures are not available, officials estimate 
that 3,000 riders use the ferries daily, compared to 15,000 passengers daily 
when the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge was closed after the quake.

An Alameda couple became parents of test-tube quadruplets on the last day of 
the 1980s. Ted and Maria Lusignan, who had been trying to have a baby for six 
years, now have three girls and a boy born in four minutes. The babies, 10 
weeks premature and ranging in weight from 2 pounds, 12 ounces to 1 pound, were

TELEVISION / LARRY STEWART: BOWL GAME LINEUP: TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, there is such a thing as too much football. 
</P>
<P>
Seven bowl games on New Year's Day is about four too many. 
</P>
<P>
While the NFL presents a nice, neat postseason tournament, what the colleges 
present is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
Try watching seven games within an 11-hour span. It's enough to make your head 
spin worse than any New Year's Day hangover. 
</P>
<P>
The first game Monday was the Hall of Fame Bowl game. NBC had to cut away from 
its coverage of the Rose Parade, but at least it didn't run into the 
overlapping problems that ABC did. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame Bowl game ended, NBC wasted little time switching to the 
Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It was nice and clean, far better than ABC's switch from the Florida Citrus 
Bowl game to the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
ABC took its time making the switch. ABC started off by showing a promotional 
spot for the upcoming Rose Bowl game. Thanks, but we knew it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a promo for ABC Sports, then a 'thank-you" promo to an airline that 
provides it with free travel. Then there were two promos for ABC shows, 
followed by a news brief. 
</P>
<P>
What next? Three consecutive commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, an introduction for the Rose Bowl game, followed by a taped interview 
with Bo Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Then came more ABC Sports graphics and two more commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, by the way, the Cotton Bowl on CBS was still going on. Arkansas scored on a 
long pass play and after a failed two-point conversion attempt, the Razorbacks 
trailed Tennessee, 31-27, with 1:29 left. 
</P>
<P>
OK, we were finally going to see the Rose Bowl game kickoff, right? Nah. 
</P>
<P>
First there was a Big Ten promo, more ABC graphics and then finally a glimpse 
of the Rose Bowl, where the crowd was finishing singing the National Anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Then came an introduction from announcer Keith Jackson, and another taped piece 
on Schembechler, this one showing a 1971 pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
Next was another commercial, then a Pacific 10 promo followed by one more 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
The teams finally took the field, and Jackson and commentator Bob Griese then 
offered a little pregame analysis, as if there already hadn't been enough. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Fiesta Bowl game, Florida State missed a field-goal attempt 
and trailed Nebraska, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Rose Bowl game kickoff came, 18 minutes after the end of the 
Citrus Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
One play after the kickoff at the Rose Bowl game, Florida State recovered a 
fumble to set up its first touchdown to tie the score on the way to a rout of 
the Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
At least we were down to only two games, the Cotton Bowl game having ended. 
</P>
<P>
It was quite a task trying to watch the Hall of Fame, the Citrus and the Cotton 
Bowl games all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The Cotton Bowl game was the last of the three early games to start. 
</P>
<P>
The Citrus Bowl game began shortly after ABC went from Pasadena to Orlando, 
Fla.But it didn't take long to realize there was going to be a time squeeze 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Citrus Bowl game announcer Gary Bender sensed it. As officials 
discussed a first-quarter penalty, Bender said: "Come on, fellas, we've got a 
lot of football to play today." 
</P>
<P>
If you happened to be watching the Hall of Fame Bowl game you saw Ohio State's 
Zack Dumas level Auburn's Stacy Danley. 
</P>
<P>
Announcer Don Criqui first said: "That's got to be the hardest hit of the 
'89-90 bowl season." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after viewing a replay, Criqui said: "It's the hardest hit I've seen in 
football in years." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it was. 
</P>
<P>
A little later in the game, Criqui, talking about Auburn's Shayne Wasden's punt 
returns of 30 and 34 yards, said they broke the Orange Bowl game record. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you can't blame Criqui for being confused. He worked the last eight 
Orange Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of flubs, O.J. Simpson, during halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl game, 
referred to Notre Dame's George Gipp as George Kemp, or something like that. 
However, Simpson did catch the mistake and corrected himself. 
</P>
<P>
In referring to Gipp's death, comparing it to the death of Colorado quarterback 
Sal Aunese, Simpson said it occurred a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
NBC colleague Bob Costas, fearing Simpson's attempt at sarcasm was probably 
lost on most viewers, added: "It was more than a few years ago. It was so long 
ago that a young Ronald Reagan could play Gipp (in the 1940 movie, 'The Knute 
Rockne All-American')." 
</P>
<P>
During halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl game, Gayle Gardner -- yes, she still 
works for NBC -- did a nice taped interview with Miami Coach Dennis Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
And Gardner, during halftime of the Fiesta Bowl game, offered an excellent 
feature on the once-troubled Colorado football program and the death of Aunese 
this past September. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, meanwhile, deserves kudos for a halftime segment it showed during the 
Cotton Bowl. It chronicled the highlights of college football during the 1980s, 
including California's 1982 kickoff return against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
NBC broke a story that Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez would 
become coach at Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
The network had Ralph Wiley interview Alvarez later in the day, but because of 
technical problems, had to cut away from it earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
On this long day and night of football, the overall coverage and the announcing 
was fine. 
</P>
<P>
But something needs to be done about the logjam. The way things are now, it's 
impossible to see everything. 
</P>
<P>
Just trying is a real job -- and no fun.

TV GAME SHOW PILOTS FIGHTING FOR AIR TIME; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: WITH A HUGE POTENTIAL PAYOFF AT STAKE, PRODUCERS OF PROGRAMS FOR 
SYNDICATION HOPE TO SPELL TROUBLE FOR 'WHEEL OF FORTUNE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A videotape is popped into a machine and Merv Griffin appears, eager to tell 
everyone about "the biggest project I've ever worked on." Best known today for 
his involvement with hotels and TV programs, Griffin is now out pushing an 
enterprise that combines elements of both: "Monopoly," a syndicated game show. 
</P>
<P>
After Griffin's brief spiel on the tape -- "Peter Tomarken is a wonnnnderful 
host" -- the pilot for the program runs. Salespeople representing Griffin and 
King World, which will distribute the show, are blanketing the country, playing 
the cassette for TV station executives who might buy "Monopoly." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin and King World already produce and distribute the nation's top two 
syndicated shows, "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" If they can sell their 
video version of the classic board game to enough stations to make it worth 
producing, they stand to make millions. 
</P>
<P>
But it won't be easy. The offices of TV station executives are thick with 
salespeople these days. This is selling season for the syndicated television 
industry, a period that will culminate with frenzied deal-making this month at 
the National Assn. of Television Program Executives convention in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of syndicated offerings are vying for attention in categories ranging 
from talk shows ("Voices of America With Jesse Jackson"), to series ("The New 
Dragnet") to network reruns ("Head of the Class") to the offbeat ("TV 
Personals"). Nowhere does the competition appear steeper than in game shows, 
however. The bright lights, bells, buzzers and toothsome hosts belie the 
cutthroat nature of the business. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting for syndicated slots this round -- the programmers' convention will be 
the Bonus Round -- are "Monopoly"; "Trump Card" from Warner Bros.; "The 
Challengers" from Dick Clark Productions and Buena Vista Television; "Quiz Kids 
Challenge" from Guber-Peters; and remakes of "Tic Tac Dough" from ITC, "The 
Joker's Wild" from Orbis Communications and "Name That Tune" from Orion. 
</P>
<P>
Out of those game shows, which are considered to be the major contenders for 
success, and the countless lesser hopefuls, only two, maybe three will make it 
into production, say industry experts. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that there are few time slots available for new syndicated 
shows. Besides "Wheel" and "Jeopardy!," which each appear on more than 200 
stations across the country, valuable time slots already are taken by other 
types of syndicated programs. "Oprah Winfrey," "Entertainment Tonight" and "A 
Current Affair" are still going strong. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the potential payoff is great enough that for many production 
companies it is worth the expense of taping a pilot and unleashing a sales 
team. Most game-show producers sell their programs through "cash plus barter." 
That means they not only get paid by the stations buying the show, but they 
keep the rights to some of the available commercial time, which they sell 
themselves. If they syndicate their program to enough stations -- 70% of the 
country is generally considered the minimum -- the producers can sell lucrative 
national advertising spots. 
</P>
<P>
Game-show sales may also get a boost this year from an advertiser backlash 
against trashy programs. "There's advertiser resistance to titillating talk 
shows and magazine shows of a tabloid nature," says Jon Gluck, vice president 
of programming for MMT Sales Inc., which advises stations. National advertisers 
are growing concerned about advertising on "the 'Geraldos,' the 'Hard Copies,' 
the 'Current Affairs' and even the 'Oprahs' and 'Donahues,' " he said. Games 
shows, says Gluck, offer "a very healthy advertising environment." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the lure of cash and lovely prizes that await successful 
game-show producers, this year's contestants smell an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling that the time is right to challenge 'Wheel,' " says Gluck. 
Although it remains a strong No. 1, Vanna White's show is slipping in the 
ratings and competitors are anxiously awaiting the day the wheel stops 
spinning. 
</P>
<P>
While each game-show producer is trying to carve a separate niche, all keep an 
eye on the basic elements that have made "Wheel" an institution. More than 
anything else, game shows have to get viewers involved. Part of the genius of 
"Wheel," say observers, is that it's designed to make the folks at home feel 
smarter than the contestants. Even when an answer becomes obvious, the show's 
contestants often must wait to guess. By that time, viewers are ready to burst, 
wishing they could tell Vanna the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have a game show people can play along with," says Rick Feldman, 
general manager of Los Angeles station KCOP Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman already has purchased "Tic Tac Dough" and "Joker's Wild" for next year, 
believing that the remakes already have "recognizability." 
</P>
<P>
A look at some of the games shows considered to have the best chance of making 
it: 
</P>
<P>
* "Monopoly" -- Griffin and the King Brothers have managed to boil down the 
board game so it takes less than a half hour to play. But Monopoly purist may 
squirm at the way this is accomplished. Contestants gain properties by guessing 
easy questions (Q: Wabbit hunter. A: Elmer Fudd.). The players buy houses and 
hotels off-camera during the commercial breaks and a midget in a tux runs 
around a giant board to mark where each player has landed. The host, the midget 
and winner dance around the board at the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Michael King of King World says that his Monopoly rules are a little different 
than the standard rules, but he argues that "nobody really plays Monopoly by 
the same set of rules." 
</P>
<P>
"Merv may not know what casinos to buy, but he knows what game shows to buy," 
says Bill Carroll, director of programming for Katz American Television, a 
consulting firm. "Merv was able to take hangman and make 'Wheel of Fortune.' I 
can't discount his ability to take a board game and make it a video game." 
Nonetheless, he says it's too early to tell whether the show will make it. 
</P>
<P>
* "Challengers" -- With Dick Clark as host, this game asks contestants tough, 
often topical and newsy questions. The producers plan to tape the show 
year-round so they can keep the questions current. The show is designed to air 
just before or after evening newscasts, a lucrative location for syndicated 
fare. "We thought the audience interest in question-and-answer shows was being 
underserved," says Jamie Bennett, senior vice president at Buena Vista 
Television, which will distribute the program. " 'Wheel of Fortune' is a 
wonderful show, but you don't watch 'Wheel of Fortune' to get information. 
There is a viewer benefit when you get information." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Challengers' is the obvious front-runner," says Carroll of the Katz 
consulting firm. "They've got the Big Mo. They were first in the marketplace, 
they have a good pilot, a credible host, an aggressive syndicator. Put that all 
together you've got deals." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, on the other hand, complains that "Challengers" is "derivative -- too 
much like 'Jeopardy!' for its own good." 
</P>
<P>
Sample pilot question: Name the two sons in "Death of a Salesman." 
</P>
<P>
* "Trump Card" -- Donald Trump has lent his name to the show, but not his body. 
The show is like bingo with the winner spelling out T-R-U-M-P. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now they have a name, they don't have a game," scoffs Carroll. "If I 
want to play bingo, I go to the parish hall." 
</P>
<P>
* "Name That Tune" -- Entertainer Peter Allen is set to host this remake. "They 
have a good pilot," says Feldman. "It's really more miscellaneous trivia than a 
quiz show." 
</P>
<P>
"It's played more for entertainment value than anything else," says Carroll. He 
found host Allen a little too much "like a hyperactive kid," but declared that 
"fixable." 
</P>
<P>
* "Quiz Kids Challenge" -- The first game show from movie moguls Jon Peters and 
Peter Guber will pit kids against adults in a battle of the brains.

MUSEUM DONORS EXHIBIT THE ART OF GIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philip and Beatrice Gersh collect art for an old-fashioned reason: They love 
the stuff. And they deal with their most valuable possessions in an 
old-fashioned way: They give them away. 
</P>
<P>
As owner of a long-established talent agency and a collector for 35 years, 
Philip Gersh has had calls from studio executives seeking advice on how to 
invest in art. His answer: "We don't buy that way. You have to buy because you 
love the art. If you are concerned about liquidity and investment, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
He and and his wife, who is a trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art, are 
dismayed by wealthy collectors who cash in on their art at auction. "They don't 
need the money," Philip Gersh scoffed. "You hear that certain pieces have 
become too valuable to keep in private collections. If the art is so valuable, 
it should be given to museums. The more valuable it is, the more reason that a 
museum should have it." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, before the art market zoomed into the stratosphere and before 
the 1986 income-tax law reduced art donors' deductions to the purchase price of 
an artwork, instead of the appreciated price, the Gershes' attitude toward 
their collection was relatively commonplace. But the new tax law has reduced 
gifts of art to museums by 63%, a study by the Assn. of Art Museum Directors 
shows. At the same time, rising prices have shut museums out of the market. 
With paintings going for $20 million, $30 million, $40 million or even $50 
million a pop at auction, generosity seems to be an idea whose time has passed. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the ethic of philanthropy an archaic notion? I'm afraid that's about 90% 
accurate," Philip Gersh said. That fear is part of the reason for a current 
show of the Gersh collection at the Museum of Contemporary Art. The exhibition 
at MOCA (to March 11) includes eight works that the Gershes have given or 
promised to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Prime among them is "Cubi III," an 8-foot-tall aluminum sculpture by David 
Smith, whose works have brought as much as $1.3 million at auction. When the 
show opened, the 1961 sculpture was promised to the museum, but the couple have 
subsequently made a "partial gift" of the valuable work and have agreed to give 
the piece entirely to MOCA soon. 
</P>
<P>
The towering sculpture -- which is one of two "Cubi" pieces still in private 
hands -- is essential to a contemporary art museum's collection, MOCA director 
Richard Koshalek said. 
</P>
<P>
Another "partial gift" from the Gershes is "Number 3," a small 1948 drip 
painting by Jackson Pollock, whose auction record is $10.5 million. The other 
Gersh gifts are less pricey but highly desirable acquisitions for the museum: a 
mixed-media collage by Alexis Smith, a photograph by Boyd Webb and paintings by 
Ed Ruscha, Susan Rothenberg, Neil Jenney and Tom Wudl. 
</P>
<P>
The Gershes hope that MOCA's show of their collection will encourage others to 
give. Their example has already produced at least two followers: their sons 
Robert and David Gersh who collect contemporary art and support the museum. 
</P>
<P>
"Collecting has enriched our lives," Beatrice Gersh said. "Art is not a 
commodity. It's something that gives great pleasure because of its quiet 
beauty, which can take many different forms. We feel strongly that the works we 
have should live together in our home and we've spent many years refining the 
collection." 
</P>
<P>
Every work that has become part of their collection has a life story. Wandering 
around the show and marveling at how different the art looks in a museum 
setting, the Gershes recounted tales of artworks bought in a fit of passion and 
others purchased after long periods of deliberation, dusty artworks rescued 
from storage bins and fresh ones snapped off delivery trucks. 
</P>
<P>
There are also stories about artworks lost and gained. One dealer reneged on 
the sale of a Jean Dubuffet collage when a more valued client wanted it, but 
then came through with a better piece. Beatrice Gersh once missed a Francis 
Bacon painting because her husband found it too disturbing, she said. Years 
later, when she saw Bacon's "Portrait of a Man With Glasses" in a London show, 
she announced that she wouldn't leave the gallery until they bought it. The 
small 1963 portrait is on view at MOCA in an intimate display of works by 
20th-Century masters. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early years Bea was way ahead of me, but now our eyes have adjusted to 
the point that we often go for exactly the same thing," Philip Gersh said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was ahead it's only because I devoted more time to it," Beatrice Gersh 
said. "One problem with many collectors starting out now is that they don't 
have any idea of the past and how it relates to the art of our time. You have 
to put in a lot of time, going to galleries and museums, looking and getting 
trained." 
</P>
<P>
The Gershes have never employed a curator or an adviser to tell them what to 
buy. Instead, they have taken their own education in hand, traveling widely to 
see exhibitions and continually working to keep up with the changing scene. 
</P>
<P>
They stand out as a rare example of public-spirited collectors, but they are 
not entirely alone in Los Angeles. Earlier this year, the Museum of 
Contemporary Art received a $60-million donation of classic modern and 
contemporary art from the Rita and Taft Schreiber collection. Among the 18 
works by 13 artists are paintings by Pollock, Mark Rothko, Piet Mondrian and 
Arshile Gorky, and sculpture by Alberto Giacometti. 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, MOCA has also received works by Christian 
Boltanski and Sarah Charlesworth from Peter and Eileen Norton; a John 
Chamberlain sculpture from Robert Halff; and Red Grooms' near life-size 
re-creation of a "Discount Store" from Irma and Norman Braman. Among other 
gifts, MOCA trustees Eli Broad and Douglas S. Cramer have each donated funds 
for the purchase of art. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art also has angels who remain devoted despite 
current tax laws. Pop singer Graham Nash recently announced that he will 
present the museum with about 140 photographs, plus half the profits from an 
upcoming auction of his photography collection. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond and Frances Bushell have donated 141 Japanese netsuke as part of a 
larger miniature sculpture collection promised to the county museum. Mary 
Stansbury Ruiz bequeathed more than 600 Mannerist prints to LACMA, while Hans 
and Varya Cohn have donated more than 200 examples of ancient, Sasanian, 
Islamic and Indian glass. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors Howard and Gwen Laurie Smits in 1987 gave the museum 171 
contemporary ceramic works and subsequently established an endowment fund for 
the purchase of 20th-Century ceramics. In making the gift, the Smits said that 
the donation was the best way to make "maximum use" of their collection. 
</P>
<P>
Film producer Ray Stark last year gave the museum Ellsworth Kelly's "White 
Sculpture II," a massive painted aluminum piece. "I have another one and I 
thought this sculpture would go well with the museum's collection," Stark said. 
Denying that he has "great altruistic motivations," Stark nonetheless said that 
he plans to give most of his sculpture collection to the County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a shame that the government discourages gifts of art. I can 
understand people who don't want to give now (under present tax laws), but my 
personal feeling is that eventually I would like most of my sculpture to go to 
the museum," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
The Gershes, like many other museum supporters, hope that income tax laws will 
be changed again to allow deductions for the appreciated value of art. "All our 
great museums have been endowed by great private collectors. The Reagan and 
Bush administrations have emphasized the responsibility of the private sector, 
but private collectors are selling at auction now -- and at astronomical 
prices," Philip Gersh said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple used to buy at auction, when bargains could be had, but now they 
stay away. And they entertain no thoughts of cashing in. "We're very happy in 
giving. We know people are going to enjoy the art," Beatrice Gersh said.

'FORBIDDEN CITY': SONG-AND-DANCE BRILLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1930s, Charlie Low came to San Francisco from his native Nevada, as he 
tells film maker Arthur Dong in "Forbidden City U.S.A." (tonight at 9, Channels 
15 and 28), "with different ideas in the back of my head." What emerged was a 
fairly stunning and charming episode in the history of America's cultural 
diversity: The first nightclub with an all-Chinese floor show. 
</P>
<P>
As in "Cabaret," where a Berlin nightclub became a medium through which the 
corrupt Weimar German society was revealed, Dong's film gracefully shows how 
one semi-underground club brought all manner of American contradictions to the 
surface. The young entertainers first had to break from centuries of cultural 
codes: that men ran the business, that women stayed at home and that 
performers' lives were sinful. 
</P>
<P>
Then, they had to prove their stuff to white producers and audiences. Like 
their non-white counterparts, the Asian-American hoofers and singers had to be 
twice as good as the white competition. But there was an extra burden -- the 
assumption, as one "Forbidden City" veteran recalled, "that Chinese couldn't 
swing." 
</P>
<P>
One look at the elegant film sequences of Paul Wing and Dorothy Toy -- billed 
as a kind of Chinese Astaire and Rogers, even though Toy was actually Japanese 
-- buries that silly claim forever. But, like much of "Forbidden City U.S.A.," 
the joy of uncovering this buried nugget of song-and-dance brilliance has a 
bittersweet edge. Once Hollywood beckoned the duo during the early days of 
World War II, the U.S. government barred Toy from employment because of her 
Japanese ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
Low's club just wasn't the same after the war. As Paul Wing notes: "The novelty 
wore off." Not even Chinese girls prancing around the room, dressed in nothing 
but big feathers, could draw them in. Dong's predictable style, cutting back 
and forth between talking heads and photos and footage, makes "Forbidden City 
U.S.A." less than it could be. And yet the now-old faces reveal the ticklish 
excitement of the days when they dared to do something sweetly forbidden.

WILSON WILL MAKE MUSIC WITH NEA GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It sure is a nice way to start the decade," said Gerald Wilson, who has just 
received a $20,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts under the 
American Masters Fellowship program. "Not just for the money, but because I'm 
happy to be of service by making some fresh music available to the community. 
</P>
<P>
"With this award," the Southland composer said, "I can do a few things for the 
orchestra that I haven't had the opportunity to do -- things I hope will be of 
lasting interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I went out on a tour, conducting various college orchestras -- 
Rutgers, Berklee and several others. After leading the college orchestras I 
donated 10 or 12 of my original compositions to their libraries." 
</P>
<P>
One of Wilson's stops, at the New England Conservatory, found him sharing a 
concert with George Russell, another grant recipient. Russell, 66, is a teacher 
at the Conservatory. Pianist-composer Cecil Taylor, 60, the third award-winner, 
has long been active as an avant-gardist and teacher at several Eastern 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with the music he plans to write under the funding, 71-year-old Wilson 
will expand his activities this year, taking his own band to leading jazz 
festivals across the country. Meanwhile, he is set for two weekends at Marla's 
Memory Lane starting Feb. 2 and a concert at the Wadsworth Theater on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Originally prominent as a trumpeter and arranger with the Jimmie Lunceford 
Orchestra, Wilson settled in Los Angeles in 1942 and formed his own Big Band 
two years later. He found out, the hard way, that keeping an 18-member band 
together in the post-Swing Era was as simple as juggling 18 balls in the air. 
But because he wanted a showcase for his unique, highly personal music, he 
never gave up. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been able to keep my music out there," he said, "with the help of Albert 
Marx, who's produced all my albums since 1961 -- first for Pacific Jazz, and 
now on his own Discovery Records. But I've been lucky enough to do quite a few 
other things." 
</P>
<P>
When band dates wore thin, he spent several years as the host of a record show 
on KBCA (now KKGO). From 1969 he taught jazz history at Cal State Northridge. 
Since 1983 he has been a part-time professor at Cal State L.A. In 1972 he 
composed the first of eight works performed at the Music Center by Zubin Mehta 
and the Los Angeles Philharmonic with a large gospel choir. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great honor," summed up Wilson, "particularly since this is not 
something you can apply for." 
</P>
<P>
Previous winner of the endowment fellowships have included Count Basie and 
Dizzy Gillespie-in both of whose bands Wilson played in the late 1940-and Ella 
Fitzgerald.

VENTURA BANK OPENS TRADING ON NASDAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the opening of the stock market today, shares of Ventura County National 
Bancorp will start trading on the NASDAQ National Market System -- the big 
leagues of over-the-counter market governed by the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, VCNB, whose main unit is Oxnard-based Ventura County National Bank, 
had been a "pink-sheet" stock that was thinly traded and virtually ignored by 
analysts. By moving to the National Market System, the stock's visibility among 
investors improves greatly. 
</P>
<P>
For William E. McAleer, president of the holding company and chairman of its 
bank, the new listing also could help his expansion plans for VCNB. 
</P>
<P>
VCNB, which caters mostly to local, mid-size businesses with annual sales of $1 
million to $50 million, has grown to $243 million in assets since it was 
founded by 11 local business people in 1982. VCNB is still a pipsqueak, but 
McAleer expects his bank to keep growing -- with its assets hitting $450 
million or $500 million by late 1990 -- in part by buying other banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plan is to add another acquisition, or at least be able to announce one, 
before the middle of next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking with four banks now," he added, declining to identify the 
potential partners. 
</P>
<P>
Once VCNB finds a bank to buy, it might want to purchase it with its stock 
rather than cash. In that case, having its stock on the National Market System, 
where many more investors are available to buy or sell the shares compared with 
the pink-sheet market, could make VCNB's offer more palatable to the target 
bank's sellers. 
</P>
<P>
For all of McAleer's growth plans, the likelihood is that, in the 1990s, VCNB 
will be bought. Beginning in 1991, East Coast banks will be allowed to buy 
California banks. In other areas of the nation where interstate banking has 
been introduced, tiny yet well-run banks like VCNB have been gobbled up. Of 
course, the bigger VCNB gets, the more likely its stockholders are to profit if 
the bank is acquired. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sell, because I need a job," McAleer said, adding that he 
hopes to keep VCNB independent. But the total value of VCNB's stock today is 
about $44 million, and VCNB's management would be hard-pressed to fend off any 
viable offer. 
</P>
<P>
McAleer -- who earned $185,000 in salary and bonuses in 1988 -- owns less than 
1% of VCNB's stock, and none of the bank's officers own more than 5%. Together, 
however, the officers and VCNB's employee stock ownership plan own about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it is not bought right away, VCNB must grow to survive in the early 
1990s after banks from the East Coast and elsewhere set up shop here. "It's 
going to take that critical size in order . . . to compete," McAleer said. 
</P>
<P>
VCNB already has bought two other business banks: Conejo Valley National Bank, 
based in Thousand Oaks, which VCNB bought in exchange for its stock in late 
1986; and Frontier Group, owner of the one-office Frontier Bank in La Palma, 
which VCNB bought for $8 million in mid-1989. The Frontier deal gave VCNB a 
beachhead in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But McAleer's sights are broader. "We have 19 areas within Southern California 
that we consider the areas of intense commercial-industrial growth," he said. 
Among them are the National City-San Ysidro and El Cajon areas near San Diego, 
and the Fontana-Upland region east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We would love to be in these areas," said McAleer, whose second-floor office 
is in a 14-story building that, with Union Bank's skyscraper, highlight 
Oxnard's financial center next to the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees with McAleer's approach, including Marshall C. Milligan, 
president of Levy Bancorp, the Ventura-based parent of the Bank of A. Levy and 
VCNB's neighborhood rival. Milligan's bank, which serves both consumer and 
business, is twice VCNB's size, with $582 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
"In contrast to VCNB, I don't believe in growth for growth's sake," Milligan 
said. "I frankly don't understand that strategy, and I don't understand the 
strategy of buying a bank in Orange County. We feel we serve the customer best 
when we target ourselves, as opposed to broadening our scope." 
</P>
<P>
McAleer said he bought Frontier, which kept its name, for a simple reason: "We 
could immediately make more money with it." Frontier is a small bank ($70 
million in assets) that had loaned out 52% of its deposits, compared to 85% at 
VCNB. Under VCNB's guidance, Frontier quickly put an additional $13 million of 
loans on its books and raised its pretax profit by $500,000, McAleer said. 
</P>
<P>
Frontier also gives VCNB entrance into the huge Orange County commercial 
market, he said, dismissing suggestions that Orange County already has plenty 
of hometown business banks. "None of them are large," that is, with assets 
above $500 million, he said. "There's a lot of room for competition." 
</P>
<P>
Whether McAleer can repeat that success in other parts of Southern California 
remains to be seen, but VCNB generally has maintained strong profits while it 
has grown. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1989, VCNB earned $2.1 million -- equal to its 
profit for all of 1988 -- and its return on average assets, or ROA, in the nine 
months and in 1988 were 1.22% and 1.10%, respectively, well above the 1% 
reading that is considered an excellent performance. An ROA shows how 
profitably a bank uses assets at its disposal. (The figure is found by dividing 
a bank's annual profit by its average assets for the period.) 
</P>
<P>
VCNB's only down year came in 1986, when its earnings plunged to $225,000 from 
$1.3 million the previous year. The drop reflected costs associated with VCNB's 
purchase of Conejo Valley National Bank. One of Conejo Valley's subsidiaries 
was saddled with problem loans, McAleer said. 
</P>
<P>
VCNB's stock price has advanced with its earnings growth. After going public at 
$10 a share in 1982, the stock now sells for the equivalent of $43.75 a share, 
if subsequent stock splits and stock dividends were excluded. (Adjusted for 
those items, the stock now trades at about $10 a share.) 
</P>
<P>
McAleer, a Los Angeles native, worked for Security Pacific, Barclay's and 
Orange County Bank in Southern California. He moved to Oklahoma in 1979 and 
held executive positions at two banks in the Tulsa area. He left Oklahoma just 
as the state's energy woes were about to make trouble for many banks there, and 
in 1982 got the job as VCNB's first president after seeing the bank's 
help-wanted ad in a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's searching for other banks to buy, but he noted that much of VCNB's 
growth is internally generated. VCNB attributes much of that growth to services 
it provides business customers, such as couriers to pick up deposits, and a 
computer system that enables clients to quickly monitor and adjust their 
checking accounts, investments and loans. 
</P>
<P>
McAleer still has a way to go just to impress his hometown rival, Levy 
Bancorp's Milligan. "They haven't taken a big chunk of our business," Milligan 
said. "They've been more effective at creating that image, but I don't think 
that actually translates into volume of business. We do a lot more business 
banking in the county than they do." 
</P>
<P>
But one thing Milligan can't dismiss: In seven years, VCNB has become half as 
large as Levy, which was founded 100 years earlier.

CHP, POLICE ARREST 250 MOTORISTS 
</P>

<P>
On what turned out to be an unusually quiet New Year's weekend, Orange County 
police agencies ushered in 1990 by rounding up more than 250 suspected drunk 
drivers and investigating sporadic reports of holiday gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the driving-under-the-influence, or DUI, arrests were made 
by the Costa Mesa police, Santa Ana police and California Highway Patrol, who 
conducted intensive crackdowns with roving patrols. 
</P>
<P>
Most other Orange County cities, however, reported only a smattering of DUI 
arrests during the three-day holiday, despite a new state law that, effective 
Monday, lowered the blood-alcohol level for drunk driving from 0.10% to 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police said they made only four DUI arrests all weekend, even though 
they set up sobriety checkpoints both Friday night and New Year's Eve and 
questioned more than 1,500 motorists. Two years ago, by comparison, Anaheim 
police arrested eight people on suspicion of drunk driving at a single New 
Year's Eve checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that, hopefully, people are finally wising up and letting their 
friends drive if they drink," said Anaheim Police Sgt. Frank Van DeWeerd. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, where police arrested three suspected drunk drivers, Sgt. 
Luis Ochoa attributed the low number of arrests to a dense layer of fog that 
blanketed many coastal areas and reduced New Year's Eve traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very, very quiet, which is unusual for us on New Year's Eve," Ochoa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hazardous driving conditions, Orange County law enforcement 
officials reported no upsurge in traffic accidents and no fatal accidents over 
the holiday weekend. The fog extended as far inland as Fountain Valley, where 
things were so slow that officers made only seven DUI arrests and were sent out 
on just four complaints of wild parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked years past where we couldn't stop" all night long, Sgt. Don 
Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday was also comparatively quiet in terms of gunfire from holiday 
revelers, a tradition in predominantly Latino areas of the county. Immigrants 
from Mexico and other Latin American countries, police officials say, are used 
to celebrating the new year with pistol shots into the air. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to past years, when hundreds of bullets rained down over vast 
portions of Orange County, only police in Santa Ana and Westminster had any 
significant shooting activity to report. Police attributed the apparent 
downturn in shooting to an education campaign that included the distribution of 
leaflets in Latino neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, seven mobile homes "took a round through the roof" from falling 
bullets, Lt. Greg Cooper said. Last year, by comparison, Santa Ana police 
fielded 24 reports of property damage from holiday gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
The only reported injury on New Year's Eve was to a pedestrian in Santa Ana who 
suffered a graze wound to the leg from one of the falling bullets. But Cooper 
said it was so superficial that the man did not require medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In Westminster, police received five reports of shots being fired into the air 
and recovered one pistol that had been discarded by a reveler as officers sped 
to one of the scenes. No damage or injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to last year, it was almost like there was nothing going on," 
Westminster Police Lt. Bob Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
The busiest police activity over the New Year's weekend was generated by the 
drunk-driving patrols instituted by the CHP and by police in Costa Mesa and 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa police arrested 46 suspected drunk drivers during a nine-hour 
enforcement program that began Sunday evening. The arrests, made by a 14-person 
task force on roving patrols, topped last year's arrest total by 16, Sgt. Tom 
Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very, very effective program," Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested were detained in Costa Mesa City Jail, which was staffed with 
extra personnel to process records and paper work, Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police, also operating in roving patrols, arrested 55 suspected drunk 
drivers during a special crackdown period between Friday afternoon and Monday 
morning, Lt. Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers arrested 101 motorists in the county during the same period, CHP 
spokesman Keith Thornhill said. The arrest breakdown included 46 in the CHP's 
Santa Ana district, 30 in the San Juan Capistrano district and 25 in the 
Westminster district, Thornhill said.

AFTER 5-PLUS YEARS OF DELAY, MURDER CASE TO BE HEARD

<P>
The Thomas Maniscalco case is about biker culture and murder -- three people 
shot down in their home in a middle-class Westminster neighborhood on Memorial 
Day weekend in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But in the five-plus years since Maniscalco's arrest, murder often has been a 
secondary issue in his case. Instead, the radical lawyer who helped found the 
Hessian motorcycle gang has pitted himself against the justice system, 
challenging the grand jury process, his judges, his prosecutors, and even his 
jailers. 
</P>
<P>
The case has also been plagued by problems no one could foresee -- including a 
major foul-up in a court reporter's transcript and even a judge's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the focus finally shifts back to the house on Navajo Road where 
two men and a young woman were found shot to death. Twelve jurors and six 
alternates will hear Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard M. King's opening statement 
about a tale of drugs and counterfeit money among the bikers, who lived 
incongruously in a neighborhood of working-class families and weekend 
barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco, prosecutors contend, may have been a lawyer by day, but at other 
times he was heavily involved in the trafficking of drugs and counterfeit money 
-- $500,000 in fake $50 and $100 bills. Maniscalco, now 44, was the leader of a 
group of younger people from the drug culture to whom he opened up his home, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
Internal problems in the group, they theorize, led to the execution-style 
murder of Richard (Rabbit) Rizzone, 36, who had been Maniscalco's best friend 
and had lived with him at times. The other two victims, they say, were simply 
unfortunate enough to be in the house with Rizzone. One of them was a 
19-year-old girl, killed after she was raped and then forced to lead the 
killers through the house to find Rizzone's keys. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco has denied killing the three. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco and Rizzone had grown up in New York together, had moved to 
California together, and were part of the group that founded the Hessians 
during the Vietnam War years. 
</P>
<P>
When Rizzone was arrested on drug charges in 1978, he listed Maniscalco's name 
in the "next of kin" box. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't kill Rabbit; Rabbit was my friend," Maniscalco said in a jailhouse 
interview several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors claim that the friendship of Maniscalco and Rizzone had waned. 
Maniscalco had told friends that Rizzone had taken for himself more than 
$30,000 in counterfeit money and also stolen drugs from him, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men living at Maniscalco's house, Robert Robbins, later testified 
that Maniscalco first tried to kill Rizzone by brushing poison on counterfeit 
bills he sent him, so that Rizzone eventually would ingest the poison off his 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
When that failed, Maniscalco and confederates Phil Warren, Daniel Duffy and 
Robbins went to Rizzone's home to kill him, Robbins said. Warren did the actual 
killing, Robbins testified. He alleges it was also Warren who raped the young 
woman, Rena Miley, before killing her. And, he said, it was Warren who killed 
Thomas Monahan, 28, a friend of Rizzone who stayed with him sometimes and who 
came to the house right after Rizzone was shot. But it was Maniscalco who was 
in charge, Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said Maniscalco ordered him to take Rizzone's Harley Davidson 
motorcycle with him when Robbins and Warren left for Michigan the next day. 
Prosecutors contend that Maniscalco planned to have Robbins killed, so that 
when the motorcycle was traced back to Rizzone, police would blame Robbins for 
the triple slaying in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco's lawyer, Joanne Harrold, has her own theories about what happened. 
She points out that another key witness against Maniscalco -- a biker named 
Bruce Van Arsdell -- ended up in Michigan with Warren and Robbins. The three of 
them, she contends, killed the people in the Westminster house and planned all 
along to make Maniscalco their fall guy. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco and Duffy, who now face a death penalty if convicted, were arrested 
in March, 1984, after Van Arsdell agreed to talk to investigators. He had been 
living with Maniscalco at the time of the shootings and has key evidence about 
the lawyer's activities unrelated to his law practice. 
</P>
<P>
Warren may have been a victim of his own fears of being arrested. He was 
questioned by police in Moore, Okla., on July 30, 1982, when he tried to use a 
phony name on a driver's license application. The surprised officers were 
forced to shoot him to death after he tried to kill both of them with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, who is under protection from the authorities, without question is the 
star witness. Prosecutor King will have to rely on many witnesses who either 
were engaged in criminal activities or are now in jail convicted of crimes. But 
his witness list also includes law enforcement authorities from five police 
departments, the FBI, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and 
the U.S. Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
King has declined to comment on the facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just delighted that finally the community is going to have its day in 
court," King said. 
</P>
<P>
King's office has been seething for years over the trial delays, almost all 
caused by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense has everything to gain and nothing to lose from delaying the 
trial," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Brent F. Romney, who has handled most of the 
pretrial motions. "Especially with the penalty their client could face." 
</P>
<P>
The first major problem was that charges were dismissed for tactical reasons so 
that Maniscalco could be indicted after a grand jury hearing. But the grand 
jury transcript was so riddled with errors it was unusable, and prosecutors had 
to seek a "superseding" grand jury indictment. It took more than a year and two 
trips to the state Supreme Court to resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The next issue to stall the case was Maniscalco's objections to Superior Court 
Judge Theodore E. Millard as the trial judge. Millard was a former prosecutor 
who had been peripherally involved with one of Maniscalco's former clients, who 
was also a potential witness in his case. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of court hearings, Millard decided in 1988 to excuse 
himself from the case, so that it wouldn't be delayed further. He was replaced 
by Judge James R. Franks II. But because of a serious illness, Judge Franks had 
to relinquish the case -- after he had already begun jury selection -- to Judge 
Kathleen E. O'Leary last summer. When Judge Franks committed suicide in August, 
the case was further delayed because he had been scheduled to finish up one 
stage of jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary ordered several hearings to run into the night -- from 8 a.m. to 7:30 
p.m. -- to prevent further delays in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
All of the judges on the case have faced a near avalanche of defense motions, 
many of which were not relevant to the case, prosecutors have claimed. 
Maniscalco's attorney Harrold and her co-counsel, Andrew Roth, also asked for 
sanctions against prosecutors, claiming they had deliberately withheld evidence 
to hamper the defense. O'Leary denied the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments were bitter at the least. 
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Harrold is lying," prosecutor King said at one hearing in O'Leary's court. 
"If Ms. Harrold were Pinocchio, her nose would grow so long it would go out the 
door and all the way down the hallway." 
</P>
<P>
Harrold seethed. But she has made biting comments of her own. "Prosecutors have 
resisted and interfered with discovery (providing the defense with information, 
required by law) repeatedly," she wrote in court papers. She called the 
Maniscalco case "a classic example" of an ongoing district attorney practice of 
not providing defense lawyers with evidence to which they are entitled. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the defense bristled again. Maniscalco had been ordered to court 
from the Orange County Jail on Thursday by mistake. On Friday, when Maniscalco 
was supposed to be in court, Harrold did not show up and Judge O'Leary had to 
wait into the noon hour for co-counsel Roth to appear instead at a final 
hearing. Prosecutors had asked for the court session to expand the dates on the 
papers charging Maniscalco with the murders, to include the Friday before 
Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is bizarre," Roth complained. "Five and a half years (go by) and they 
just now decide what day they want to say the murders occurred." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy D.A. Romney emphasizes that many of the defense motions were meritorious 
enough to resolve in court. But, he added, "far too many of them were frivolous 
in my opinion, and that's had a lot to do with why this case has taken so long 
to get to trial." 
</P>
<P>
Harrold blames prosecutors for the delays. In addition to the dispute over 
discovery, she criticizes King and Romney for trying to make it a drug and 
counterfeit case. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was defending a murder case," she said. "But Rick King is going to 
throw in everything he can to muddy up the waters." 
</P>
<P>
In his court papers, King contends that the counterfeit and drug evidence is 
important to show Maniscalco's motive for wanting Rizzone dead. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco has not been idle during his 5 1/2 years in jail. He has gained 
notoriety as a jailhouse lawyer and has been a leader in a move to improve jail 
conditions. Many claim, however, that Maniscalco has manufactured many of the 
complaints he has made about jail deputies beating inmates. Now his lawyers say 
his trial could be affected by his need for medical attention. He suffers from 
back pains and needs dental work. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony in the case will not begin until Wednesday. One person who will no 
doubt follow the Maniscalco case carefully from the Orange County Jail will be 
Duffy. His trial on the same charges is scheduled to follow Maniscalco's. 
</P>
<P>
"The witnesses are the same," one lawyer involved said. "If Maniscalco hangs, 
Duffy knows it will be bleak for him."

HOPES AND FEARS ARE BUILDING;

DEVELOPMENT: HUNTINGTON BEACH OFFICIALS SEE ALL THE CONSTRUCTION AS A GOOD

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bounded by the ocean on one side and thickly settled cities on the other, this 
80-year-old beach town would appear to have been built out long ago. 
</P>
<P>
But appearances are deceiving. The city, the third-largest in the county, 
expects to add about 35,000 residents over the next 20 years -- as many as the 
entire population of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
"The city currently has a population of about 189,000," said Hal Simmons, 
senior planner for the city. "By the time we reach build-out, which we forecast 
in 2010, the city will have a population of about 225,000." 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for former oil fields in the southwest corner of the city to be 
cleared for for a 768-acre housing and commercial development called 
Holly-Seacliff. North of the city, a development proposal for the Bolsa Chica 
area, long in dispute between builders and environmentalists, has been settled, 
clearing the way for several hundred homes to be built. The blighted downtown 
area is being redeveloped, and construction of new condominiums and apartments 
throughout the city is accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
The growth spurt -- expected to add about 15,000 homes by the year 2010 -- will 
mean more taxable income. It also is expected to bring more children to the 
city's school districts, which have suffered declining enrollments over the 
past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Riddell, executive vice president of the Huntington Beach Chamber of 
Commerce, said the new growth "is very exciting." The new housing will "bring 
increased tax increments to the city," Riddell said, "and the new residential 
areas will be nice additions to the city. The future is very bright for 
Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Diana Peters, superintendent of Huntington Beach City School District, whose 
elementary schools are in most of the areas targeted for growth in the 1990s, 
also was enthusiastic about the new residential developments. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, the district had been losing pupils for more than a decade. 
Peters said at least one new elementary school for 650 children may be needed 
to accommodate the expected jump in enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly more stimulating to be thinking about growth than (about) those 
years of declining enrollment, which brought about painful things such as cuts 
and layoffs," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
But there is also a downside to all the growth, some residents say. 
</P>
<P>
"I see large problems," said Loretta Wolfe, president of Huntington Beach 
Tomorrow, a residents group concerned about planning in the city. "This growth 
will bring an infrastructure problem -- things such as water availability and 
sewer capacity. The sewers are already at max in that area, and Coast Highway, 
which is the main link to the freeways from that area, is already overloaded." 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Easterling, a director of Huntington Beach Tomorrow, calls traffic "a 
major concern." 
</P>
<P>
"We're also concerned about density and open space," Easterling said. "The 
Holly-Seacliff development is so big it's like a city within a city." 
</P>
<P>
The final master plan for Holly-Seacliff is scheduled to go before the City 
Council at its Jan. 8 meeting. That plan, which the city staff has urged the 
council to approve, calls for 5,330 housing units, a neighborhood shopping 
center and business offices. The project would be built in the area bounded 
roughly by Ellis Avenue on the north, Huntington and Main streets on the east, 
Yorktown and Clay avenues to the south, and the bluffs west of Edwards Street 
on the west. The site is now mostly vacant except for a number of oil pumps 
that are scheduled to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays is bullish on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Holly-Seacliff will convert basically degraded land covered with oil wells and 
make it into one of the most beautiful areas of the city -- complete with at 
least four new parks in that area," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
To the west of the Holly-Seacliff area, about 5,000 new houses have been 
proposed for the bluffs near the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after years of legal wrangling between environmentalists and Signal 
Landmark Corp., the principal landowner and developer, a settlement was reached 
that will allow development to proceed. The terms of the agreement call for 
Signal Landmark to donate a large share of the land for use as wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Mays is also optimistic about this project. 
</P>
<P>
"Bolsa Chica will go from 300 acres of restored wetlands to 1,150 acres -- one 
of the largest wetlands on the California coast, while still allowing 
development on the bluffs," Mays said. "The restored wetlands are going to be 
such a tourist attraction that we expect people will be coming from all over to 
see this area." 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Chica is outside the city limits, but Huntington Beach intends to annex 
the area as development gets under way. James Colangelo, director of the county 
Local Area Formation Commission, said that the Bolsa Chica has already been 
placed in Huntington Beach's "sphere of influence," a step leading to eventual 
annexation. 
</P>
<P>
In the downtown area near the pier, about 336 acres along Pacific Coast Highway 
and Main Street are being redeveloped to include luxury condominiums, hotels 
and a shopping area. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the old dwellings have been replaced by higher-density residential 
units," Simmons said. "We expect an increase of about 5,000 more units of 
housing from the recycling that is going on in the downtown area." 
</P>
<P>
Mays said planning is the key to coping with the changes expected to occur with 
the new growth of the '90s. 
</P>

"We want to maintain the level of service we now have for our residents while 
growing to handle the new residents," Mays said. "I think planning is very 
important, and I'm working for a strategic plan that would look at a 10-year 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can plan for growth in a proper fashion, then the up side of that growth 
will be that we will be able to develop an economically viable base for the 
city, with enough revenue to maintain and improve the current services of that 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be city with a redeveloped downtown that is the real hub of 
activity -- the most viable downtown in the entire county."

PAIR FIGHT TO KEEP CANYON FROM BEING TURNED INTO BALLPARKS

LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art Padgett and Charles Gorenstein acknowledge that Chapparosa Canyon, a 
narrow, seven-acre gorge hemmed in by rows of new stucco houses, is not much to 
look at. 
</P>
<P>
Home to several deer, a few hawks, toads and crawfish and some scattered clumps 
of bulrushes, the small canyon is not as visibly stirring as the expansive 
Laguna Canyon or the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
But the grassy slice of rural countryside, a reminder of what Laguna Niguel 
once was, has stirred the two men to launch a campaign to save it. 
</P>
<P>
Chapparosa Canyon, the largest wetlands canyon that remains in rapidly growing 
Laguna Niguel, is scheduled for extinction under a city plan to convert the 
shallow gorge into ball fields. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said there are not enough playing fields in Laguna Niguel, 
and, as a consequence, hundreds of youngsters have been unable to join 
organized sports. 
</P>
<P>
Pledging their opposition to the project, Gorenstein and Padgett have founded 
the Laguna Niguel Environmental Coalition and are pressing for preservation of 
the canyon as natural open space. 
</P>
<P>
Padgett, an engineering consultant, and Gorenstein, a UC Irvine professor of 
neural pharmacology, are lobbying to see the canyon transformed into an 
educational nature center instead of baseball diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
"This canyon is a diamond in the rough," said Gorenstein, who suggests planting 
native California shrubs, grasses and trees to create a living museum for area 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a showplace for Laguna Niguel," Gorenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon, between Street of the Golden Lantern and Niguel Road, is fed by an 
underground spring that drains into Salt Creek and eventually into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
It is part of the 260-acre Salt Creek Community Park, much of which is now 
undeveloped but may in the future be used for a variety of recreational 
purposes, City Manager Warren S. (Ben) Benson said. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon, next to the 18-acre Chapparosa Park, would be filled in with 
130,000 cubic feet of dirt from Monarch Beach, and two ballparks would be built 
on the resulting flatland as an addition to the four existing fields in 
Chapparosa Park, Benson said. 
</P>
<P>
Australia-based Qintex America Inc. has agreed to complete the $2.6-million 
ball fields as part of an agreement with the city for a development project in 
Monarch Beach, Benson said. He said that despite the company's recent financial 
problems, the agreement remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Qintex, which backed out of a plan to develop a Dana Point 
resort in November, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Gorenstein and Padgett, however, said they have repeatedly proposed that the 
city find an alternate site for the ball fields. 
</P>
<P>
The public comment period on the project's environmental impact report ended 
Jan. 1, but coalition members have spent the past few weeks passing out 
thousands of flyers to drum up support for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
They have also escorted City Council members on a tour of the canyon and have 
urged residents to send letters of opposition to City Hall. So far, Benson 
said, city officials have received about 150 statements of opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The pair are scheduled to meet with Mayor Patricia Bates today to discuss their 
plan to build a nature center. 
</P>
<P>
Padgett and Gorenstein's effort is the latest in a growing trend in the South 
County to preserve what is left of undeveloped areas around suburban 
neighborhoods. Slow growth, in fact, has been a major political issue among San 
Clemente and San Juan Capistrano officials, who have been faced with cries to 
protect the shrinking open space. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the San Juan Capistrano City Council passed a law to preserve 
its miles of ridgelines and announced a plan to turn 120 acres of land north of 
Mission San Juan Capistrano into a "Central Park." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Canyon and Laguna Beach residents have been fighting development plans 
in their communities, and San Clemente officials have criticized a proposal to 
build a regional airport in the hilly country north of their city. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is becoming more and more sensitive to issues of environment," 
Gorenstein said. "We talk about saving the rain forests and the whales. But 
there is something wrong if we can't save a simple canyon in our own back 
yard." 
</P>
<P>
Padgett added: "City Council members don't appear as sensitive to environmental 
issues as we thought they would be. It's almost as if they were 
pro-development." 
</P>
<P>
Several city officials said they have seriously been considering the 
coalition's suggestions but have not made up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen James F. Krembas, Paul M. Christiansen and Thomas W. Wilson said 
they support the concept of a nature park but also see a need for more 
recreational facilities for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"I take exception to the comments that any of the council members are not 
responsive to the concerns over the environment," said Krembas, principal of 
San Clemente High School. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one side, I understand their concerns. But on the other side, we need 
more ball fields." 
</P>
<P>
Krembas said that he would prefer to relocate the playing fields. "I consider 
myself a strong advocate for the environment. That canyon is a unique area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials have so far been unable to find a suitable alternative site 
for the playing fields, Krembas said. "We will have to take a good hard look at 
the issue."

AUDUBON, IRVINE CO. PROTECT THE HERONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Bloom used to watch the great blue herons on Irvine Lake when he played 
there as a child. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bloom is vice president of the Sea and Sage chapter of the Audubon 
Society and he is working with the Irvine Co. on a plan to build new homes in 
his childhood playground without disturbing the county's largest colony of the 
giant, graceful birds. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom and Ginny Chester, also of the Audubon Society, helped negotiate the East 
Orange General Plan, which was approved by the Orange City Council in December, 
so that the Irvine Co.'s development plans would not endanger the heron. 
</P>
<P>
At Bloom's suggestion, the company agreed to relocate two housing tracts and 
preserve 200 acres of wild oak groves near the proposed Limestone Canyon 
Regional Park. It also agreed to a five-year study and relocation plan for a 
colony of great blue herons that nest on the north shore of the lake where the 
company wants to build a road. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 pairs of herons nest in sycamore and oak trees along the shore of the 
Irvine Lake, also known as Santiago Reservoir. The Irvine Co. has agreed to 
either get the birds to move to new nests or abandon its plans to build a road 
there, said Lee Jones, resource specialist for Michael Brandman Associates, 
which prepared the environmental impact report for the development. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, biologists will determine where the herons eat, how many are 
breeding successfully and where they go in the winter. They will also 
coordinate the study with the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and the state 
Department of Fish and Game, Jones said. Leg bands will be placed on the young 
birds to keep track of them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After studying the birds, the biologists hope to encourage the herons to nest 
somewhere else, either along the southwest edge of the lake, on an island in 
the lake or elsewhere in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, herons are found along the Santa Ana River, Bolsa Chica 
Reserve, Upper Newport Bay, San Joaquin Marsh, Anaheim Lake and Dana Point 
Harbor. Bloom said the Irvine Lake rookery is the largest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the relocation program might include the planting of vegetation at 
other sites and the use of nesting platforms or heron decoys to encourage the 
birds to breed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
After monitoring the new nesting site for three years and conducting annual 
counts of the breeding colonies, biologists will decide whether they can 
develop in the area without damaging the heron colony. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the Audubon Society and the Irvine Co., the road 
could be built if at least 50% of the birds from the Irvine Lake rookery are 
nesting elsewhere. If not, the company could continue the relocation program or 
abandon its plans to build the road. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Irvine Co. does this right, meaning funding the study properly, this 
could be a one-of-a-kind study," Bloom said. Not much is known about the habits 
of great blue herons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Adult great blue herons stand three to four feet high, with a wing span of 
about six feet. Sometimes mistaken for cranes, herons can be distinguished from 
other birds by the U-shape of their neck in flight. 
</P>
<P>
Although they were hunted for their colorful blue-gray plumage earlier in the 
century, great blue herons are not now listed as endangered or threatened. But 
biologists say that development has reduced the habitat of herons, putting them 
at risk. SHANNON SANDS

COUGAR POPULATION APPEARS STABLE

<P>
Orange County's mountain lions, faced with encroachment by housing development 
and highways, have so far held on, actually managing to carve a wild niche in 
an increasingly urban environment. 
</P>
<P>
Three new litters this year have added to a population of about 35 of the 
pale-brown hunters, and though several of the cubs have probably died young, 
researchers say the lion population appears stable, at least for the time 
being. These days, lion sightings in the county are not uncommon, with at least 
two unconfirmed reports a month, according to Tim Miller, manager of the 
county's regional parks. 
</P>
<P>
But the lions' habitat is fast disappearing, and experts fear that their time 
in Orange County could soon end unless action is taken to buffer them from 
people. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal to protect those habitats will go before California voters in 
June, and would set aside $30 million a year to protect habitats, $10 million 
of which would be targeted toward deer and lion areas. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would also permanently ban sport hunting of mountain lions, but 
wildlife experts are unconvinced that the ban is needed. Mountain lions, also 
known as cougars or pumas, are not endangered, and in fact have staged a 
decade-long comeback in California, rebounding from a population of less than 
1,000 in the early 1970s to between 2,500 and 6,000 today, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no biological justification for the hunting ban," said Paul Beier, 
project director of an Orange County mountain lion study that has collared and 
tracked cougars in the county since 1986, when, in separate incidents, two 
children were attacked and mauled by lions at Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness 
Park, near San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
During that study, nine lions have been collared, and seven currently carry the 
radio transmitters. Using those devices to track and map the cougars, Beier and 
his colleagues have been able to determine that they range over wide areas in 
and around Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Each of four females living near Caspers Park, for instance, has established a 
"home range" of up to 77 square miles, traveling mainly along canyon bottoms 
and hunting deer mostly at night. 
</P>
<P>
Although the lions do not seek contact with humans and attacks are rare, the 
crush of civilization brings lions and people ever closer. That worries some 
experts, who hope to save the lions and protect humans at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question but that conflicts are going to occur," Miller said. 
"We've got all these young kittens out there, and the growth is, of course, 
continuing. We're concerned. That's why we're studying the lions very 
carefully." JIM NEWTON

PEOPLE: TRUMPETER SPREADS THE JOY OF MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Douglas Thompson has spent most his life playing music for the love of it. 
</P>
<P>
Financially, "I'm not doing too bad, but then again I'm not doing too great," 
said Thompson, who favors the trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
Many times, "When I'm at a low ebb, I've had to find jobs outside music to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach resident decided at age 21 to become a professional 
entertainer. Later he wanted to be a professional trumpet player. He finally 
settled on being a band leader and director. 
</P>
<P>
While he currently works in customer relations at a car agency, Thompson is the 
director of the Businessman's Band, although not all the players are 
businessmen. In fact, the band has had several names including Music Man's 
Band, Fountain Valley Community Band and Band X. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Thompson went to Washington as a member of what he said was the 
world's largest non-marching marching band. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't march, we just played march music," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of joy working with my music and with people in music," said 
trumpeter Thompson, who sometimes switches to piano, trombone or drums. "I've 
always said if you do music for the money in it, then you're not doing music." 
</P>
<P>
Added Thompson: "In fact, serious musicians are strictly in it for the 
creativity, love and sharing of music and that's the 100% feeling most of us 
have." 
</P>
<P>
But while there is love for music, "a musician has to keep his financial life 
on an even keel and that's why I have to take a number of different jobs," he 
continued. "It goes with being a musician." 
</P>
<P>
And he knows of what he speaks. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in college (Cal State Los Angeles) I titled my term paper "Earning 
a Living as a Musician," which he said addressed the problem of keeping body 
and soul together while being an artist. 
</P>
<P>
He also attended Orange Coast College and Huntington Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Thompson is attempting to develop a 200-member community band that 
he hopes will consist mainly of businessmen, but that is open to "anyone who 
can read music and play," as he put it. 
</P>
<P>
The current 32-member band rehearses Thursday nights at Costa Mesa High School 
and plays at Orange Coast College football and basketball games as well as 
other community functions. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who once was assistant director of a U.S. Army band in West Germany, 
complains about the small number of community bands in Orange County as well as 
the limited number of places for adults to learn and perform music. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see a complete dry-up in community performing arts training," 
moaned the one-time church choir singer who said he was part of 13 performing 
arts groups when he was 17. 
</P>
<P>
After his Army discharge, Thompson went to Sacramento in hopes of persuading 
lobbyists and legislators to push for more funding for the performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a whole lot of performing arts training going on and the future 
of musicians was at stake," he said. "It was difficult getting the attention of 
the right people." 
</P>
<P>
But later, besides his work with community bands and orchestras, he also got 
the attention of Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1974 we formed Band Explorer Post 808," said Thompson, who was the post 
leader. "The Boy Scout Council said it was the first (such band) ever formed in 
the western half of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Some scoundrel stole the American flag from the Garden Grove home of Lu and 
Paul Bole, who have flown the flag atop a 25-foot pole 24 hours a day for the 
past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Word about the theft reached Mac McCullock, Americanism co-chairman for the 
Garden Grove Elks Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Within a day he presented the couple with a flag that had been flown over the 
Capitol in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Flying the American Flag is an important part of the Elks Americanism 
program," he said.

PACIFIC STORM BRINGS AREA CHANCE OF RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small Pacific storm will bring cloudy skies and a 50% chance of showers to 
Orange County today, but provide little relief from the drought, the National 
Weather Service predicted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a small system moving through. However, it is not going to give us 
what we need," a weather service spokesman said. "This certainly won't affect 
the drought. We could catch up later this year, you never know." 
</P>
<P>
The front moving through Southern California this morning could bring a 
quarter-inch of rain along the coast and one-half to three-fourths of an inch 
in the mountain areas. Snow is predicted above 5,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
As the front moves east into the deserts, forecasters say, the chance of 
showers will diminish from 50% to 30%, leaving partly cloudy skies tonight. 
Clear, cool and windy weather is expected Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lows will be in the upper 40s except for some inland valleys, which could get 
temperatures as low as 35. Highs will be in the low 60s. Winds up to 15 m.p.h. 
will come out of the south and shift to west-to-northwest with velocities of 20 
to 30 m.p.h. by this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, a low-pressure system stretched along the East Coast from Canada 
through New York, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania and Maryland into Virginia, 
bringing rain and raising temperatures into the 40s and 50s. Intermittent rain 
and fog clouded parts of the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
Light snow and freezing rain made end-of-the-holiday traveling hazardous in the 
Great Lakes region, the upper Ohio Valley and parts of the northern Atlantic 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
A cold front brought rain to much of the South, where temperatures were 
generally mild. Meanwhile, a dry air mass covering much of New Mexico, 
Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana drove temperatures down overnight 
Sunday and early Monday, to the teens in the Texas Panhandle and the 40s in the 
Rio Grande Valley.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: CROOKS' VALUE TO EDISON CAN BE FOUND OFF THE BOARDS

<P>
Talia Crooks wasn't named the most valuable player of last week's Marina girls' 
basketball tournament, but her value to the Edison High School girls' 
basketball team was all too evident. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Coach Philip Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
"(Tournament MVP) Debbie Fischer has been stealing the limelight, but Talia is 
the reason we are able to play teams with big posts," Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
From pillar to post, Crooks, the Times' Athlete of the Week, had her way last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Crooks, 5-feet-9 and 140 pounds, is averaging 11 rebounds and 12 points this 
season. She had 44 rebounds and 47 points in four games of the Marina 
tournament as Edison (9-2) upset Ocean View, 58-53, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"Talia is really quick and she uses that," Abraham said. "She's thin but 
muscular. 
</P>
<P>
"Laura Finch and Talia set solid screens and they are really good at rolling to 
the hoop." 
</P>
<P>
Crooks is not Edison's primary offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Talia gets most of her points off of rebounds and post moves," Abraham said. 
"She has a good sense for the ball and tremendous timing, which is so important 
for rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a great volleyball player and that helps with timing." 
</P>
<P>
Crooks agrees. "I think volleyball has helped. I'm not that great a jumper but 
I work at it," she said. "In volleyball you learn to jump with the timing of 
the set ball, so I guess I'm used to it (timing rebounds)." 
</P>
<P>
Hard work and concentration also help hone rebounding skills, and Crooks posts 
high marks in those areas too. 
</P>
<P>
She had 11 rebounds against Lakewood's front line of three 6-footers in 
Edison's 56-54 victory last week. That takes a little more effort for a 5-9 
player than letting the ball bounce into her hands. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't just 6-footers," Abraham said. "They were all legitimately good 
players. But Talia's presence is constantly felt on the floor. She plays clean 
and always plays very hard." 
</P>
<P>
And Crooks doesn't care how tall the opposition is. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't intimidate me just because they're taller," Crooks said. "The first 
thing I look for is to rebound. I hurry to get position and screen out. We're a 
running team, so usually the tall girls are slower and don't keep up." 
</P>

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: WHITLOCK GIVES LOARA MORE THAN A SHOT IN THE ARM 
</P>

<P>
Two things could be predicted about the Loara High School basketball team the 
last two seasons: Tes Whitlock would score a lot and the Saxons would lose a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, Whitlock averaged about 15 points a game and Loara won five only 
games. Last year as a sophomore, he averaged 22.7 and the Saxons won four. 
</P>
<P>
This season, there has been quite a turnaround. Whitlock is averaging 30.8 
points, but the Saxons are 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Saxons' best start in the history of the school and the most games 
they have won in a season since 1978, also the last time they qualified for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't score 28 (last year) we weren't even close," Whitlock said. "This 
year I can score 14 and we can still win." 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't happened often this season for Whitlock, the Times' Athlete of the 
Week. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, he scored 40 points, including 17 of the team's 19 first-quarter 
points, in Loara's 70-65 victory over Pacifica in the championship game of the 
Pacifica tournament. He also scored Loara's first 17 points, making his first 
seven shots. He made 14 of 20 shots in the game, missing only a dunk and five 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock, whose full first name is Monttes, scored 108 points in three 
tournament games and was named the most valuable player of the event. He also 
led Loara to the championship of the Garden Grove tournament earlier in the 
month and was named the MVP. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a mistake if opponents believe that they can stop the Saxons if they 
can stop Whitlock, said Coach Jerry Halpin, who is in his first season at 
Loara. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just a Tes team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Whitlock scored 27 of Loara's 37 first-half points against Pacifica, the 
Saxons still trailed by five. It was only when other Loara players contributed 
that the game was turned around. Whitlock only scored 13 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Halpin said Whitlock, who moved with his family from Chattanooga, Tenn., before 
the seventh grade, has improved his perimeter shooting since last season when 
opponents would stop his drives and force him to shoot outside. 
</P>
<P>
"He's killing people who are doing that to him this year," Halpin said. 
</P>
<P>
But Whitlock, who is averaging 8.8 assists, isn't selfish, Halpin said. He only 
takes shots when he is open and there are no plays designed to get him the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I get a lot of individual attention, but the team knows I'm with them," 
Whitlock said. "It's not just me. We won two tournaments together." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Guard Augustin Heredia of Estancia averaged 21 points in four games to lead the 
Eagles to third place in their tournament. Heredia scored 26 points on Saturday 
as Estancia defeated Los Alamitos, 79-60. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee Parks averaged 26 points and 12 rebounds for Marina in the Orange 
tournament. Wednesday, he had 37 points and 19 rebounds, making 14 of 15 field 
goals in an 82-71 overtime victory over El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda's Keith Walker set a school record on Saturday by making 26 of 28 
free throws as he scored 47 points in the Wildcats' 84-53 championship victory 
over Compton in the Brea-Olinda tournament. Walker also had 16 rebounds and six 
assists before fouling out with a minute to play.

RAM NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
IF GIANTS ARE LOOKING FOR HELP, THEY WON'T GET IT FROM MEDIA

If the Rams adhered to Buddy Ryan's pregame philosophy, they'd already be 
sinking their teeth into the New York Giants, this Sunday's NFC divisional 
playoff game opponent at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Taylor? That wimp? The same All-Pro linebacker who was held to two 
excuse-me tackles and no sacks in the Rams' 31-10 thrashing of the Giants in 
November? What's this washout doing on a playoff team? 
</P>
<P>
No such bulletin-board luck for the Giants. The Rams know better, having just 
wiped a week's worth of juiced-up quotes in the face of Ryan's Philadelphia 
Eagles in the form of a 21-7 wild-card victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will make it a point to low-key their approach against the Giants, 
despite having dominated the NFC East champions the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, quarterback Jim Everett tossed five touchdown passes in the 
Rams' 45-31 win over the Giants in the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Last Nov. 12, at Anaheim Stadium, the Rams flattened the Giants, 31-10, in a 
game they led, 31-3, at one point in the fourth quarter. New York shared the 
NFC's best record entering the game at 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have sacked Everett just once in the two meetings. Ram left tackle 
Irv Pankey seems to have what it takes to stop Taylor, who was invisible in the 
November game, drawing public address attention only for two penalties called 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams match up well against the Giants across the board. 
</P>
<P>
You could say the Rams had the Giants' number, but the Rams wouldn't dare. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a chance to play them in the playoffs yet," Everett said. 
"There's no doubt we think they're a good football team. It'll probably be much 
different. They wouldn't have the record they have if they're not a good 
football team." 
</P>
<P>
What kind of game does tailback Greg Bell think it's going to be? Another rout 
like the previous two? Bite your tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a very physical game," Bell said. "We know each other, we've 
been fortunate to come out the victors the last two times we met. I know we're 
going to approach the game the same way we approached this one (against 
Philadelphia). It's going to be a dogfight and it's going to last until there's 
one second left on the clock. If we're in control of the ball, the last five 
minutes, we're going to run the clock out." 
</P>
<P>
Bad question/good answer: Everett, who has passed for 8,274 yards and 60 
touchdowns the past two seasons, was asked after Sunday's game if he felt he is 
starting to arrive as an NFL quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I arriving?" Everett responded. "I hate that question. You guys be the 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Everett feels that he hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I base my arriving on something that has to do with the (Super)Dome this 
year," he said. "My judgment of what a quarterback is, is one who wins the 
Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
After 14 seasons in the league, Ram offensive tackle Jackie Slater has seen it 
all. Oh, really? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't gotten to the point where I think I know it all," he said. "All you 
have to do is go out to practice and have some of these youngsters beat you. 
It's a humbling enough experience. My position is one where you've constantly 
got to work to stay good at it, otherwise you get dominated." 
</P>
<P>
Slater proved again Sunday that he's still good enough. He limited Eagles' 
All-Pro defensive end Reggie White to one sack. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't getting any easier, though. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys like Reggie White and Bruce Smith keep popping up," he said. "They get 
bigger, faster and stronger. They're guys that can dominate. I hate to think 
how big and fast offensive and defensive linemen are eventually going to get." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's win over Philadelphia was the Rams' first playoff win since they 
defeated the Dallas Cowboys, 20-0, in a first-round divisional game in 1985. It 
was team's first wild-card win since a win over Dallas in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been awhile," Pankey said. "I think everybody believes. We've been 
through our four-week stretch where we lost games in the last 28 seconds. We've 
been to the down side." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' all-linebacker pass rush team of Kevin Greene, Brett Faryniarz, 
George Bethune and Fred Strickland averages 244 pounds per man if you believe 
the team's current weight listings. Don't believe them. The average is closer 
to 235 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Any more questions about the Rams being wimps in cold weather? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many times you have to play in bad weather to become a 
bad-weather team," guard Tom Newberry said after consecutive wins at New 
England and Philadelphia, both games played in less-than-desirable conditions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE RAMS BY THE NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
Highlight 
</P>
<P>
JACKIE SLATER 
</P>
<P>
No one, least of all the loud-mouthed Philadelphia Eagles, had to tell this 
14-year pro that he and his mates had to provide maximum protection for 
quarterback Jim Everett if the Rams were to win Sunday's NFC wild-card game. In 
Reggie White and Jerome Brown, the Eagles have two of the league's premier pass 
rushers. So, Slater and his offensive line mates responded with one of their 
finest efforts of the season, not only limiting the Giants to two sacks but 
giving Everett sufficient time to complete 18 of 33 passes for 265 yards and 
two touchdowns.
