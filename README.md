I've included examples of:<br/><br/>
    Java (.java)<br/>
    C++ (.cpp)<br/>
    PHP (.php)<br/>
    HTML <br/>
    JQuery <br/>
    CSS (.css) <br/>
    Smart Templating Language (.tpl)<br/>
    SQL (for MariaDB Galera Cluster)<br/>
    <br/>
    Information Retrieval A1 was coded in 3 languages out of interest to test performance of PHP, Java and C++.<br/>
    <br/>
    ShopsBee is coded in PHP and is an ecommerce solution, the client site templates use the Smarty Templating Language. Thus 4/5 languages are used for this solution (PHP, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Smarty, SQL)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I can upload more code examples in other language (assembly, C, C#, OpenGL) on Monday 13th August once I fix my laptop.
