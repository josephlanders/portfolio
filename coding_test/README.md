HelloWorld.java demonstrates the following:<br/>
<br/>
Method 1 - Create a list via recursion and print via iteration<br/>
Method 2 - Create a tree via recursion, storing child nodes in employee.childEmp and recursively call to print<br/>
<br/>
I've split it into two separate files HelloWorld1 and 2.

I forgot to throw Exceptions, but I am aware that one can extend Exception etc etc.
